Abstract 
3	  
Objectives: There has been considerable inconsistency and confusion in the definition of 
4	  
elite/expert athletes in sport psychology research, which has implications for studies 
5	  
conducted in this area and for the field as a whole. This study aimed to: (i) critically evaluate 
6	  
the ways in which recent research in sport psychology has defined elite/expert athletes; (ii) 
7	  
explore the rationale for using such athletes; and (iii) evaluate the conclusions that research in 
8	  
this field draws about the nature of expertise.  
9	  
Design: Conventional systematic review principles were employed to conduct a rigorous 
10	  
search and synthesise findings.  
11	  
Methods: A comprehensive literature search of SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES 
12	  
and Academic Search Complete was completed in September, 2013 which yielded 91 
13	  
empirical studies published between 2010 and 2013. The primarily qualitative findings were 
14	  
analysed thematically.  
15	  
Results: Eight ways of defining elite/expert athletes were identified, ranging from Olympic 
16	  
champions to regional level competitors and those with as little as two years of experience in 
17	  
their sport. Three types of rationale were evident in these studies (i.e., “necessity”, 
18	  
“exploratory” and “superior”); while findings also indicated that some elite athletes are 
19	  
psychologically idiosyncratic and perhaps even dysfunctional in their behaviour. Finally, only 
20	  
19 of the 91 included studies provided conclusions about the nature of expertise in sport.  
21	  
Conclusions: This study suggests that the definitions of elite athletes vary on a continuum of 
22	  
validity, and the findings are translated into a taxonomy for classifying expert samples in 
23	  
sport psychology research in future. Recommendations are provided for researchers in this 
24	  
area.

 Defining Elite Athletes: Issues in the Study of Expert Performance in Sport Psychology 
3	  
Whether out of envy or admiration, we have long been fascinated by the breath-taking 
4	  
feats of expert or “elite”1 athletes, such as the footballer Lionel Messi or the tennis star Rafael 
5	  
Nadal, who can perform apparently impossible skills with remarkable consistency and 
6	  
precision. In an effort to understand the cognitive and neural processes that underlie such 
7	  
exceptional skills, researchers in disciplines such as cognitive psychology, sport psychology, 
8	  
motor learning/skill acquisition, kinesiology and neuroscience have developed a field of 
9	  
inter-disciplinary inquiry that is concerned with the scientific study of ‘expertise’ or the 
10	  
growth of specialist knowledge and skills through effortful experience (see Ericsson, 1996, 
11	  
for a detailed introduction). Although empirical research on expertise is little more than four 
12	  
decades old, psychological speculation about the nature and determinants of eminence in 
13	  
human achievement dates back at least as far as Galton (1869). Interestingly, whereas the first 
14	  
modern studies in this field (in the 1960s and 1970s) were conducted mainly on performance 
15	  
in formal knowledge domains such chess (e.g., see de Groot, 1965; Chase & Simon, 1973), 
16	  
more recent research (since the mid-1990s) has explored expert-novice differences in largely 
17	  
perceptual-motor domains such as dance (Bläsing et al., 2012) and sport (e.g., Müller et al., 
18	  
2010; Williams & Ford, 2008). Regardless of the domain under investigation, however, 
19	  
research on expertise is now a “hot topic” in psychology. To illustrate this trend, expertise 
20	  
has attracted distinctive methodological paradigms (e.g., Ericsson, 2013; Ericsson & Ward, 
21	  
2007); special issues of academic journals such as Applied Cognitive Psychology (Ericsson, 
22	  
2005), Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied (Ericsson & Williams, 2007) and 
23	  
Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology (Williams & Ericsson, 2008); several scholarly 
24	  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1 We shall use the terms elite and expert interchangeably, as did Starkes and Ericsson (2003).

handbooks (e.g., Ericsson et al., 1996; Staszewski, 2013); and considerable interest from 
1	  
popular science writers (e.g., Colvin, 2008; Gladwell, 2009; Syed, 2010). Arising from this 
2	  
confluence of research activity, evidence has accumulated to show that expert athletes differ 
3	  
consistently from relative novices with regard to a variety of perceptual, cognitive and 
4	  
strategic aspects of behaviour (see summary in Eklund & Tenenbaum, 2014). For example, 
5	  
compared to their novice counterparts, expert athletes tend to have a more extensive 
6	  
knowledge-base of sport-specific information and to be more adept at using this knowledge 
7	  
efficiently to identify, remember and manipulate relevant information in their specialist sport. 
8	  
To summarise, on the basis of the preceding evidence, it seems reasonable to conclude that 
9	  
research on expertise is a thriving and productive scientific endeavour.  
10	  
Unfortunately, this latter conclusion may be challenged on the grounds that there is 
11	  
considerable confusion and inconsistency among expertise researchers with regard to the 
12	  
criteria used to define the term “elite” or “expert” athlete (Polman, 2012). For example, 
13	  
despite widespread acceptance of the “ten year rule” (Hayes, 1985) – or the assumption that it 
14	  
takes about 10 years of sustained deliberate practice to become an expert in any field or 
15	  
10,000 hours (as popularised by Gladwell, 2009) – the terms “elite” and “expert” have been 
16	  
ascribed to athletes with as little as two years of accumulated practice (e.g., Welch & 
17	  
Tschampl, 2012). Similarly, they have been applied in a rather cavalier fashion to such 
18	  
heterogeneous samples as Olympic champions (e.g., Grant & Schempp, 2013), professional 
19	  
performers (Jordet & Elferink-Gemser, 2012), inter-varsity athletes (e.g., Steiner et al, 2010), 
20	  
members of national squads (Bertello et al, 2012), and athletes who were simply part of a 
21	  
competitive team (Voss et al, 2010). Clearly, such imprecision in the criteria used to define 
22	  
participants as “expert” athletes threatens the validity of research on expertise in sport. For 
23	  
example, at a theoretical level, it is difficult to draw valid conclusions about expertise from 
24	  
studies in which experts have been defined using significantly different criteria. 
25

----- Page 6 (native) -----
5  
Unfortunately, the extent of this definitional problem at the heart of expertise research has not 
1	  
yet been investigated systematically. Furthermore, few guidelines are currently available to 
2	  
help researchers define “expertise” as objectively as possible in the study of sport  
3	  
Against this background of confusion, the present paper attempts to fill three main 
4	  
gaps in the field by providing a review of research that has sampled elite/expert athletes. 
5	  
First, we aimed to analyse, and evaluate the validity of, the definitions used by researchers 
6	  
studying such participants. Second, we aimed to explore the rationale provided by the authors 
7	  
of these studies for employing elite/expert athlete samples. This information is crucial in 
8	  
determining the extent to which these studies sought to increase theoretical understanding of 
9	  
expertise. Thus our third aim was to explore the general theoretical conclusions that have 
10	  
been drawn about expertise from research with these athletes. 
11	  
Method 
12	  
Development of Search Strategy 
13	  
Our review used conventional systematic review principles in order to ensure the 
14	  
rigorous selection of studies based on replicable criteria (cf. Smith, 2010; Centre for Reviews 
15	  
and Dissemination [CRD], 2009). To begin, a list of key words was trialled in a preliminary 
16	  
search on the SPORTDiscus database, and the findings from this exploratory search were 
17	  
reviewed so that the most efficient and effective search terms could be identified. The main 
18	  
focus of this review was definitions relating to elite or expert athletes, and therefore we 
19	  
primarily sought to retrieve studies which explicitly used these terms. Other relevant terms 
20	  
(e.g., “skilled” or “experienced”) were initially trialled but combining these with elite/expert 
21	  
produced either an excessively high (over 280,000) or overly restrictive (just 300) number of 
22	  
possible inclusions, and therefore the terms elite/expert were prioritised. Furthermore, this 
23	  
review was primarily concerned with sport psychology research, but to capture studies from 
24	  
overlapping areas (such as motor control/performance and skill acquisition) we also included 
25

----- Page 7 (native) -----
6  
cognitive psychology and neuroscience in the search. The trialling process also identified a 
1	  
number of irrelevant terms that were designated as ‘limiters’ to be removed them from the 
2	  
final results. The list of search terms employed was: 
3	  
(elite OR expert*) AND athlet* AND sport AND (psychology OR neuroscience) 
4	  
NOT (adolescent OR youth OR junior OR review) 
5	  
The databases deemed to be most relevant (based on accessibility and relevance to the topic 
6	  
area), and therefore searched via EbscoHost, were SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, 
7	  
PsycARTICLES, and Academic Search Complete.  
8	  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
9	  
Inclusion/exclusion criteria were employed to ensure that the boundaries of the review 
10	  
were clearly defined, and that the search strategy would identify all literature relevant to the 
11	  
aims of the review (CRD, 2009; Smith, 2010), while also keeping the number of inclusions 
12	  
manageable (which we deemed to be less than 100). The studies included in this review 
13	  
needed to be: (i) peer-reviewed research studies published in the English language; (ii) 
14	  
published (either in paper or online) between 2010 and September, 2013 when the formal 
15	  
search was finalised; (iii) original empirical, primary evidence/data; (iv) concerned primarily 
16	  
with either sport psychology or cognitive psychology/neuroscience (e.g., published in 
17	  
journals in these fields); (v) ones that explicitly described their sample as “elite” or “expert” 
18	  
in either the title or abstract (e.g., studies were excluded if they mentioned expertise but 
19	  
described their sample as  “skilled” instead); (vi) ones that explicitly referred to elite athletes, 
20	  
and not coaches, referees, parents, or panels; (vii) ones that involved sporting activities as 
21	  
defined by the Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science and Medicine (Kent, 2006); (viii) ones 
22	  
that did not refer to young, junior, or adolescent elite athletes in the title, abstract or full-text 
23	  
(unless they also used, and provided data about, elite athletes in their sample); and (ix) as a 
24

----- Page 8 (native) -----
7  
final measure to help reduce the number of returns towards the ‘manageable’ threshold, all 
1	  
included studies needed to be published in journals with an impact factor. 
2	  
Search Returns 
3	  
 
The search process was finalised on the 14th of September, 2013, and initially returned 
4	  
731 potentially relevant studies. After duplicates and studies not published in English were 
5	  
removed, the titles and abstracts of the remaining potential targets were assessed for 
6	  
relevance. This step reduced the potential target papers to 240 articles. Another 80 papers 
7	  
were removed because they were not published in journals with an impact factor. Full-text 
8	  
copies were then obtained for the remaining 160 studies, after which a further 69 were 
9	  
excluded either because: (a) they stated in-text that they used young/junior athletes; (b) they 
10	  
were not sufficiently focused on psychology; or (c) they did not explicitly describe their 
11	  
sample as elite or expert (e.g., some mentioned ‘expertise’ in the abstract but referred to their 
12	  
sample as ‘skilled’ or ‘experienced’ instead). In total, 91 studies published in 28 different 
13	  
journals met the inclusion criteria (as described in Table 1). All of the current paper’s authors 
14	  
were involved in the process of determining which studies should be included. In cases where 
15	  
studies did not clearly meet criteria, discussions took place until all authors agreed on how to 
16	  
proceed (i.e., either by including or excluding the studies in question). 
17

18	  
Data Extraction and Synthesis 
19	  
 
Once the final 91 studies had been identified, the relevant sections in each were 
20	  
repeatedly read by the lead researcher (first author) in order to become familiar with, and 
21	  
immersed in, the data to fully appreciate its significance (see Maykut & Morehouse’s [1994] 
22	  
concept of indwelling). Data pertaining to the three main research questions were extracted 
23	  
by the first and third authors, and included in an audit trail which was verified by all authors 
24	  
(e.g., by processes of peer debrief and investigator triangulation; see below). As the data were 
25

----- Page 9 (native) -----
8  
primarily qualitative, a process of thematic analysis was used to identify, group, and 
1	  
summarise the most relevant issues/themes emerging from the included studies (Pope, Mays, 
2	  
& Popay, 2007). A team approach to analysis was adopted whereby each of the authors was 
3	  
presented with the table of extracted data and separately analysed it before offering critical 
4	  
feedback and reaching agreement on the results (e.g., key themes that emerged).  
5	  
Reliability/Trustworthiness 
6	  
Since qualitative analysis procedures were used to categorise the data (i.e., see 
7	  
thematic analysis; Braun & Clarke, 2006), a number of processes were followed in order to 
8	  
enhance the trustworthiness, quality, and rigour of our work (Seale, 1999; Sparkes & Smith, 
9	  
2009). The issue of reliability was addressed by attempting to achieve consensus in article 
10	  
inclusion, as well as during data extraction and data coding. To facilitate researcher 
11	  
triangulation, peer debrief (e.g., Creswell & Miller, 2000; Lincoln & Guba, 1985) was also 
12	  
employed. This process took place between the lead researcher (first author) and the second 
13	  
and third authors who provided guidance on the process of conducting the review, and on 
14	  
research on expertise in sport. Peer debrief took place throughout this study, by way of 
15	  
regular formal meetings and informal discussions. Finally, the audit trail discussed above was 
16	  
created and checked by all three authors to enhance transparency. This document is available 
17	  
on request from the first author.

Results 
19	  
General Findings 
20	  
The 91 papers included in this review comprised a total population size of 8572 
21	  
elite/expert athletes, made up of 3482 males (40.6%) and 2598 females (30.3%) – the 
22	  
remaining 29.1% of the sample were in studies which did not denote the sex of their athletes. 
23	  
101 independent samples were included as some papers reported more than one study. 
24	  
However no athletes were used twice in the samples in these studies. Overall, 59 studies 
25

----- Page 10 (native) -----
9  
employed whole samples from one single sport, whereas 28 studies used multi-sport samples, 
1	  
and four did not describe which sports their athletes competed in. The most frequently-
2	  
sampled sports were football/soccer (N=16), swimming (N=16), basketball (N=14), and 
3	  
rowing (N=12). By contrast, the least frequently-sampled sports included mountain running, 
4	  
adventure racing, roller hockey, artistic roller-skating, windsurfing, and bowls (all N=1). In 
5	  
the case of 13 studies, the whole sample was not used because they included athletes who did 
6	  
not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., they were novices). In these latter cases, we 
7	  
used details for the expert athletes only.   
8	  
Definitions of Elite/Expert Athletes 
9	  
The 91 included studies explicitly described their samples as elite and/or expert. Eight 
10	  
broad categories of definition of elite/expert athletes emerged, all of which are summarised in 
11	  
Table 2. Where the studies provided a mean value (e.g., for “years of competitive 
12	  
experience”), all available scores were added and divided by the number of studies to identify 
13	  
an average for the sample as a whole. Interestingly, some studies provided a range of 
14	  
definitions for the sub-samples used, for example in the 28 studies that included athletes from 
15	  
more than one sport, such as regional level to international level (Chan & Hagger, 2012; 
16	  
Young & Salmela, 2010). This means that, for example, the studies defining their athletes at 
17	  
regional level did not necessarily mean that the whole sample was at that standard. It should 
18	  
also be noted that many studies provided multi-faceted definitions for their sample which 
19	  
could span a number of the categories below. Each of the eight forms of definition is 
20	  
described below, in order of decreasing frequency of usage.  
21	  
[INSERT TABLE 2 NEAR HERE] 
22	  
International and/or national competitive level.  This theme was reported most 
23	  
often by the studies, with 61 (67% of the sample) defining elite/expert athletes as those 
24	  
competing at international and/or national level. It was difficult to separate international and 
25

----- Page 11 (native) -----
10  
national level (e.g., due to studies reporting themes such as competing at international and/or 
1	  
national level; N=14), while other athletes who represent their country or national team 
2	  
(N=25) could potentially be competing at both national and international level at that time in 
3	  
their career. The sub-categories ranged from those with success at major international 
4	  
competitions such as the Olympic Games or World Championships (e.g., medals, titles or 
5	  
records; N=6), to those participating/competing at national level (N=12), and national second-
6	  
level (e.g., Wu et al, 2013). Participation in national leagues was reported by five studies 
7	  
that did not disclose the professional status of the league, implying amateur status. 
8	  
Furthermore, in some cases there were differences between international amateur level and 
9	  
professional international level. For example, Bernier et al, (2011) included some golfers who 
10	  
had participated in international amateur tournaments, and others who had competed on 
11	  
various professional tours (Alps Tour, Challenge Tour, European Tour). 	  
12	  
Experience. The second most common way of defining elite/expert athletes was in 
13	  
terms of their experience, as reported by 45 studies (49% of the sample). In particular, the 
14	  
sub-category experience in general was reported by 24 studies (26% of the sample), with an 
15	  
overall mean of 12.7 years, ranging from 2-27 years’ experience in the sport. Indeed, in 
16	  
compiling samples of alleged expert athletes, Abreu et al (2012) included performers with as 
17	  
little as 468 hours experience in their sport while Welch and Tschampl (2012) included 
18	  
athletes with a minimum of 24 months experience. Other definitions based on experience 
19	  
included competitive experience (N=8; M=9.69 years; Range = 4-20 years), although five of 
20	  
these did not specify which level of competition that was. Others reported experience at elite 
21	  
level (N=7; M=6.98 years; Range = 4 months-35years) or international level (N=2; M = 5.63 
22	  
years; Range = 2-8years). Finally, experience of elite training (N=4; M = 5.71 years) was 
23	  
reported, as well as experience at national level (M = 13 years) and games played for country, 
24	  
which were both reported by one study each.  
25

----- Page 12 (native) -----
11  
 
Professionalism. The third common definition was in regard to professionalism, 
1	  
reported by 27 studies (29.67% of the sample). Being professional athletes was the most-
2	  
reported sub-category with 13 studies, while playing in professional leagues was also 
3	  
reported relatively frequently (N=12). The leagues involved ranged from top level for the 
4	  
sport in that country (e.g., Swedish Premier League in football - Ivarsson et al, 2013; top 
5	  
professional Spanish leagues for basketball, handball, roller hockey and indoor football – 
6	  
Mach et al, 2010) to second and third ‘tier’ (e.g., English Championship Division football - 
7	  
Morgan et al, 2013; B and C Italian series professional leagues in basketball - Abreu et al, 
8	  
2012). Finally, semi-professional football/soccer and tennis players were also used in this 
9	  
definition (N=3), while one study reported athletes who received commercial sponsorships.  
10	  
Training time/frequency. Elite/expert athletes were also defined in terms of the 
11	  
amount of training they completed, which was reported by 17 studies (18.68% of the sample). 
12	  
This training load was reported in terms of daily amount (N=2; M=6.5 hours/day) and weekly 
13	  
duration (N=12; M=13.1 hours; Range = 4-48 hours). Weekly frequency (N=6; M = 5.7 
14	  
times/week; Range = 3-16 times) was also used, and some studies only employed athletes 
15	  
who trained at least 5 times a week (Babiloni et al, 2010; Bertello et al, 2012; Del Percio et 
16	  
al, 2011), or practiced 5-7 days a week (Ivarsson et al, 2013; LeCouteur & Feo, 2011).  
17	  
Participation in elite talent development programmes. Eleven studies (12% of the 
18	  
sample) defined elite/expert athletes as those involved in talent development, or more 
19	  
specifically, members of elite sport institutes/training centres (N=7) or national development 
20	  
programs (N=3). One other study also used athletes in receipt of athletic scholarships. One 
21	  
example of this category was Carless and Douglas (2013) whose athletes were “registered on 
22	  
the UK Sport Council’s athlete support program.” 
23	  
Regional level competition. Nine studies defined their elite/expert athletes as those 
24	  
competing at regional level, which equated to 15.4% of the sample. More specifically, five 
25

----- Page 13 (native) -----
12  
studies referred to regional level, four used state level, and three referred to provincial level. 
1	  
It should be noted, though, that no samples exclusively used athletes at this standard, and 
2	  
instead they were included in larger samples of different sports and varying standards – 
3	  
possibly alluding to the use of these athletes on the grounds of convenience/ease of access. 
4	  
Objective sport/country specific measures. Nine studies reported sport-specific 
5	  
definitions of elite/expert athletes (9.9% of the sample). The most common of these was golf 
6	  
handicaps (N=5; M = 0.44), ranging from -2 (Bernier & Fournier, 2010) to 10 (Beilock & 
7	  
Gray, 2012). Other measures used to define elite/expert athletes (and reported by one study 
8	  
each) included black belt in martial arts (Welch & Tschampl, 2012); triathletes’ V02 peak 
9	  
scores (which ranged from 58.6-72.6mLkg-1 min-1; Terry, Karageorghis, Mecozzi Saha & 
10	  
D’Auria, 2012); the French Rating Scale of Difficulty in climbing (vales from 7b1 to 8b 
11	  
where 7a or above was classed as elite; Sanchez, Boschker & Llewellyn, 2010); and athletes 
12	  
registered as elite on a ministerial list compiled by the French government (Demulier, Le 
13	  
Scanff & Stephan, 2013).  
14	  
University level. Finally, elite/expert athletes were also defined as those competing at 
15	  
university level, and were reported by seven studies (7.69% of the sample). Specifically, 
16	  
three sub-categories reported: NCAA Division 1 in America (N=1); Varsity athletes in 
17	  
America and Italy (N=2); university students (who also competed in certain sports; N=2); and 
18	  
those participating on university teams in China and Canada (N=2).  
19	  
 Additional Factors in Describing Elite/Expert Samples 
20	  
Some studies claimed that their samples were distinct from other high-level athletes 
21	  
due to the amount of success that their athletes had achieved, for example, Macquet et al 
22	  
(2012) made the case that their participant had participated in the world orienteering 
23	  
championships for 14 years and had won gold seven times: “Based on this record, it is 
24	  
arguable that he is currently the world’s best orienteer, and also one of the best ever” (p.93). 
25

----- Page 14 (native) -----
13  
Similarly, Grant and Schempp’s (2013) participants “totalled 24 gold, 6 silver, 5 bronze 
1	  
Olympic medals, and 55 world records, represent(ing) the most accomplished group of 
2	  
swimmers studied to date” (p.157). Thus researchers have suggested that identifying the best 
3	  
of the best involves extensive experience and repeated success at the highest level.  
4	  
 
However, there also appears to be differences between sports that influence how well 
5	  
athletes can be compared to one another. For example, Storm et al (2012) referred to the 
6	  
differences between sports in terms of opportunities to progress: “we are aware of differences 
7	  
between the sports (involved) with regard to the athletes’ opportunities to progress from 
8	  
national to international elite owing to the diverse prevalence and spread of their sport” 
9	  
(p.205). To illustrate, athletes from the most commonly-used sports in these samples 
10	  
(football/soccer, basketball, rowing, swimming) which have high participation rates are likely 
11	  
to have faced extensive competition in order to reach the highest level. Conversely, athletes 
12	  
from lesser-used sports (e.g., artistic roller-skating, windsurfing, adventure-racing, or roller 
13	  
hockey), which have lower participation rates, are likely to have faced less competition in 
14	  
their journey to the highest levels. Thus athletes from sports with higher participation rates 
15	  
could be at a relatively superior athletic standard, and it is important to consider the 
16	  
competitiveness of the sport in which such elite/expert athletes are involved.  
17	  
It should be also noted that some studies defined their non-expert groups at higher 
18	  
standards than the elite groups in other studies. These included athletes who had competed at 
19	  
district to national level (Neil et al, 2011); while Hlldorsson et al (2012) employed “second-
20	  
level athletes” as a control group, which consisted of four established Premier League teams 
21	  
in soccer, handball and basketball. Therefore it appears that there is inconsistency both in 
22	  
defining elite/expert athletes, but also between definitions of elite and non-elite athletes.  
23	  
Generating Insights into the Nature of Expertise 
24

----- Page 15 (native) -----
14  
At the outset, it seems reasonable to assume that research conducted on expert athletes 
1	  
should lead to general (i.e., domain-free) and logically warranted theoretical insights into the 
2	  
nature of expertise. In order to test the first part of this proposition, we analysed the results 
3	  
and discussion sections of the 91 empirical studies whose data had been obtained from 
4	  
samples of expert athletes. From this analysis, as Table 3 shows, it is evident that only 19 of 
5	  
these 91 studies (20.9%) contained authors’ theoretical conclusions about the nature of sport 
6	  
expertise.  
7	  
In order to assess the extent to which the authors’ conclusions are warranted by the 
8	  
data that they collected, we examined the criteria used to define “expert” participants in each 
9	  
of the preceding 19 studies. In general, the stated conclusions appear to be logically valid 
10	  
because the vast majority of these 19 studies used conventional criteria (such as 
11	  
national/international representative honours to define expertise, e.g., Babiloni et al, 2010; 
12	  
Jowett & Spray, 2013). Nevertheless, one study defined expertise using a criterion of 
13	  
accumulated hours of practice which started with less than 500 hours – a figure that falls 
14	  
significantly below conventional criteria such as the 10 year rule (Gladwell, 2009) or the 
15	  
minimum requirement of 3000 hours proposed by Campitelli and Gobet (2011). Thus Abreu 
16	  
et al. (2012) reported that the expert basketball players in their study of action obeservation 
17	  
networks “had accumulated around 468-6,552 h of practice...since they had initated playing” 
18	  
(p. 1647). Unfortunately, the authors’ subsequent conclusions about the existence of “an 
19	  
expertise-specific network” (p. 1653) are not tempered by any acknowledgement of the 
20	  
limitations of their criterion of expertise. 
21	  
Justifying Expert Samples 
22	  
To better understand the apparently limited value of the conclusions drawn in many of 
23	  
the studies, we analysed the reasons why they chose expert samples. We expected that the 
24	  
justification for studying elite athletes and the conclusions drawn from the research would be 
25

----- Page 16 (native) -----
15  
related (i.e. where strong valid justifications existed, we expected to see novel and 
1	  
generalizable conclusions about expertise). 
2	  
[INSERT TABLE 3 NEAR HERE] 
3	  
The first and least important rationale for sampling experts was labelled necessity 
4	  
since the nature of the questions or phenomena these papers considered necessitated an expert 
5	  
sample. The majority of these studies – 13 of the 20 in this category – focused on the 
6	  
dysfunctional aspects of being an elite athlete, such as the eating disorders, doping, and 
7	  
burnout. Whilst these studies are important in terms of improving our understanding the 
8	  
dysfunctional aspects of elite athlete psychology, they do not develop new theoretical 
9	  
conclusions about the nature expertise, since it is not their purpose to do so. The only two 
10	  
papers in this category that did offer new theoretical insights (see Table 3) concerned optimal 
11	  
elite development pathways (Storm et al, 2012) and the effects of conscious thought on golf 
12	  
putting kinematics (Toner & Moran, 2011). 
13	  
Of the 91 studies we analysed, the most common justification for sampling experts 
14	  
was exploratory. The studies drawing on this rationale (N=29) often contained a version of 
15	  
the phrase “little is known about x”, signalling a gap in the research, often on a psychological 
16	  
phenomenon. Further analysis revealed that 20 of the 29 studies explored cognitive and 
17	  
psychological states and traits of experts that are otherwise well understood, such as attention 
18	  
and motivation. Six of the remaining studies explored the use of psychological skills by 
19	  
experts, such as imagery and goal setting, presumably with the intention of discovering 
20	  
repeatable best practice. In addition to the 29 exploratory studies, there were also a further 14 
21	  
papers that contained no explicit rationale for sampling experts, though we suggest that many 
22	  
of these papers, too, were drawing on an implicit exploratory rationale. It was interesting to 
23	  
note that, despite the often-explicit goal of exploring hitherto unknown phenomena with 
24

----- Page 17 (native) -----
16  
experts, only four of these 43 studies generated relevant theoretical conclusions about the 
1	  
nature of motor expertise (e.g., Bruce et al, 2013; Farrow et al, 2010; Jowett & Spray, 2013).  
2	  
Conversely, the second largest group of studies explicitly set out to test hypotheses 
3	  
about the nature of expertise in sport. We labelled the rationale for these studies superior 
4	  
since they often assumed or theorized that experts are cognitively or psychologically superior 
5	  
to novices and sub-elite athletes, often with respect to perception, anticipation and decision-
6	  
making. Within the sample of 32 papers containing this rationale, 17 explicitly attributed the 
7	  
hypothesized superiority to training, often making reference to ‘deliberate practice’ as the 
8	  
cause of heightened cognitive functioning. For example, Roca et al (2012) make explicit their 
9	  
view that “the amount and type of activities that elite soccer players engage in may provide 
10	  
some indication of the antecedents of expert performance” (p.1644). Given the dominance of 
11	  
the theory of deliberate practice in the field since the 1990s (Baker & Young, in press), it is 
12	  
perhaps unsurprising that only five of the papers attributed superiority to genetic traits or 
13	  
‘gifts’, whilst another 10 studies made no attempt to explain the source of the athletes’ 
14	  
assumed cognitive superiority. Unlike the exploratory papers, however, this category tended 
15	  
to make more explicit their theoretical conclusions about expertise. Approximately one third 
16	  
of the studies using the superior rationale (13 of 32) were considered to contain general novel 
17	  
insights into the nature of expertise in sport (see Table 3). 
18	  
Discussion 
19	  
Defining Elite/Expert Athletes 
20	  
 
As expected, we found inconsistency. A wide range of definitions were identified, 
21	  
from Olympic gold medallists and world-record holders, to regional and university level 
22	  
athletes. These findings can be placed in context by exploring the suggestion that there are 
23	  
two types of samples which can be used when employing elite/expert athletes (Williams & 
24	  
Ford, 2008; Chi, 2006). The first has been termed the study of absolute expertise, or the 
25

----- Page 18 (native) -----
17  
absolute approach (Chi, 2006), in which a small sample of truly exceptional athletes are 
1	  
studied with the intention of discovering how they perform successfully in their chosen sport. 
2	  
“This approach studies the remarkable few to understand how they are distinguished from the 
3	  
masses” (Chi, 2006, p.22). Alternatively, the relative approach involves comparison of 
4	  
experts to novices, and one group is defined relative to the other: “This relative approach 
5	  
assumes that expertise is a level of proficiency that novices can achieve...the goal is to 
6	  
understand how experts become that way so that others can learn to become more skilled and 
7	  
knowledgeable” (Chi, 2006, p.23). However as Williams and Ford (2008) acknowledged: 
8	  
“the disadvantage with this approach is that it fosters considerable variability in relation to 
9	  
the level of participants employed making it difficult to compare and synthesise findings 
10	  
across studies and sports” (p.12). We found evidence that experts may be international calibre 
11	  
athletes in one study, whereas in another they may be varsity performers or even lower. A 
12	  
similar problem exists with the classification of the novice group, and some non-expert 
13	  
groups were defined at a higher standard than elite/expert groups in other studies. While 
14	  
these assumptions may be relevant in other domains, it is perhaps not as possible to assume 
15	  
that novices will reach the same standards as experts in sport. For example, genetics could 
16	  
play a bigger role in sport than in other domains, evidenced by programmes such as Sporting 
17	  
Giants in the UK, which aimed to recruit athletes for the London 2012 Olympics rowing, 
18	  
handball, and volleyball teams (Sporting Giants, n.d.). This program sought individuals based 
19	  
on their age, height, and all-round sporting ability, but importantly, no prior experience in 
20	  
those sports was needed. Some of these athletes went on to win world championship medals, 
21	  
and even Olympic gold (Cullen, 2012). Furthermore, there are more objective criteria for 
22	  
judging expertise in sport than in other domains (e.g., Ericsson & Towne, 2013). Hence we 
23	  
argue that elite/expert athletes should be defined by one set of consistent, valid criteria rather 
24	  
than adopting the two approaches advocated by Chi (2006). 
25

----- Page 19 (native) -----
18  
The definitions identified in the present study vary on a continuum of validity, with 
1	  
some athletes unquestionably elite, whilst others plainly were not. Specifically, our findings 
2	  
can be synthesised into three main themes to judge the validity of elite athletes within their 
3	  
sport, and two further themes which can be used to determine validity of sport expertise 
4	  
across sports. These themes are discussed below, while we also identify a number of the most 
5	  
problematic definitions used by researchers within the studies included in this review. 
6	  
Athlete’s highest standard of performance. Almost 70% of the included studies 
7	  
used athletes at performing at national and/or international level, implying that the athletes 
8	  
are at least among the best in their country at that sport. Furthermore, professional status was 
9	  
reported by almost 30% of the studies and also appeared to be a useful indicator of expertise 
10	  
in sport, that is, if the athlete is at a standard through which they can make a living from the 
11	  
sport. While both of these seem to be valid ways of defining elite athletes, it should also be 
12	  
noted that there are varying levels or ‘tiers’ for both. For example, competing at 
13	  
national/international level varies between amateur and professional levels (e.g., in golf; 
14	  
Bernier & Fournier, 2010); and even in professional sports there is often a top tier (e.g., 
15	  
Premier League in soccer; European Tour in golf), second-tier (e.g., Championship soccer in 
16	  
England; Challenge Tour in golf), third-tier (e.g., League 1 soccer in England; Alps Tour in 
17	  
golf), and even fourth-tier (e.g., League 2 in England). All of these involve professional 
18	  
athletes, yet vary considerably in terms of playing standard.  
19	  
Athletes involved in talent development are by definition considered to have the 
20	  
potential to reach the highest standards in their sport. However, the important point is that it 
21	  
is still just potential – there is no guarantee that they will actually ‘make it’ to the highest 
22	  
level. Therefore it is difficult to suggest that these athletes are fully elite/expert. Similarly, 
23	  
athletes at regional level are not likely to be as proficient as those competing nationally or 
24	  
above, and it is more difficult to confidently class these athletes as elite or expert. Finally, 
25

----- Page 20 (native) -----
19  
some NCAA Division 1 athletes at top sport universities in the USA which have a tradition of 
1	  
excelling in a certain sport could be argued to be relatively elite. However only one NCAA 
2	  
Division 1 sample was included in the studies reviewed, and even then, this sample included 
3	  
athletes who did not play regularly for the team (Ciana & Sheldon, 2010). Other samples 
4	  
included university students/teams from China, Italy and Canada which do not have systems 
5	  
that are as competitive as that in the USA, and therefore university-standard alone does not 
6	  
seem to be a particularly valid definition for elite athletes. 
7	  
Success at the athlete’s highest level. As well as performance standard, the athlete’s 
8	  
level of success was also a valid indicator of their expertise. For example, nine samples of 
9	  
athletes who had won titles or medals, or who held records, at international level – six of 
10	  
which were in major international tournaments such as the Olympics or World 
11	  
Championships. National titles also suggest that the athlete has achieved a certain amount of 
12	  
success in their sport, and corresponding to the levels/tiers of performance standards 
13	  
described above, success at regional, university, or 4th tier level is likely to be the lowest 
14	  
validity of defining sport expertise.  
15	  
Experience at athlete’s highest level. The amount of experience the athlete had at 
16	  
their own highest level was a further indicator of eliteness, although not to the same extent as 
17	  
the two themes described above. For example, athletes who have competed at regional level 
18	  
for an extensive period of time should not be considered equal to those who have competed at 
19	  
the highest international level for a limited period of time. The mean experience at elite in the 
20	  
included studies was seven years, ranging from four months to 35 years. Thus, this 
21	  
continuum adds detail to the themes above.  
22	  
Low-validity definitions. As well as the three themes described above, a number of 
23	  
questionable definitions emerged from the analyses. The most questionable definitions were 
24	  
those that did not provide detail of performance standard, and instead were more experience 
25

----- Page 21 (native) -----
20  
or involvement based. Over 25% of the included studies described their samples in terms of 
1	  
the athletes’ general experience within their sport. Some of these were as little as 24 months 
2	  
(Welch & Tschampl, 2012), minimum of 3 years and even 468 hours (Abreu et al, 2012) of 
3	  
involvement in a certain sport and seem highly questionable (e.g., in relation to the ‘ten-year 
4	  
rule’; Hayes, 1985). While the overall mean of 12.7 years between these studies may exceed 
5	  
the ‘ten-years rule,’ it does not provide any indication of these athletes’ standard of 
6	  
performance, and even suggests over-reliance on a misinterpretation of that rule. Indeed: 
7	  
(The) experience-based definition of expertise without a concurrent validation by 
8	  
observed superior performance was found to be problematic in the early 1990s...Most 
9	  
people know from firsthand experience that the number of times or amount of time a 
10	  
person has engaged in an everyday activity like...playing tennis...is not closely related 
11	  
to one’s level of objective performance (Ericsson & Towne, 2013, p.887).   
12	  
A similar critique applies to providing detail of the athletes’ competitive experience 
13	  
without providing any indication of the standard of this competition (reported by five 
14	  
studies); and training time/frequency which provides an indication of the athlete’s investment 
15	  
in their sport but also does not provide any indication of performance level either. 
16	  
Additionally, some performance-based definitions are questionable, for example semi-
17	  
professional soccer players (Roca et al, 2012), and amateur golfers with handicaps ranging 
18	  
from -2 to 10. That is, some players averaged ten shots over par every time they play 
19	  
(Beilock & Gray, 2012). It can be confidently argued that such golfers are not elite. Finally, 
20	  
although the athlete’s team may perform at a high level, this does not guarantee that all 
21	  
players will be at a similar standard. For example, in a sample of NCAA Division 1 athletes 
22	  
“two pitchers were used intermittently in the rotation, and one was a backup fielder that saw 
23	  
limited playing time” (Ciana & Sheldon, 2010, p. 129).  
24

----- Page 22 (native) -----
21  
Competitiveness of the domain. As Ericsson and Towne (2013) suggested, “there 
1	  
are general characteristics...that mediate performance...depending on the competitiveness of 
2	  
the domain” (p.890). Furthermore, Storm et al (2012) noted differences in opportunities for 
3	  
athletes to progress to highest levels, depending on their sport. These ideas allude to issues 
4	  
when comparing athletes between sports, which is of particular relevance when studies use 
5	  
multi-sport samples. Indeed, dictionary definitions of the terms elite and expert refer to, for 
6	  
example, “a small group of people within a larger group who have more...talent than the rest 
7	  
of the group” (Encarta Dictionary). When defining elite or expert individuals, some 
8	  
comparison must be made with the rest of the population. For athletes, there are two main 
9	  
populations to which such comparisons are important: (i) the other athletes in that sport 
10	  
within their country; and (ii) the other athletes within that sport globally. These factors also 
11	  
have implications for the athletes’ status as elite/expert, and the meaningfulness of these 
12	  
definitions. 
13	  
 
Competition in the sport within the athlete’s country. First, the relative status of an 
14	  
elite athlete could be judged by the pool of competition within their country, and the number 
15	  
of athletes they needed to compete against in order to reach national/international level. This 
16	  
comparison depends on the size of the country and the popularity of the sport within that 
17	  
country. For example, athletes from a country that has a prominent status in the sport (e.g., it 
18	  
is the national sport, such as soccer in Brazil) are likely to have faced much greater 
19	  
competition to reach the highest level, and are therefore likely to display an extremely high 
20	  
standard of performance. Alternatively, the sport may not be popular within that country, or 
21	  
the country may be a small sporting nation, so athletes are not likely to have developed 
22	  
comparable performance standards in order to reach the international level. As an extreme 
23	  
illustration, the swimmer Michael Phelps represented his country at the Olympic Games, as 
24	  
did ‘Eric the Eel’ from Equatorial Guinea! 
25

----- Page 23 (native) -----
22  
Competition within the sport globally. Second, the relative status of an athlete could 
1	  
be judged by the global pool of competition within the sport that they are involved in, and the 
2	  
number of athletes they need to compete against in order to be considered the best in that 
3	  
sport. Regardless of the countries involved, this comparison depends on the global popularity 
4	  
of that sport and, consequently, competition structure and talent development systems. Highly 
5	  
developed, globally recognised sports with high participation rates in many different 
6	  
countries must be differentiated from sports that are less developed where only a small 
7	  
number of countries demonstrate high participation rates (or even no high participation rates 
8	  
in any country). To illustrate, extreme cases within the studies reviewed include soccer, 
9	  
basketball or swimming compared to roller-hockey, artistic roller-skating, and bowls.  
10	  
Summary. The findings of this study are synthesised in Figure 1. Because of the wide 
11	  
range of studies and sports included, this could also be proposed as a model or heuristic 
12	  
device for classifying expert samples in sport. In turn, this could help researchers to define 
13	  
their samples along a continuum of ‘eliteness’ or expertise, in order to be transparent in their 
14	  
definitions, to encourage consistency within this field, and to improve understanding of 
15	  
expertise in sport.  
16	  
[INSERT FIGURE 1 NEAR HERE] 
17	  
To judge within the sport, definitions should be based on the athletes’ highest 
18	  
standard of performance, their success at that level, and the amount of experience that they 
19	  
have gained at that level. To compare athletes across sports, it is vital that the 
20	  
competitiveness of the sport within the specific country, and within the sport itself, should 
21	  
both be considered. To capture these ideas, the following equation2 and classification system 
22	  
is proposed: 
23	  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
2	  Because of our argument that experience is not as strong an indicator of expertise as 
performance standard or success, its value in this equation is halved.

12-16 = world-class elite 
3	  
Here, semi-elite athletes are those whose highest level of participation is below the top 
4	  
standard possible in their sport (e.g., in talent-development programs, competing at second-
5	  
tier standard or below, etc.). Competitive-elite athletes regularly compete at the highest level 
6	  
in their sport (e.g., top divisions/leagues, or competing in the Olympic Games etc.) but have 
7	  
not had any success at that level. Successful-elite athletes not only compete at the highest 
8	  
level, but have experienced some (infrequent) success at that standard (e.g., winning an event 
9	  
or a medal). World-class elite athletes experience sustained success at the highest level, with 
10	  
repeated wins over a prolonged period of time (e.g., winning gold medals in consecutive 
11	  
Olympics, or major competitive victories over a number of seasons).  
12	  
In comparison to previous definitions, this taxonomy appears to be more specific and 
13	  
potentially more useful in sport than those advocated previously. The Cambridge Handbook 
14	  
of Expertise and Expert Performance discusses dictionary definitions of experts (Ericsson, 
15	  
2006, p.3-4), and “broad issues on attaining expert performance that generalise across 
16	  
different domains of expertise” (p.10) – however these are not specific to sport, and do not 
17	  
denote between the various ‘levels’ of expertise in this domain. Chi (2006) also included a 
18	  
proficiency scale ranging from novice to master (p.22), and although it does include various 
19	  
levels, this is not specific to sport (e.g., the highest level of proficiency – a master – is not 
20	  
applicable in sport as the ultimate goal is not to become a coach). Hodges, Starkes and 
21	  
MacMahon (2006), in a chapter devoted specifically to expert performance in sport, 
22	  
reinforced that: “It is very important in sport research to be specific and define the level of 
23	  
expertise/performance one is studying, both in terms of years of experience and also in level 
24	  
of competition and performance attained” (p.482) – but they did not define what those levels 
25

----- Page 25 (native) -----
24  
are or could be. More recently, Gulbin and Weissensteiner (2013, p.56-58) discussed the 
1	  
FTEM (Foundations, Talent, Elite, Mastery) framework to guide the planning, review, and 
2	  
development of expertise pathways/systems. This framework identifies seven stages of sport 
3	  
excellence, including breakthrough and reward (e.g., national age-group representation), 
4	  
representation at senior national level, success in peak international competitions, and 
5	  
sustained success at the highest level. While these stages are more specific, the FTEM 
6	  
framework does not appear to account for between-sport comparisons (i.e., competitiveness 
7	  
of that sport in the athlete’s country or globally), or the amount of experience the athlete has 
8	  
had at that level. Therefore, the taxonomy proposed in this review appears to be more 
9	  
comprehensive, specific, and practically useful than others available.   
10	  
Justifying Samples and Generating Insights – a Kuhnian Perspective 
11	  
 
Puzzle-solving with experts. As noted in Table 3, the most common rationale 
12	  
underlying selection of the sample (just less than half of the papers) was exploratory. It was 
13	  
alarming, therefore, that just 10% of the papers in this category generated novel and general 
14	  
theoretical conclusions about expertise, a reasonable expectation for studies claiming that 
15	  
‘little is known about’ the phenomena they address. One way of interpreting this finding is to 
16	  
reflect on Thomas Kuhn’s vision of scientific activity as ‘puzzle-solving’: the minute 
17	  
piecemeal extension of the reach of existing theories (or paradigms) by applying them in 
18	  
slightly different situations (Kuhn, 1996), such as exploring the goal-setting patterns of 
19	  
prospective Olympic athletes (Burton et al, 2010). This type of activity, though quite 
20	  
‘normal’ according to Kuhn, is not to be confused with the genuine goal of science, which in 
21	  
this instance is to challenge, and therefore advance, our understanding of the cognitive or 
22	  
psychological basis of expertise in sport (Popper, 1959). To this extent, the scientific merit of 
23	  
the exploratory papers can reasonably be questioned. 
24

----- Page 26 (native) -----
25  
The lack of an adequate nature/nurture debate. Although the papers drawing on 
1	  
the superior rationale were more successful in advancing our understanding of expertise in 
2	  
general (13 of the 32 studies), none engaged in the nature/nurture debate with respect to the 
3	  
source of expertise. 17 papers in this category made explicit claims about the causal 
4	  
relationship between ‘deliberate practice’ and expertise, whilst only five stated similar 
5	  
hypotheses with respect to genetic traits or cognitive structures. The other 10 papers in this 
6	  
category, though agreeing that experts posessess superior cognitive functioning, failed to 
7	  
offer an explanation as to the cause of this assumed superiority.  
8	  
Although the role of deliberate practice in shaping expertise is undeniable, the issue of 
9	  
whether it is both necessary and sufficient for expertise is a more important (and debatable) 
10	  
question. For example, Tucker and Collins (2012) argued that “deliberate practice alone fails 
11	  
to account for the wide range of individual performance levels and responses to training 
12	  
observed in sport” (p. 556) and that expertise is not a simple outcome of accumulated hours 
13	  
of deliberate practice. Researchers have also concluded that we know little about the role of 
14	  
genetic differences in the acquisition of expertise (Campitelli & Gobet, 2011; Baker & 
15	  
Young, in press). Thus, we suggest that, if our knowledge about expertise is to be advanced, 
16	  
it is necessary for researchers to explain, in the first instance, how they believe expertise is 
17	  
developed. And, although it is admittedly difficult to pinpoint the necessary and sufficient 
18	  
conditions for the development of expertise (Moran, 2012), it is certainly a task worth 
19	  
undertaking. The lack of adequate debate in the recent literature therefore remains a serious 
20	  
oversight, especially given the importance of this debate for both talent identification and 
21	  
coaching. 
22	  
Experts as idiosyncratic and dysfunctional? The studies that sampled experts based 
23	  
on necessity (e.g., Storm et al, 2012; Toner & Moran, 2011) often did so as a means to 
24	  
increase understanding of dysfunctional psychological behaviour in elite athletes. Whilst this 
25

----- Page 27 (native) -----
26  
may be of little general interest to expertise researchers, it raises an interesting question for 
1	  
researchers who assume – at least implicitly – that experts are somehow superior, 
2	  
psychologically, to mere mortals (i.e., 32 of the papers in our sample). It has been suggested, 
3	  
for example, that elite sports men and women tend to ‘overconform’ to traditional sporting 
4	  
norms such as ‘win at all costs’, taking risks and ‘playing through the pain’, the single-
5	  
minded dedication to a goal, and systematic bodily improvement, leading to dysfunctional or 
6	  
deviant behaviour (Hughes & Coakley, 2001). Overconforming to ‘win at all costs’, for 
7	  
example, may lead to doping (e.g., Lentillon-Kaestner et al, 2012). Similarly, taking risks and 
8	  
‘playing through the pain’ may lead to injury and depression (e.g., Demulier et al., 2013); 
9	  
whilst striving for systematic bodily improvement can lead to eating disorders (e.g., Scoffier 
10	  
et al, 2012). It appears, then, that in addition to possessing almost super-human physical and 
11	  
cognitive expertise – abilities that are well worthy of study – experts are often rather 
12	  
idiosyncratic in their choice of psychological strategies in competitive settings and may be 
13	  
vulnerable to mental health issues. For example, the boundaries between athletes’ pre-
14	  
performance routines, superstitious beliefs and apparently obsessive-compulsive behaviour 
15	  
are frequently blurred.  
16	  
More generally, there has been an upsurge of research interest in psychopathology 
17	  
among athletes (e.g., see Brewer & Petrie, 2014) – especially elite performers. Interestingly, 
18	  
epidemiological studies in this field have shown that certain kinds of psychopathology (e.g., 
19	  
eating disorders, depression) are more prevalent among elite athletes than in the general 
20	  
population or among less proficient performers. For example, prevalence rates for eating 
21	  
disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa may be higher among collegiate and 
22	  
international elite athletes than in the general population (Brewer & Petrie, 2014). These 
23	  
problems are especially apparent in sports (e.g., gymnastics) in which weight and body size 
24	  
and shape are important. Similarly, Hammond et al. (2013) discovered that the prevalence of 
25

----- Page 28 (native) -----
27  
depression among their sample of elite athletes (i.e., collegiate swimmers who were 
1	  
competing to represent Canada internationally) was higher than had been reported previously 
2	  
in the research literature. In particular, these authors reported that the prevalence of 
3	  
depression doubled among the top 25% of elite swimmers in their sample – especially after 
4	  
perceived performance failure. Clearly, elite athletes are far from the paragons of physical 
5	  
and mental health that they are often assumed to be. This state of affairs may be a 
6	  
consequence of the fact that elite athletes have to engage in prolonged and intensive training 
7	  
from an early age, often leaving their families at critically sensitive developmental stages in 
8	  
their lives (Bär & Markser, 2013). In short, we should not assume that the practices of experts 
9	  
are to be imitated. 
10	  
 Strengths and Limitations 
11	  
 
We believe that the present systematic review has four main strengths. Firstly, it is 
12	  
based on rigorous selection criteria (see details in “Method” section) which enabled us to 
13	  
capture a broad range of recent empirical studies of expertise. Thus, reflecting the 
14	  
interdisciplinary nature of this field, we reviewed journal papers on expertise that were 
15	  
published not only in sport psychology but also in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and in 
16	  
other relevant fields (e.g., motor learning) . Secondly, in exploring the question of how to 
17	  
define the construct of expertise, we addressed a crucial but unresolved issue in this field. 
18	  
Surprisingly, whereas many reviews (e.g., Williams & Ford, 2008) have examined research 
19	  
findings on expert-novice diferences in sport, there has been no evaluation to date of the 
20	  
adequacy of the operational definitions of expertise in the relevant research literature. 
21	  
Without clear agreement about how to define and/or classify expertise objectively in sport, 
22	  
the future of the field is bleak because a question mark hangs over the validity and 
23	  
generalizability of research findings on expert-novice differences. Thirdly, our review has led 
24	  
us to postulate a classification system which distinguishes between four types of elite 
25

----- Page 29 (native) -----
28  
performer – semi-elite, competitive-elite, successful-elite, and world-class elite athletes (see 
1	  
earlier for details). This classification system is not intended to be definitive – but merely an 
2	  
heuristic device to encourage expertise researchers to think carefully before selecting their 
3	  
samples. Finally, in questioning prevailing assumptions about the meaning of expertise, we 
4	  
also questioned certain assumed characteristics (e.g., invulnerability to mental health issues) 
5	  
of expert athletes.  
6	  
Balanced against these strengths, however, we acknowledge several limitations of our 
7	  
paper as follows. To begin with, although our aim was to evaluate the most recent (since 
8	  
2010) research on expertise, we had to exclude a large number of studies because they had 
9	  
used different definitions of expertise from those that we employed (e.g., “skilled” and 
10	  
“unskilled”). Secondly, we were forced to reject from consideration some studies that had 
11	  
sampled athletes who were obviously at the elite level (e.g., World or Olympic champions), 
12	  
but who were not explicitly defined as “elite” or “expert” in the title or abstract of the relevant 
13	  
journal paper. Thirdly, our taxonomy of expertise is based only on the data from the included 
14	  
studies - so it needs to be refined by future empirical investigations. A related limitation is 
15	  
that, at present, our taxonomy does not easily enable classification of multi-sport samples 
16	  
which is one immediate avenue for future research.  
17	  
Conclusion 
18	  
 
As expertise research is an imposing edifice with many different rooms, it is all too 
19	  
easy to forget that its foundations need to be checked from time to time. In conducting this 
20	  
systematic review of the operational definition of “expertise”, we seek to open, not close, 
21	  
scientific debate. So, the framework postulated in Figure 1 is intended as a modest proposal 
22	  
or ‘tentative solution’ (Popper, 1959) to the problem of how to select a valid sample of 
23	  
experts for future research. In a bid to test this bold conjecture, we invite empirical 
24	  
refinement from future scholars in the hope that we can move towards a valid and reliable 
25

----- Page 30 (native) -----
29  
method of sampling athletes for research that is most likely to advance our theoretical 
1	  
understanding of the phenomenon of expertise in sport. Such research, as we have shown, 
2	  
will also have greater explanatory power if researchers are able to offer and then test specific 
3	  
hypotheses about the sources of expertise - whether genetic or the result of specific modes, 
4	  
frequencies and intensities of deliberate practice.

(15.38%) 
Farrow et al (2010) 
Exploratory 
Normally begin with the classic refrain: 
“little is known about…” then explain that a 
well-understood psychological phenomena 
needs to be explored with elite or expert 
athletes. There is an assumption that experts 
are likely to display markedly different 
psychological traits or practices compared to 
novices, and that novices can learn 
something from experts. 
29 
(31.86%) 
Bruce et al (2013); 
Jowett & Spray (2013); 
Macquet et al (2012) 
Necessity 
The nature of the question dictates that elite 
performers are sampled. This is often the 
case where the phenomenon (doping, 
career-threatening injury, retirement from 
sport career) may only apply to elite 
performers. 
20 
(21.97%) 
Storm et al (2012); 
Toner & Moran (2011) 
Training 
These studies specifically aim to test 
hypotheses that experts will perform better 
at certain cognitive and motor tasks due to 
extended and superior training (or 
‘deliberate practice’). 
17 
(18.68%) 
Babiloni et al (2010); 
Gorman et al (2012);

(2012); Moreau et al

(2012); Wei & Luo 
(2010); Wei et al (2011) 
Brain 
These studies specifically aim to test 
hypotheses that experts will perform better 
at certain cognitive and motor tasks due to 
the possession of traits that are inherited or 
developed outside of training.

et al (2013) 
Superior 
Unexplained 
Experts are assumed to function at a higher 
cognitive or psychological level but there is 
no explanation as to why this may be the 
case.
