ABSTRACT
Receptor tyrosine kinases Flt-1 and Flk-1y
KDR, and their ligand, the vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), were shown to be essential for angiogenesis in the
mouse embryo by gene targeting. Flk-1yKDR null mutant
mice exhibited impaired endothelial and hematopoietic cell
development. On the other hand, Flt-1 null mutation resulted
in early embryonic death at embryonic day 8.5, showing
disorganization of blood vessels, such as overgrowth of endo-
thelial cells. Flt-1 differs from Flk-1 in that it displays a higher
affinity for VEGF but lower kinase activity, suggesting the
importance of its extracellular domain. To examine the bio-
logical role of Flt-1 in embryonic development and vascular
formation, we deleted the kinase domain without affecting the
ligand binding region. Flt-1 tyrosine kinase-deficient homozy-
gous mice (flt-1TK2/2) developed normal vessels and survived.
However, VEGF-induced macrophage migration was strongly
suppressed in flt-1TK2/2 mice. These results indicate that Flt-1
without tyrosine kinase domain is sufficient to allow embry-
onic development with normal angiogenesis, and that a re-
ceptor tyrosine kinase plays a main biological role as a
ligand-binding molecule.
Angiogenesis is an essential process in normal embryonic
development and is closely involved in a variety of diseases
such as diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, and tumor
growth in vivo (1). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
and its receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1yKDR, recently have been
shown to be a very important regulator system for normal and
pathological angiogenesis (2–8). Flt-1, as well as Flk-1yKDR,
belongs to the tyrosine kinase family and has seven Ig-like
domains in the extracellular domain, a transmembrane do-
main, and a tyrosine kinase domain with a long kinase insert
(9–11). Although the structure of VEGF receptor family is
related to that of the five-Ig type receptor family, which
includes FmsyKityplatelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) re-
ceptors, the signal transduction pathways in these families are
suggested to be different because of the difference of signaling
motif on the intracellular domains. FmsyKityPDGF receptors
conserve the Tyr-X-X-Met motif in the kinase insert region
and use a signal transduction pathway through phosphatidyl-
inositol 3 kinase (PI3 kinase) (12, 13). On the other hand, Flt-1
and Flk-1yKDR lack this motif in the kinase insert region, and
the tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3 kinase p85 subunit and the
activation of PI3 kinase are very low, or nonexistent, in primary
endothelial cells as well as in the Flt-1 or Flk-1yKDR-
overexpressed NIH 3T3 cells after stimulation with VEGF (14,
15).
VEGF receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1yKDR, are in most cases
specifically expressed on vascular endothelial cells (16–20),
and as an exception, only the Flt-1 is expressed on monocytesy
macrophages (21, 22). These two VEGF receptors are struc-
turally highly homologous; however, their biochemical features
are quite distinct. Flt-1 shows at least a 10-fold higher affinity
to VEGF even in the soluble form of only the extracellular
domain but about a 10-fold lower kinase activity than Flk-1y
KDR (2–4, 23, 24). Furthermore, Flt-1 overexpressed in NIH
3T3 or bovine endothelial cells did not induce cell proliferation
in the presence of VEGF (23, 25), whereas Flk-1yKDR
overexpressed in the above two types of cells showed cell
growth after stimulation with VEGF (26). PlGF, which binds
Flt-1 but not Flk-1yKDR, gives very weak, if any, biological
activities such as endothelial cell growth-stimulatory activity
and vascular permeability activity in most assay conditions (24,
27). These results strongly suggest that the biological functions
of these receptors are different or independent from each
other in the angiogenic processes in vivo. However, the dif-
ferences between the two receptors and particularly the func-
tion of the Flt-1 in vivo remain to be clarified.
Recently, gene targeting studies were carried out on flt-1 and
flk-1yKDR genes in mice (7, 8). The flk-1yKDR2/2 homozy-
gous mice showed a severe deficiency in vascular formation in
association with hematopoietic impairment resulting in death
at embryonic day (E) 8.5 (7). On the other hand, the flt-12/2
homozygotes showed a disorganization of blood vessels, par-
ticularly an overgrowth of endothelial-like abnormal cells
within vascular lumens and died at E8.5 to E9.0 (8). Thus,
Flk-1yKDR is considered to be a positive regulator for the
commitment and proliferation of endothelial cells, whereas the
flt-1 gene appears to be a negative regulator for proliferation
of endothelial cells. This genetic study together with the
biochemical characteristics of Flt-1 described above raises the
possibility that the Flt-1 molecule functions as a trapping
protein for VEGF to negatively regulate the levels of VEGF
around the endothelial cells in embryogenesis, not as a strong
signal transducer such as classical receptor tyrosine kinases.
To examine this possibility, we carried out a partial gene
targeting study on the flt-1 gene in which the flt-1 tyrosine
kinase domain was deleted and the exon encoding the 39-
juxtamembrane region and the amino terminal part of the
tyrosine kinase domain was replaced with a neomycin (neo)-
resistant gene cassette. The exon encoding the transmembrane
domain remained without mutation, and thus, the truncated
Flt-1 was expected to be localized on cell surface as a mem-
brane protein. Here we report that the tyrosine kinase-
negative flt-1 gene is sufficient for embryonic angiogenesis and
rescues the lethality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

exons 17–19 (nucleotides 2411–2705) was used as a probe to
isolate a 24-kb mouse flt-1 DNA clone from a genomic library

of the 129Sv strain (Stratagene). The targeting vector contains
a neo cassette (pPGKneopA) and the diphtheria toxin A gene
(pMC1 DT-A) (28).
Embryonic Stem (ES) Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, and
Mice. J1 ES cells (29) were transfected by electroporation with
targeting vector DNA (Fig. 1A), linearized by NotI, and then
selected with drug applications (175 mgyml of G418). EcoRI-
digested DNA prepared from the resulting ES clones was
screened by Southern blot analysis by using the 0.7-kb SpeI–
HindIII genomic DNA fragment as a probe. To further
confirm the construct obtained, Southern blot analysis was
performed with other restriction enzymes (SalI and ApaI) by

using exon 18 cDNA as a probe. ES cell clones containing the
targeted gene were injected into C57B6yJ blastocysts, and the
male chimeric mice obtained were crossed with female
C57B6yJ mice to yield mice heterozygous for the flt-1TK
mutation. The genotypes of the pups obtained by crosses
between flt-1TK1/2 mice were determined by Southern blot
analysis andyor PCR analysis. The forward primer was AC-
CCTCTGTACCTGGTCAATTGATGCAAAG. The reverse
primer was TGCAAACTCCCACTTGCTGGCATCATAG.
The reverse neo primer was GCTAAAGCGCATGCTCCA-
GACTGCCTTG. Two lines of mutant mice were established
from the ES cell clones.
Preparation of Proteins. Lung tissues derived from each of
10 wild-type or flt-1TK2/2 homozygous mice were lysed in an
ice-cold buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes at pH
7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2%
aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),
and applied to a 1-ml HiTrap Heparin Affinity Column
(Pharmacia). Proteins bound were eluted with a series of
buffers from 0.6 to 0.9 M NaCl containing 50 mM Hepes at pH
7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2%
aprotinin, and 1 mM PMSF. The fractionated samples were
analyzed by SDSyPAGE and Western blotting.
Immunohistochemistry. Tissue sections were immunohisto-
chemically stained with an antiserum against human von
Willebrand factor (vWF) (Dako) as an endothelial cell specific
marker. Tissue sections (6 mm thick) were fixed with acetone
at 220°C for 5 min and rehydrated in PBS. For inhibition of
endogenous peroxidase, sections were incubated in 0.1% H2O2
methanol solution for 15 min at room temperature and washed
three times with PBS. Nonspecific binding of antibody was
blocked by incubation with 10% normal goat serum-
containing PBS for 30 min. Subsequently, sections were incu-
bated with primary antibody against vWF for 1 hr, washed
three times with PBS, incubated with biotinylated goat anti-
rabbit Ig G (Vector), washed again with PBS, and then
incubated with an ABC kit (Vector). After washing in PBS,
vWF was detected by 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole (Vector).
Culture of Primary Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells Obtained
from Mouse Liver. Sinusoidal endothelial cells were isolated
from a mouse liver as previously described (20). These cells
were grown in endothel basal medium (Kurabou, Osaka,
Japan) with 0.5% fetal calf serum supplemented with or
without 100 ngyml of mouse recombinant VEGF (R&D
Systems). After the cells were cultured in 96 wells of rat
collagen I-coated plates for 4 days, MTS solution (Owen’s
reagent; Becton Dickinson) was added and the absorbance at
490 nm was recorded by using a 96-well plate reader for the cell
proliferation assay. A similar culture divided into 24 wells was
fixed in 10% formaldehyde and stained with Crystal Violet for
the detection of morphological changes.
Permeability Assay in Vivo. About 5 min after the injection
of 0.1% Evans Blue dye (400 ml) into mouse tail vein, 2 ml of
1% BSA-containing PBS with or without mouse VEGF (100
ngyml) was injected to the peritoneal cavity. After 1 hr, 0.5 ml
of peritoneal fluid was recovered. The samples were centri-
fuged to remove the cells, and the absorbance at 605 nm of
these samples was monitored to measure the amount of dye
released.
Migration Assay. Three days after the i.p. injection of 1%
glycogen (2 ml), mouse peritoneal macrophages were har-
vested by peritoneal lavage by using 10 ml of sterile PBS.
Lavage fluids were centrifuged at 200 3 g for 5 min. The cells
were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium and diluted to 2 3
106 cellsyml. Cell suspensions with a viability of more than 95%
as assayed by Trypan Blue, Wright-Giemsa staining, and
anti-CD11b antibody staining were used for experiments.
Cell migration was evaluated by using a chemotaxis Boyden
chamber. Chemoattractant (VEGF or Zymosan-activated se-
rum; ref. 30) in RPMI 1640 medium was added to the lower
wells of the chamber, and 50 ml of cell suspension per well (105
cells) was seeded in the upper wells. The upper and lower wells
were separated by a 5-mm pore size polyvinylpyrrolidone-free
polycarbonate filter. The chamber was incubated at 37°C with
5% CO2 for 3 hr and 15 min. After incubation, filters were fixed
and stained with Diff-Quik, and 10 high-power fields were
counted for the migration assay. For examination, 4–5 8-week-
old flt-1TK1/1 and flt-1TK2/2 mice of the same litter from two
independent lines were used. MTS and migration assays were
performed in triplicate.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A Partial Gene Targeting for Disruption of flt-1 Tyrosine
Kinase Domain in Mice. To make a targeting vector suitable
for the construction of a tyrosine kinase-deficient flt-1 gene, we
first examined the entire exon-intron structure of the flt-1 gene
in mice and found that exon 17 encodes the amino terminal
region of Flt-1 tyrosine kinase domain, amino acid residues
787–830 (31). This flt-1 exon 17 was replaced with a neo gene
cassette, which carries its own promoter and polyadenylation
signal (Fig. 1A). A rare possibility of an alternative splicing
without neo gene to exon 18 causes an out-of-frame mutation.
Chimeric male mice generated from injections with two dif-
ferent targeted ES cell lines transmitted this mutation through
their germ line.
No Marked Abnormality of Blood Vessels in flt-1TK2/2 Mice
that Express a Truncated Flt-1 Receptor. When we crossed
flt-1TK1/2 heterozygous mice and genotyped the litters of the
newborns, Southern blot and PCR analyses (Fig. 1 B and C)
revealed the presence of flt-1TK2/2 homozygotes. As expected,
the flt-1TK1/2 heterozygotes expressed a lower level of the 7-kb,
full-length flt-1 mRNA (Fig. 1D, Upper), and the flt-1TK2/2
homozygotes had completely lost this 7-kb mRNA. On the
other hand, both flt-1TK1/2 and flt-1TK2/2 mice expressed an
artificial flt-1 mRNA of about 3 kb, which carries only the 59
half of the flt-1 gene (Fig. 1D, Lower). This short flt-1 message
did not contain the neo sequence, suggesting that these flt-1
mRNAs arose as a result of termination within intron 16. The
neo message was detected to be 1 kb in size and was transcribed
from its own promoter (Fig. 1D, Right).
To examine for Flt-1 proteins, lung tissues from wild-type
and homozygous mice were lysed in buffer and partially
purified by heparin affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig.
1E (Upper), wild-type mice contained both the 190-kDa,
full-length molecule and the 110-kDa endogenous soluble
form of Flt-1, which carries about 85% of the extracellular
domain. This truncated form of flt-1 results from a termination
within intron 13 associated with 31 amino acids derived from
the 59 sequence of this intron (31, 32). On the other hand, the
flt-1TK2/2 homozygotes had lost the full-length Flt-1, although
the endogenous, soluble form of Flt-1 was expressed at a level
almost equal to that of wild-type mice. Furthermore, flt-1TK2/2
homozygotes expressed a truncated form of Flt-1 with a size of
approximately 120 kDa. This form was detected by using
antiserum raised against a 10-aa sequence, KLKRVRKQKI,
the latter six amino acids of which are derived from read-
through of intron 16 (Fig. 1E, Lower). Therefore, flt-1TK2/2
homozygotes expressed both the novel truncated form of Flt-1,
which lacks the cytoplasmic region, and soluble Flt-1, but not
the full-length Flt-1 tyrosine kinase.
Homozygous (flt-1TK2/2) mice survived and were essentially
normal with respect to fertility. Genotyping of offspring
obtained from a cross between heterozygotes gave a ratio of
almost 1:2:1 (80:166:77 from a total of 323 F2 mice) for
wild-type, flt-1TK1/2 heterozygous, and flt-1TK2/2 homozygous
mice, respectively. This finding indicates that the loss of the
tyrosine kinase domain in Flt-1 did not strongly disadvantage
the second generation.

Histologically, there were no marked differences in the
blood vessels between flt-1TK2/2 homozygous embryos and
adult mice when using hematoxylin-eosin and anti-von Wille-
brand factor antibody staining (Fig. 2 A–H).
Endothelial Cell Growth and Vascular Permeability of
flt-1TK2/2 Mice in Response to VEGF. VEGF plays the dual
role of a growth factor and a vascular permeability factor for
endothelial cells and vessels (2–4). As Flt-1 is a key element in
the mediation of VEGF responses, we investigated whether
VEGF still elicits the above effects in the flt-1TK2/2 mutant
background. In Figs. 2 I and J and 3A, we show that the
mitogenic and morphological responses induced by VEGF in
the sinusoidal endothelial cells derived from the liver of
flt-1TK2/2 mice were not significantly affected. To examine
vascular permeability in vivo, we established an assay system.
After an injection of dye into the tail vein of the mouse, VEGF
was immediately injected into the intraperitoneal cavity, and 1
hr later, the amount of dye permeating through the peritoneal
blood vessels into the abdominal cavity was measured. Almost
equal levels of permeability were observed for both the
wild-type and flt-1TK2/2 mice (Fig. 3B). The VEGF-related
ligand, PlGF (33), which binds only to Flt-1 and not to
Flk-1yKDR (24, 27, 34–36), induced very low levels of per-
meability in both wild-type and flt-1TK2/2 mice (not shown).
This finding may indicate that the rapid response of blood
vessels to VEGF-induced permeability is mostly related to
Flk-1yKDR.
Suppression of VEGF-Dependent Macrophage Migration in
flt-1TK2/2 Mice. The whole structure of the flt-1 gene is highly
conserved among mammalian species (9, 20, 37). Recently, the
flt-1 gene, but not the flk-1yKDR gene, was found to be well
expressed in human peripheral monocytes and to play an
important role in VEGF-dependent cell migration (21, 22).
Thus, we examined whether or not the tyrosine kinase of Flt-1
is dispensable for this function of Flt-1. The wild-type, flt-
1TK1/2 heterozygous, and flt-1TK2/2 homozygous mice macro-
phages in the abdominal cavity were used for the cell migration
assay. Only the macrophages, and not the lymphocytes, ex-
pressed flt-1 mRNA as detected by reverse transcription–PCR
(Fig. 4A). The macrophages from wild-type mice had the
full-length flt-1 mRNA, whereas those from flt-1TK2/2 homozy-
gotes carried the truncated form of flt-1.
As shown in Fig. 4B, VEGF-induced macrophage migration
was markedly decreased to almost an undetectable level in
flt-1TK2/2 homozygotes, although these macrophages re-
sponded well to the general migration inducer, Zymosan-
activated serum (30), irrespective of whether they carried the
full-length or truncated form of Flt-1. PlGF gave essentially the
same results (Fig. 4B). These observations indicate that the
Flt-1 tyrosine kinase domain is required for its secondary
physiological function, namely, the induction of monocytey
macrophage migration in the presence of VEGF.

No detectable abnormalities in the endothelial cells and
blood vessels in vivo and in vitro of flt-1TK2/2 mice. Wild-type (A, C,

homozygous mice. (A) Growth stimulatory activity of 100 ngyml of
mouse VEGF on primary sinusoidal endothelial cells derived from
wild-type and flt-1TK2/2 mice by using the MTS assay. The assay was
performed in triplicate for one mouse, and four or five mice for each
type were used. The relative mean absorbances at 490 nm after
stimulation with VEGF were shown in comparison with the mean
absorbances without VEGF as control (100%). The average value for
wild-type mice without VEGF was 0.31 OD490, and that for flt-1TK2/2
homozygous mice was 0.45 OD490. This slight difference in the basal
levels of two types of mice appears mostly because of the technical
difficulty for the preparation of mouse liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells. (B) VEGF-dependent increase in vascular permeability of

Possible Models for the Biological Function of Tyrosine
Kinase-Deficient Flt-1 in Mice. Thus, we conclude that the
tyrosine kinase activity of Flt-1 is dispensable for embryonic
angiogenesis but necessary for macrophage migration medi-
ated by VEGF. As previously reported, the flt-1 null mutant
mice were embryonic lethal because of abnormal overgrowth
of endothelial cells (8), suggesting a negative regulatory func-
tion of Flt-1 in VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Consistent with
this finding, we and others already had shown that Flt-1 has a
greater (more than 10-fold) affinity for VEGF than Flk-1y
KDR but only a very weak tyrosine kinase activity, and that the
extracellular domain of Flt-1 has a potent suppressor activity
on VEGF both in vivo and in vitro (23, 24, 27, 32–36).
Therefore, a reasonable explanation for the rescue of an-
giogenesis with the kinase-deficient Flt-1 shown here is that the
extracellular domain of Flt-1 is necessary and sufficient to
absorb a significant amount of VEGF in vivo, resulting in a
negative regulation of endothelial growth in embryonic an-
giogenesis.
Another possibility is that the kinase-deficient Flt-1 still
binds to some unidentified negative-signal transducer, which
also might function under normal conditions with wild-type
Flt-1. However, this model seems unlikely because only 11
amino acid residues, RKLKRVRKQKI, are left downstream
of the transmembrane domain of the truncated Flt-1 derived
from exon 16 and intron 16.
In general, receptor tyrosine kinases are believed to exert
their function through activation and inactivation of their
kinase activity (38, 39). Among gene targeting studies, the
deletion of tyrosine kinase domain of receptors such as c-met
and MuSK resulted in inactivation of their biological activities
and embryonic or perinatal death (40, 41). There are a few
cases in which the null mutant mice survived, and some
phenotypic differences were observed between null mutant
and tyrosine kinase-deficient mutant mice. For example, the
extent of reduction of the sensory ganglia in the trkC null
mutant mice was more severe than that in the truncated,
kinase-negative trkC mutant mice (42, 43).
In addition, in the case of the Nuk receptor gene, which is
a member of the eph tyrosine kinase family, a mutant without
the tyrosine kinase domain prevented nonlethal abnormality
in the central nervous system of Nuk null mutant mice (44).
The results described here for the Flt-1 receptor (VEGFR-1)
demonstrate a tyrosine kinase receptor without the active
participation of its tyrosine kinase domain to overcome a lethal
abnormality.

Loss of VEGF- and PlGF-dependent macrophage migra-
tion in flt-1TK2/2 homozygous mice. (A) Reverse transcription–PCR
used for the detection of flt-1 mRNA in mouse macrophages. Primers:
#9F (exon 9 forward primer) and #11R (exon 11 reverse primer) for
the extracellular domain (Top), #17F (exon 17 forward primer) and
#18R (exon 18 reverse primer) for kinase domain (Middle), and mouse
b actin primers (Bottom). (B) VEGF165 or PlGF-2 at different
concentrations, as well as Zymosan-activated serum (ZAS), were
added to the lower chamber of the Boyden chamber apparatus. The
results are mean percentages (6SD) of migrated cells in 10 high-power
fields. For each experiment, 4–5 wild-type or flt-1TK2/2 homozygous
mice were used, and each experiment was carried out in triplicate. The
mean numbers of migrated macrophages without chemoattractant
were shown as 100 and compared with those with chemoattractants.
(The real mean numbers of migrated macrophages without chemoat-
tractant were 120 in the wild-type and 112 in the flt-1TK2/2 homozy-
gous mice.)
