Mutual trophic interactions between contiguous habitats have
remained poorly understood despite their potential signiﬁcance
for community maintenance in ecological landscapes. In a decidu-
ous forest and stream ecotone, aquatic insect emergence peaked
around spring, when terrestrial invertebrate biomass was low. In
contrast, terrestrial invertebrate input to the stream occurred
primarily during summer, when aquatic invertebrate biomass was
nearly at its lowest. Such reciprocal, across-habitat prey ﬂux
alternately subsidized both forest birds and stream ﬁshes, account-
ing for 25.6% and 44.0% of the annual total energy budget of the
bird and ﬁsh assemblages, respectively. Seasonal contrasts be-
tween allochthonous prey supply and in situ prey biomass deter-
mine the importance of reciprocal subsidies.
forest–stream ecotone u allochthonous prey ﬂux
A
regional landscape is a heterogeneous collection of habitats
that differ in various environmental properties, namely
medium, temperature, light, nutrients, productivity, and species
composition. Apparently discrete food webs developing in local
habitats can be, however, tightly linked by an energy flux across
the interface between the habitats. In each habitat, across-
habitat transfers of materials or organisms often exert critical
influences on communities (1, 2). Theoretical considerations of
such trophic interactions have proposed that energy generally
flows from more to less productive habitats and provides sig-
nificant subsidies to recipient systems only (2–5). Most empirical
studies have dealt only with such one-sided subsidies (1, 2).
However, productivity in a local habitat generally fluctuates
seasonally, and on other time scales. Peak productivities in
juxtaposed habitats can be asynchronous. If decoupled fluctu-
ations reverse the productivity gradient and the direction of
energy transfer between contiguous habitats, local communities
in both habitats could be subsidized reciprocally and alternately.
Reciprocal subsidies may be important between forest and
streams in northern temperate latitudes, where two principal
determinants of primary productivity, temperature and light,
change dramatically with season. Forest and stream food webs
are widely viewed as energetically coupled, with considerable
edge-mediated effects (5). Inputs of particulate organic matter
from riparian forests represent an important energy source of
stream production (6, 7). Accidental inputs of terrestrial inver-
tebrates, in particular, are known to be a major prey category
directly available for stream consumers such as fish (8–12).
Conversely, previous studies have often argued that riparian
forests generally support greater species diversity and population
abundance of terrestrial consumers than adjacent upland habi-
tats (13, 14), although the mechanisms responsible for this edge
effect have remained poorly understood (5). Riparian con-
sumers, e.g., birds, bats, and spiders, may benefit from energy
transfers gained from aquatic insects emerged from streams
(15–17). Net flux direction, however, can change seasonally.
Terrestrial plant productivity peaks in summer, and decreases
with the approach of winter in forests, as air temperatures drop.
In contrast, streams can experience relatively stable water
temperatures throughout the year (see Fig. 1A). Especially in
temperate deciduous forest, stream productivity is highest dur-
ing the forest defoliation period (autumn and spring) and
declines in summer as streams become more shaded by riparian
canopies (18). These seasonal asynchronies in productivity max-
ima between streams and adjacent forests could set the stage for
reciprocal subsidies to both terrestrial and aquatic predators in
many temperate ecosystems. Here we present empirical evi-
dence for such reciprocal subsidies to forest birds and stream
fishes by allochthonous prey flux across a habitat interface.
Study Site. Field studies, involving '3,500 person-hours, were
conducted in a forest plot [200 m wide 3 500 m long, 10 hectare
(ha) area] along the Horonai Stream in the Tomakomai Exper-
imental Forest (TOEF; 42° 439 N, 141° 369 E), Hokkaido, Japan,
during the 14 months from May 1997 to June 1998. The forest
was dominated by deciduous tree species oak (Quercus crispula),
cherry (Prunus sargentii), and ash (Fraxinus mandshurica), and
30 other canopy species. There is no clear boundary between
riparian and upland forest types. In the forest, most tree species
break bud in early June and shed their leaves in mid October. In
this small, cold-spring-fed stream [15.4 km2 in drainage area, 14
km long, 2–5 m wide, gradient ,1%], discharge remained stable
(0.25 m2zs21 on average), with major flood disturbance rarely
occurring. No scouring floods occurred during the study period.
Approximately 97% of the entire width of the study reach was
shaded by the forest canopy during the leafing period (Fig. 1B).
Although mean monthly air temperatures fluctuated consider-
ably (Fig. 1A), water temperatures in a study reach (3.5 m wide 3
1.2 km long, 4,200 m2 area) running across the plot usually
remained stable throughout the year (Fig. 1A).
Consumers. In the forest, insectivorous birds included four year-
round residents (the great tit Parus major, the marsh tit Parus
palustris, the nuthatch Sitta europaea, and the pigmy woodpecker
Dendrocopos kizuki), five summer residents (the brown fly-
catcher Muscicapa latirostris, the pale-legged willow warbler
Phylloscopus tenellipes, the narcissus flycatcher Ficedula nar-
cissina, the crowned willow warbler Phylloscopus occipitalis, and
the black-faced bunting Emberiza spodocephala), and a winter
resident wren (Troglodytes troglodytes). Nine other species were
also observed. All of the summer and winter birds arrived at the
study area in May and October and left in August and March,
respectively. The stream was inhabited by four water-column
salmonids, including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss),
white-spotted char (Salvelinus malma), Dolly Varden (Salvelinus
malma), and masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou). These sal-
monids, and a benthic sculpin (Cottus nozawae), were all fluvial
insectivores.

Methods
Prey Abundance. The biomass of invertebrate prey was surveyed
in both the forest plot and stream reach every month. Terrestrial
invertebrates on the foliage (.2 m high) were collected quan-
titatively from 40 oak, eight linden (Tilia japonica), cherry,
painted maple (Acer mono), Japanese maple (Acer palmatum var.
matsumurae), and lilac (Syringa reticulata) trees chosen haphaz-
ardly every month (19). A branch was held onto a tray (80 3 80
cm area) and beaten repeatedly, and the arthropods which
dropped onto the tray were collected. Leaves were carefully
checked, and remaining invertebrates, including leaf rollers,
were collected. Mean diameter at the base of the branch was
2.8 6 0.7 cm (n 5 80). The biomass of stream invertebrates was
estimated from samples collected from twelve haphazardly
chosen locations in the study reach (20). The stream inverte-
brates were collected by a 225-mm mesh Surber net sampler
(25 3 25 cm quadrat, 1 m net length). In addition, across-habitat
prey fluxes, including both the accidental inputs of terrestrial
invertebrates to and the emergence of aquatic insects from the
study reach, were simultaneously estimated. Emerging aquatic
prey were collected daily with 18 square-pyramid emergence
traps (1 3 1 m area, 1 m high, made of 0.5 mm mesh) set across
the study reach at a height of 1 cm above the stream surface. The
traps were deployed concurrently for four days twice a month,
with their bases located just above the water surface. The daily
input of terrestrial prey was estimated from samples collected by
15 pan traps (1 3 1 m area, 15 cm deep) set in a current of the
stream. The traps were filled with water plus 2–3 drops of
surfactant, and set across the entire length of the study reach.
The pan contents were sieved with 250-mm mesh after 1-weeks
deployment. Beating, Surber net, emergence, and pan trap
samples were preserved in 70% ethanol and sorted into terres-
trial and aquatic invertebrates, both of which were identified to
order. The biomass of each order (measured as wet mass and dry
mass) was subsequently estimated (cf. 10). Aquatic insects in the
pan traps and beating samples, and terrestrial invertebrates in
the emergence traps, all of which contributed only a minor
portion (,5%) of the total biomass in each, were excluded from
all of the analyses.
Consumers. Monthly changes in prey composition were examined
for the dominant bird and fish species. To make the bird
observations, 20-m square grids were established with colored
markers placed on the forest floor. Observers walked along the
grid on a systematic basis during a 5-h period immediately after
dawn everyday (excepting rainy days) during the study period,
and directly observed bird foraging to record prey categories.
Prey types were classified into terrestrial preys including inver-
tebrates and plant materials, and aquatic invertebrate preys.

When an individual was encountered, it was followed for as long
as possible (within 40 m of the original location); we were able
to identify prey categories for 7,200 (53.6%; 114 for each species
in each month on average) of a total of 13,433 observations. The
stomach contents of 1,409 individual fish (20 individuals of each
species each month on average) were also examined. Fishes were
captured during a 5-h period immediately after dawn by using a
backpack electrofishing unit (Model 12, Smith-Root, Inc., Van-
couver, WA). Fish diets were collected by using a stomach
pumping method (12) and samples were preserved in 70%
ethanol. The biomass of stream fishes was estimated by the
three-pass removal method (21) in four subreaches (50 m long,
3.5 m wide, on average, 175 m2 area) in the study reach in May,
August, and November 1997, and February and May 1998. The
total fish biomass ranged between 963.3 and 1265.5 g (wet mass)
per 175 m2 over the five seasons. The bird abundance excluding
the nestlings was also surveyed by a mapping method (22). The
total abundance of 10 dominant bird species examined ranged
between 36 and 94 in a 10 ha plot over the study period (five
seasons).
Energy Flows. The annual contribution of allochthonous prey (i.e.,
aquatic and terrestrial prey for birds and fishes, respectively) to
the total energy budget was estimated for each assemblage as
well as for individual species, by using the data obtained from
May 1997 to April 1998. For each bird species, the daily energy
demand (E) was estimated from E 5 4.2 BM (0.61) kj (where
BM 5 body mass g; ref. 23), which was then multiplied by the
frequency of aquatic prey foraging to total observations so as to
estimate their energy contribution. The energy value of prey was
taken as being equal for terrestrial and aquatic prey, because of
the considerable overlap in individual dry mass and calorific
value (Nakano and Murakami, unpublished data). Fish daily
ration (R: mg per 100 mg dry mass fish d21) was estimated from
the following [salmonids, r 5 e21.857 1 0.196T, R2 5 0.71, P ,
0.0001, n 5 32; sculpin, r 5 e22.89 1 0.212T, R2 5 0.881, P 5 0.006,
n 5 8, where T 5 monthly mean temperature; ref. 24]. The
salmonid species were taken as being equal. Subsequently, their
monthly consumption rate of terrestrial prey was obtained by
multiplying the estimated ration by the mean proportion of the
terrestrial invertebrates (by mass) in the total stomach contents
for each species. All values were converted into an area-based,
annual unit (cf. 25), taking seasonal changes in the abundance of
bird and the biomass of fishes into consideration.
Results and Discussion
The seasonal dynamics of the allochthonous prey supply differed
considerably from the in situ prey biomass in both the forest and
the stream (Fig. 1 C and D). In the forest, terrestrial prey biomass
during the leafing period was much greater than that during
defoliation periods, peaking in mid summer (August) and being
nearly zero during winter (December to March; Fig. 1C).
Although aquatic prey flux to the forest was greatest around bud
breaking (May to June; Fig. 1C), a low level of emergence was
observed continuously, even during winter. In contrast, aquatic
prey biomass during the defoliation period was much greater
than that during the leafing period (Fig. 1D). Terrestrial prey
flux to the stream was proportional to biomass of terrestrial prey
(r 5 0.92, P , 0.0001). Although aquatic prey flux to the forest
was not correlated with biomass of aquatic prey in the stream
(r 5 0.029, P 5 0.92), the flux peaked simultaneously with
benthic biomass in June.
The aquatic prey provided significant seasonal subsidies to
forest birds during the defoliation period, accounting for 50–
90% of the monthly energy budget in half of the species (Fig. 2A).
In both resident great tit and nuthatch, intake rates of aquatic
prey were much higher during the defoliation period than during
the leafing periods. During winter, both species foraged inten-
sively on emerged aquatic prey while searching along the stream
banks. However, aquatic prey accounted for only a small portion
of the resource in other resident birds, such as marsh tit and
pigmy woodpecker. The seasonal change in aquatic prey contri-
bution was negatively related to terrestrial prey biomass for great
tit, marsh tit, and nuthatch, but not for pigmy woodpecker (Table
1). The contribution of aquatic prey to the annual, total resource
budget was estimated as 38.6% for great tit, 31.9% for nuthatch,
7.4% for marsh tit, and 9.5% for pigmy woodpecker (Fig. 3).
Even within the short residence of summer birds, drastic
changes were found in their aquatic prey use, with significant
variation among the species (Fig. 2A). In all of the species, the
contribution decreased dramatically with bud break, and re-
mained continually low until the birds departed in August. A
higher aquatic prey contribution was observed again during the
periods characterized by smaller terrestrial prey biomass, but not
with greater aquatic prey flux. The total contribution of aquatic
prey was estimated as 31.8% in brown flycatcher, 35.0% in
pale-legged willow warbler, 15.5% in narcissus flycatcher, 9.4%
in crowned willow warbler, and 20.5% in black-faced bunting,

during their four-month stay (Fig. 3). The winter wren was
largely dependent on aquatic prey, which contributed 98.2% of
the six-month resource budget. This species was frequently
observed to catch the aquatic prey from the stream channel as
well as on the banks. Pooling of data for all of the bird species
showed aquatic prey as accounting for 25.6% of the annual total
energy demand of the entire bird assemblage (402,607 kj per 10
ha y21).
Similarly, allochthonous fluxes of terrestrial insect prey also
subsidized stream fishes, the flux contributing greatly (60–
100%) to the food resource, especially, of the three water-
column-dwelling fishes during the leafing periods (Fig. 2B). For
all of the fishes, the proportion of terrestrial prey in the diets
during leafing was much greater than that during defoliation,
although it varied among the species. Terrestrial prey input was
a better predictor of seasonal change in terrestrial prey contri-
bution to fish diet than aquatic prey biomass (Table 1). In all of
the fish species, the greater the terrestrial prey flux, the greater
its contribution, with minor influences of aquatic prey biomass
in rainbow trout and sculpin. The contribution of terrestrial prey
to an annual resource budget was estimated as 46.3% in rainbow
trout, 50.5% in white-spotted char, 22.6% in Dolly Varden,
56.7% in masu salmon, and 12.0% in sculpin (Fig. 3). When all
of the species were pooled, terrestrial prey input was estimated
as contributing to 44.0% of the annual, total resource budget of
the stream fish assemblage (531,421 kj per 4,200 m2zy21).
Both forest birds and stream fishes were reciprocally subsi-
dized by invertebrate prey flux across the habitat interface. Such
allochthonous prey fluxes could be a critical factor in maintain-
ing both the forest bird and stream fish assemblages simply
because they greatly augmented the resource budgets of the
assemblages annually as well as seasonally. The most important
element of these reciprocal subsidies, however, was the seasonal
asynchrony in the dynamics of in situ prey biomass and alloch-
thonous prey supply. The stream supplied great energy transfers
to the riparian forest, primarily when terrestrial prey biomass was
relatively low. Because the birds exploited aquatic prey inten-
sively when the terrestrial resource was scarce, seasonal asyn-
chrony could be a principal factor controlling the subsidy

efficiency of aquatic prey flux. Although great terrestrial prey
inputs occurred when the aquatic resource was scarce, terrestrial
prey contribution to fish diets was more closely linked with their
flux per se than with the in situ resource level. This may indicate
greater availability of terrestrial prey than aquatic prey (12).
The reciprocal prey flux across a forest–stream interface could
have indirect but significant influences on food web dynamics by
altering the top-down effects of subsidized predators in both
habitats, as pointed out by both recent theoretical (4) and
experimental studies (11, 26). The importance of understanding
such ecological functions produced by habitat linkages is grow-
ing because human interference is rapidly altering the spatial
patterns of habitat interfaces on a broad scale. Well developed
overhanging vegetation in a riparian forest, for instance, can
enhance the input of terrestrial invertebrates (27). Furthermore,
meandering andyor braided stream channels can be expected to
increase the supply of emerging aquatic insects per unit area of
forest. However, increasing destruction of stream banks by
various human activities, e.g., riparian deforestation, channel-
ization, or road construction, can seriously impair reciprocal
energy exchange. The importance of reciprocal resource subsi-
dies between habitats indicates that the loss or degradation of
one habitat may have more detrimental effects on neighboring
communities than we have previously recognized.
