The genes that determine the development of the male or female
sex are known in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and most
mammals. In many other organisms the existence of sex-determin-
ing factors has been shown by genetic evidence but the genes are
unknown. We have found that in the ﬁsh medaka the Y chromo-
some-speciﬁc region spans only about 280 kb. It contains a dupli-
cated copy of the autosomal DMRT1 gene, named DMRT1Y. This is
the only functional gene in this chromosome segment and maps
precisely to the male sex-determining locus. The gene is expressed
during male embryonic and larval development and in the Sertoli
cells of the adult testes. These features make DMRT1Y a candidate
for the medaka male sex-determining gene.
T
he overwhelming majority of multicellular animal species
occur as both sexes, and in many cases the decision of
whether an organism becomes a male or a female is determined
by the genome. In most mammals, several flies, and the worm
Caenorhabditis elegans the cascades of sex-determining genes are
reasonably well understood. However, the master regulator
encoded by the sex-determining locus (SD) on the Y chromo-
some of most mammalian species, SRY, is not functioning like
that in some mammals (1). In nonmammalian species, which also
have a XXXY sex-determination system, SRY is not present at
all. Neither the sxl gene of Drosophila nor xol of C. elegans, the
genes at the top of the sex-determination cascade in these
organisms, are functioning in the same way in more distantly
related species (for review see ref. 2). This finding indicates that
on the molecular level another dimension of diversity is added
to the complex situation of multiple genetic systems for sex
determination. In between worms and flies on the one side and
mammals on the other side, there is a large gap in our knowledge
about sex-determination genes.
Fishes are an attractive group of organisms for studying the
evolution of sex determination because members of this class
exemplify a broad range of various types of sex determination
from hermaphroditism to gonochorism and from environmental
to genetic sex determination (for review see refs. 3 and 4). The
structure and expression of genes involved in sex determination
and differentiation can be compared in species, which exhibit
either similar or divergent sex-determination systems. Unfortu-
nately, in both main fish models, the pufferfish (Takifugu
rubripes) and the zebrafish (Danio rerio), no information exists
on the mode of sex determination, the potential presence of sex
chromosomes, and the process of sex differentiation.
The situation for a molecular analysis of sex determination is
much more favorable in another fish model, the medaka (Oryzias
latipes) (for review see ref. 5). Medaka has a XXXY sex
determination system like mammals. Male and female medakas
are easily distinguished by a number of secondary sex characters
(see ref. 6). A linkage map of the sex chromosomes with several
molecular and phenotypic markers is available (7, 8). Especially
useful is the quart strain, where the sex chromosomes express
different alleles of the lf pigment marker. The presence of
leucophores in the male and their absence in the female allow
differentiation of both sexes as early as at 2–3 days of embryonic
development (9).
From the genes known to be involved in sex determination
differentiation the DMRT genes are of special interest because
of their widespread distribution. They form a family of genes,
which share a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (10), the
DM domain. DMRT1 is a candidate downstream sex-
determination gene in mammals and appears to be involved in
a certain type of XY sex reversal in humans (11–13). It is
conserved in a wide range of animals with diverse sex-
determining mechanisms, including C. elegans, Drosophila, fish,
reptiles, birds, and mammals (14–19).
We have investigated a potential role for DMRT genes in sex
determination of medaka and found that a duplicated copy of
DMRT1 is present at the male SD and shows all features of a
sex-determining gene.
Materials and Methods
Medaka Fish. All experimental animals were from inbred lines of
Northern (Kaga, HNI) and Southern medakas (i-3, quart,
HB32C, SOK) except for the Carbio strain, which is an outbred
strain derived from the Southern population of medaka.
Cloning and Sequence Analysis. To obtain the Y-chromosomal
DMRT gene the male-specific band from Southern blots of
genomic DNA was excised and cloned. Briefly, the 3.3-kb
male-specific EcoRI fragment from medaka (strain Carbio) was
cloned by excising the 3- to 4-kb EcoRI fragments from a
preparative 0.8% agarose gel. The DNA was ligated into ZapII
EcoRI arms (Stratagene) and packaged in vitro. The resulting
subgenomic library was screened with the 4-kb EcoRI fragment
from medaka cosmid 73K2481, which contains exons 1–3 of the
autosomal DMRT1 gene.
Filters of arrayed medaka genomic cosmid libraries (nos. 73
and 74) were obtained from the Resource Center of the German
Human Genome Project (Berlin) and screened with the human
DMRT1 cDNA under conditions of low stringency (hybridiza-
tion: 35% formamide, 42°C; washing: 1 SSC1% SDS, 63°C).
Positive clones were initially characterized and arranged in
groups by restriction fragment analysis and Southern blotting.

Restriction fragments cross-hybridizing with the human DMRT1
probe were subcloned and sequenced.
For isolation of a medaka DMRT1Y cDNA, total RNA was
isolated from 6-day-old embryos (strain Carbio). Reverse tran-
scription was done with oligo(dT)12–18 and Superscript II reverse
transcriptase following the supplier’s protocol (GIBCOBRL).
For PCR from 3 l of the reverse transcription reaction, primers
based on the genomic sequence of DMRT1Y (DMTYh: TCT
GCT GAG CTC CCC GGG; DMTYi: GCC TCG CAG CTT
CTC A) were used. The PCR was run for 35 cycles at an
annealing temperature of 62°C. The sequence of DMRT1Y is
deposited under GenBank accession no. AY129240.
Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) Isolation and Analysis. A
genomic BAC library of the HNI strain with an average insert
size of 160 kb was constructed (20). BAC clones containing the
DM domain sequences were screened by colony hybridization
under low stringency with the PCR fragment of the DM domain
of medaka DMRT4 (20). The clones containing DMRT1Y were
selected by PCR screening with a specific primer set (DMTk:
CAA CTT TGT CCA AAC TCT GA; DMTl: AAC TAA TTC
ATC CCC ATT CC). The contig was extended by using PCR end
fragments as probes, and BACs 168M02, 209O12, and 113N21
were shotgun-sequenced.
Sequences were analyzed by application of the NIX software
tool (www.hgmp.mrc.ac.ukNIX). Putative exons and genes
were compared at the nucleotide and amino acid levels to known
genes by standard GCG programs and by BLAST and FASTA
database searches. The relevant part of the contig is deposited
under GenBank accession no. AY129241.
Southern Blot Analysis. DNA from individual fish was obtained
from pooled organs as described. Five micrograms of genomic
DNA was digested with restriction enzymes, separated on 0.8%
agarose gels, and blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond N,
Amersham Pharmacia). Membranes were hybridized either un-
der conditions of moderate stringency [hybridization in 35%
formamide, 0.1% Na-pyrophosphate, 50 mM TrisCl (pH 7.5),
5  SSC, 1% SDS, 5  Denhardt’s, 100 gml calf thymus DNA
at 42°C, washing in 1  SSC1% SDS at 60°C] or high stringency
(hybridization in the same buffer except that the formamide
concentration was 50% and at the same temperature, washing
in 0.1  SSC1% SDS at 68°C) with the following probes:
OlaDMRT1, 4-kb EcoRI fragment from cosmid 73K2481;
OlaDMRT1Y, 1.1-kb NheISstI fragment from phage 2.1 of the
subgenomic library; and HsaDMRT1, 1.5-kb EcoRI fragment
from the human DMRT1 cDNA.
Expression Analysis. Total RNA was extracted from pooled organs
of several adult medaka fish or 10–40 pooled total embryos of
defined stages (21) by using the TRIZOL reagent (GIBCO
BRL) according to the supplier’s recommendation. After DNase
treatment reverse transcription was done with 2 or 4 g total
RNA by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (GIBCO
BRL) and random primers. cDNA from 10 ng (actin) to 200 ng
(adult organs) or 600 ng (whole embryos) of total RNA was used
for PCR with gene-specific primers: Ola Actin, MAct1(TTC
AAC AGC CCT GCC ATG TA) and MAct 2 (GCA GCT CAT
AGC TCT TCT CCA GGG AG) at an annealing temperature of
60°C for 25 cycles; Ola DMRT1, DMT1m (TCC GGC TCC ACA
GCG GTC) and DMT1n(CAG ACA GAG GGT TGG GGG G)
at an annealing temperature of 64°C for 35 cycles; Ola DMRT1Y,
DMTYa (GGCCGGGTCCCCGGGTG) and DMTYc (CTG
GTA CTG CTG GTA GTT GTG) at an annealing temperature
of 64°C for 35 cycles.
RNA from sex-reversed embryos and adults was obtained
after treating embryos from day 1 until hatching with 1 mgml
17 estradiol in the rearing medium essentially as described (22).
Whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization on adult testis was
performed according to standard protocols (23). Samples were
digested with proteinase K for 2 min before hybridization with
a 488-nt DMRT1Y antisense riboprobe at 65°C. The riboprobe
was generated from a partial cDNA that was obtained by reverse
transcription–PCR using the DMTYa and DMTYc primers.
Stained tissue samples were paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and
counterstained with eosin.
Mapping. A sex-reversed XY female backcross panel was gener-
ated as reported (8). A total of 117 backcross progeny were
analyzed for four STS markers (Yc-2, Casp6, SL1, Casp3B) that
were previously isolated (7, 8, 24) and two phenotypic markers
(lf: leucophore, y: male sex). DMRT1Y was mapped by PCR
using primers DMTk and DMTn (TGA TGC AGC ATT TTG
ACA CAT TTA). The products were electrophoresed on 6%
acrylamide gels. Segregation of the markers was analyzed with
Macintosh MAPMAKER version 2 (25).
Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization. BAC clones were labeled sep-
arately by standard nick translation using biotin-16-dUTP and
digoxigenin-11-dUTP. For two-color hybridization equal
amounts of labeled probes were mixed with hybridization solu-
tion at a final concentration of 10 gml and used at 100 ng per
slide. Before hybridizing with denatured medaka mitotic chro-
mosomes the probe mixture was denatured and preannealed in
the presence of excess genomic DNA. Hybridization sites for
both probes were simultaneously detected by means of rhoda-
mine-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories) and antidigoxi-
genin (monoclonal)-conjugated fluorescein (Sigma). Chromo-
somes were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). Digitized images of the FITC and rhodamine signals
were captured separately and displayed on DAPI-stained chro-
mosomes by using EASY FISH 1.0 software (Applied Spectral
Imaging, Mannheim, Germany).
Results
In our studies on sex-determining genes in the medaka we have
recently found that the DMRT1 homologue of medaka is located
on an autosome in a gene cluster together with its paralogues,
DMRT 2 and 3 (26). cDNA probes from human and medaka
DMRT1 used on Southern blots of male and female DNA
disclosed an additional fragment only in males (Fig. 1 a–e). The
male-specific fragment was cloned from a partial genomic library
and found to be a duplicated version of DMRT1, showing 93%
identity on the nucleotide and 90% similarity on the amino acid
level (Fig. 2). It has a nucleotide identity of 96% (92% amino
acids) to the DMY gene isolated by Matsuda et al. (27). The
sequence differences probably are caused by different strains of
medaka that were used for analyses. PCR primers specific to the
Y-chromosomal copy (designated DMRT1Y) were used for a
linkage analysis (Fig. 1f). DMRT1Y was found in all 81 males but
not in 57 females of the i-3 strain and in 226 tested females of
seven other strains from the Northern and Southern medaka
populations. For mapping we used the sex-reversed (XY fe-
male  XY male; ref. 8) backcross mapping panel, which spreads
the map distances of Y-chromosomal markers in the vicinity of
SD by a factor of 10 compared with the resolution obtained with
a male backcross panel. No recombination between SD and
DMRT1Y was detected (Fig. 1g), whereas all earlier described
markers map with some distance left and right to SD (8, 24).
Thus DMRT1Y and the male SD colocalize on the genetic map
(linkage 0.24 cM, equivalent to approximately 125 kb accord-
ing to refs. 7 and 28).
Sequence analysis of BACs from a genomic library of the HNI
strain, cosmids from two independent genomic libraries of
Northern (Kaga strain) and Southern (Carbio strain) medaka,
and a full-length testis cDNA further confirmed that DMRT1Y

has all of the features of a functional gene and is not corrupted
by mutation. BAC 15H17, which contains DMRT1Y, and adja-
cent BACs were used for fluorescence in situ hybridization
analysis (Fig. 3) on male and female metaphases. BACs con-
taining the marker sequences flanking the male-determining
locus [SL1, Casp3B (data not shown), Casp6 (data not shown)]
gave signals on both the X and Y chromosomes. Neighboring
BACs that overlap with l5H17 hybridized to the Y and X
chromosome as well. However, BAC 15H17 gave a strong
hybridization signal only on the Y, but not the X. Weak signals
were obtained with BAC 15H17 at the subtelomeric region of a
chromosome pair that is equivalent to linkage group 9 of
medaka. This is the location of the autosomal DMRT cluster.
Analysis of the contiguous sequence of three overlapping
BACs (covering 380 kb, roughly equivalent to 0.74 cM; refs. 7
and 28) revealed the size and the borders of the duplicated
region on the Y (Fig. 4). Downstream of the Y-specific region a
gene is encoded that is the medaka orthologue of human
KIAA0032 (GenBank accession no. BAA04945). This gene (as
well as the next one, KIAA0914, GenBank accession no.
XP003489) is also present on the X, thus defining the down-
stream limit of the Y-specific segment. At the upstream border
of the Y-specific fragment another copy of KIAA0032 is present.
Thus, the size of the Y-specific fragment is about 260 kb. In the
Y-specific region DMRT1Y is the only gene that is not corrupted
by mutations. There are remnants of three other genes that are
also found adjacent to DMRT1 on the autosome and a fourth one
from elsewhere in the genome, but they are all nonfunctional.
From the BAC sequences no other functional gene is predicted
by using 11 different gene or exonintron prediction programs.
However, a strikingly high number of transposons and other
repetitive sequences were noticed, consistent with the expected
genetic degeneration and recombinational isolation of the chro-
mosomal region surrounding SD on the male-determining chro-
mosome (29).
In adult fish DMRT1Y is expressed only in testes like the
autosomal DMRT1 (Fig. 5a). The transcript is localized in the
Sertoli cells (Fig. 5b). During development DMRT1Y expression
starts at the neurula stage and persists during embryogenesis and
larval stages to adulthood (Fig. 5c). It is expressed only in male
embryos. The expression of the autosomal DMRT1 starts much
later, around day 20.

To analyze whether DMRT1Y is an upstream sex-determining
gene or a more downstream sex-differentiation gene we analyzed
the expression of DMRT1Y in XY sex-reversed females. During
the estrogen treatment and after hatching the expression of
DMRT1Y was not affected. The transcript was even detected in
the ovary of the adult XY females at levels comparable to testes
(Fig. 5d).
Discussion
In medaka the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosomes
is very large. In fact, sex chromosomal crossing-over occurs over
the entire length of the chromosome, with the possible exception
of the region immediately adjacent to SD on the Y chromosome
where an extremely high density of markers could not be ordered
because of lack of detectable recombination (7, 8, 24). Linkage
group 1, which contains SD, is the largest one and is equivalent
to one pair of homomorphic chromosomes of the largest group.
All markers mapped on linkage group 1 (the sex chromosomes)
are shared between the X and Y chromosomes, whereas the
markers generated from the Y-specific fragment are present only
on the Y chromosome (data not shown). This finding indicates
that the Y-specific region may be very small. Together with the
fact that DMRT1Y is highly similar to its ancestor DMRT1, which
points to a recent rather than to an ancient duplication event, it
appears that the sex chromosomes of medaka are at an early
stage of evolution.
Gene hierarchy studies in the worm and the fly revealed that
the corresponding DMRT1 homologues mab-3 and DSX are
placed at the bottom of the sex-determination cascade. From an
evolutionary point of view it appears that the genes at the top of
the hierarchy, which rule the mechanism of sex determination,
have become involved in this process only relatively recently.
However, at least some of the downstream genes, like DMRT1,
are conserved with respect to sequence and function (2, 30, 31).
Based on findings that DMRT1 is Z-linked in chicken it has been
suggested that DMRT1 in birds has been recruited as an up-
stream regulatory sex-determining factor (16, 32). In chicken
DMRT1 expression precedes expression of all other potential SD
genes, is stronger in male than in female gonads, and is evident
before the sex differentiation of the gonad anlage starts (18, 19).

chromosomes.

Schematic representation of the DMRT1Y-containing region. Lines above show the analyzed BAC and cosmid clones. Genes and sequences with predicted
homology to known genes are shown as boxes: striped, DMRT1Y; hatched, DMRT3; light gray, KIAA0032; black, KIAA0172 and MHCL. The region upstream
of KIAA0172 contains only repetitive DNA and sequences with similarity to transposable elements of various organisms. Two genes upstream of DMRT1, a
myosin heavy chain like gene (MHCL) and an ankyrin repeat containing gene (orthologous to human KIAA0172), are part of the duplicated fragment from linkage
group 9 on the Y. The duplicated Y-chromosomal copy of MHCL is, however, destroyed by insertion of a poseidon element, a non-long terminal repeat retroposon
(40), in Southern medaka and additionally a TX-1-related transposon in Northern medaka. The Y-chromosomal version of KIAA0172 is corrupted by a deletion
that takes out two exons. In addition, the 5 part of the gene is missing, indicating the border of the duplicated fragment. In intron 4 of DMRT1Y an insertion
has occurred. This insertion contains a duplicated copy of the putative medaka homologue of the human brain and testes antigen gene MAP1 that is located
on medaka linkage group 19 (M.K., H. Mitani, A.S., and M.S., unpublished work). The Y-chromosomal copy of MAP1, however, has a frameshift mutation that
leads to a prematurely terminated protein. Downstream of the Y-chromosomal DMRT1 a copy of DMRT3 is found. But its coding sequence is lacking the ATG
start codon and it has several frameshifts. DMRT2, which is the next gene following DMRT3 on the autosomal cluster, is not found in the Y-speciﬁc region.

However, the exact map position of DMRT1 on chicken Z in
relation to the male SD locus remains to be determined. In the
temperature-dependent sex determination of alligators and tur-
tles, DMRT1 exhibits the expected expression pattern for a
sex-determining gene (19, 33). In rainbow trout it has been
shown that DMRT1 is expressed in the developing male gonad
before morphological differentiation (15). In the mouse gonad
specific expression of DMRT1 is detected at embryonic day 9.5,
whereas Sry expression begins around embryonic day 10.5 (18).
Also in humans the simultaneous onset of DMRT1 and Sry
expression suggested a role of DMRT1 in early events of sex
determination (34).
What makes DMRT1Y in medaka a reasonable candidate for
a sex-determination gene? The usual experimental tools to
confirm a candidate gene cannot be applied here. In medaka,
like in many other fish, sex can be experimentally reversed by
steroid treatment or interfering with the activity of sex-
differentiation genes. This means that transgenic expression of
genes that act downstream in the sex-determination cascade or
even sex-differentiation genes will lead to full sex reversal as well.
Blocking DMRT1Y activity by antisense oligonucleotides cannot
be used either, because the gonad is the last organ system to
develop in medaka (35), and even morpholinos are not stable
enough to be effective (data not shown). Matsuda et al. (27)
found that a point mutation in the DMY (DMRT1Y) leads to XY
male to female sex reversal. This finding shows convincingly that
this gene is necessary for male sexual development. Also in
humans the loss of DMRT1 is connected to XY sex reversals
(11–13, 36). DMRT1 knockout mice revealed that the gene is
essential for testis development (37). Thus, the data are not
informative whether the gene in medaka has a different (more
upstream) or a similar function (more downstream) like that in
mammals. Of course, the linkage of DMRT1Y to the male SD
(independently seen in this and another study, ref. 27) is pretty
suggestive for its function as the primary sex-determining gene.
As genetic mapping has only a certain resolution, a candidate
gene may be located very close but not exactly at the locus
encoding the phenotype in question. Thus further cumulative
evidence should be helpful.
First, our finding of expression of DMRT1Y in XY sex-
reversed females indicates that DMRT1Y is located upstream in
the genetic hierarchy and is not one of the male sex-
differentiation genes that have to be suppressed by sex-reverting
hormone treatment. This experiment, however, does not rule out
a difference in activity of DMRT1Y in sex-reversed animals, for
instance if DMRT1Y is regulated posttranscriptionally. Second,
the expression pattern of DMRT1Y is consistent with a sex-
determination function. It is expressed early and exclusively in
the male embryo. Most importantly, DMRT1Y in medaka is the
only functional gene found in the Y chromosome-specific seg-
ment at the sex-determining region. The fact that androgen
treatment during the sensitive period produces functional XX
sex-reversed males that are fully fertile (6) excludes that sper-
matogenesis or other sex-differentiation genes are present on the
Y, unlike the situation in mammals (38, 39). Hence, DMRT1Y is
not involved in these processes but should have a function as a
male sex-determination gene.
Experiments on the biochemical function of DMRT1Y are
needed to understand how this gene functions in the male
sex-determination process. The origin of DMRT1Y from an
autosomal gene raises the question of what role gene duplication
of sex determination and differentiation genes may play in the
evolution of sex-determination systems. Such studies in suitable
fish models might also help to contribute to our understanding
of the function of DMRTs in mammals.
