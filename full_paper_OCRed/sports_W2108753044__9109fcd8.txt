ATIONAL AND INTERNA-
tional public health authori-
ties agree that children and
adolescents should accumu-
late at least 60 minutes of moderate- to
vigorous-intensity physical activity
(MVPA) daily.1-6 Although the exact
amount of physical activity needed for
optimal health is unknown, recent
research has established inverse cross-
sectional associations between objec-
tivelymeasuredphysicalactivitywithadi-
posity and cardiometabolic risk factors
in youth.7-10
Many health authorities and organi-
zations have also recognized the poten-
tially detrimental effects of prolonged
time spent sedentary and consequently
compiled guidelines for reducing the
amount of sedentary time, especially TV
viewing.3-6,11 Some recent reports ap-
pear to confirm the importance of re-
ducing sedentary time in youth as they
suggest that higher levels of objectively
measured time spent sedentary is asso-
ciatedwithadiposity8andanadversecar-
diometabolic risk profile.12

Context Sparse data exist on the combined associations between physical activity
and sedentary time with cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy children.
Objective To examine the independent and combined associations between objec-
tively measured time in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and
sedentary time with cardiometabolic risk factors.
Design, Setting, and Participants Pooled data from 14 studies between 1998
and 2009 comprising 20 871 children (aged 4-18 years) from the International Chil-
dren’s Accelerometry Database. Time spent in MVPA and sedentary time were mea-
sured using accelerometry after reanalyzing raw data. The independent associations
between time in MVPA and sedentary time, with outcomes, were examined using meta-
analysis. Participants were stratified by tertiles of MVPA and sedentary time.
Main Outcome Measures Waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, fasting
triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin.
Results Times (mean [SD] min/d) accumulated by children in MVPA and being seden-
tary were 30 (21) and 354 (96), respectively. Time in MVPA was significantly associated
withallcardiometabolicoutcomesindependentofsex,age,monitorweartime,timespent
sedentary, and waist circumference (when not the outcome). Sedentary time was not as-
sociatedwithanyoutcomeindependentoftimeinMVPA.Inthecombinedanalyses,higher
levels of MVPA were associated with better cardiometabolic risk factors across tertiles of
sedentarytime.ThedifferencesinoutcomesbetweenhigherandlowerMVPAweregreater
with lower sedentary time. Mean differences in waist circumference between the bottom
and top tertiles of MVPA were 5.6 cm (95% CI, 4.8-6.4 cm) for high sedentary time and
3.6 cm (95% CI, 2.8-4.3 cm) for low sedentary time. Mean differences in systolic blood
pressure for high and low sedentary time were 0.7 mm Hg (95% CI, −0.07 to 1.6) and 2.5
mm Hg (95% CI, 1.7-3.3), and for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, differences were
−2.6mg/dL(95%CI,−1.4to−3.9)and−4.5mg/dL(95%CI,−3.3to−5.6),respectively.
Geometric mean differences for insulin and triglycerides showed similar variation. Those
inthetoptertileofMVPAaccumulatedmorethan35minutesperdayinthisintensitylevel
compared with fewer than 18 minutes per day for those in the bottom tertile. In prospec-
tive analyses (N=6413 at 2.1 years’ follow-up), MVPA and sedentary time were not as-
sociated with waist circumference at follow-up, but a higher waist circumference at base-
line was associated with higher amounts of sedentary time at follow-up.
Conclusion Higher MVPA time by children and adolescents was associated with bet-
ter cardiometabolic risk factors regardless of the amount of sedentary time.

Time spent in MVPA is weakly to
moderately associated with time spent
sedentary in youth,8,13 suggesting both
variables may be independently asso-
ciated with cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors. However, the independent and
combined associations between objec-
tively measured time spent in MVPA
and time spent sedentary in relation to
cardiometabolic risk factors in youth re-
main unclear.
A better understanding of the rela-
tions between physical activity and sed-
entary time in relation to cardiometa-
bolicriskfactorswillaidthedevelopment
of physical activity interventions, coun-
seling, and public health policy.
Therefore, we examined the cross-
sectionalandprospectiveassociationsbe-
tween MVPA and time spent sedentary
withestablishedcardiometabolicriskfac-
tors in as many as 20 871 children and
adolescents (aged 4-18 years) using a
meta-analyticalapproachcombiningdata
from multiple cohorts in which physi-
calactivityandsedentarytimehavebeen
measured objectively by accelerometry.
METHODS
Study Design
The International Children’s Acceler-
ometry Database (ICAD, http://www
.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/Research
/Studies/) was established to pool data
on objectively measured physical ac-
tivity from studies in youth world-
wide. The aims, design, study selec-
tion, inclusion criteria, and methods of
the ICAD project have been described
in detail previously.14 Briefly, in 2008
a PubMed search for potential contribu-
tors was undertaken. From this search
19 studies using the same type of ac-
celerometer (Actigraph) and includ-
ing at least 400 participants aged 3 to
18 years were identified. Additional
studieswereidentifiedbypersonalcom-
munication. In total, 25 studies were
identified and approached, of which 21
studies contributed data to the ICAD.14
Formal data-sharing agreements were
established and all partners consulted
with their individual research board to
confirm sufficient ethical approval had
been attained for contributing data.
Participants
For the present analyses we used data
on children and adolescents (aged 4-18
years) from 14 studies from Australia,
Brazil,Europe,andtheUnitedStates,15-25
in which data on objectively measured
physical activity and at least 1 of the
cardiometabolic outcomes were avail-
able at 1 time point (N=20 871). These
studies were performed between 1998
and 2009. Information on cardiometa-
bolic outcomes was not available from
7 studies and individuals from these
studies were therefore excluded from
the present analyses. Baseline and
follow-up data for at least 1 of the out-
come variables in combination with
baseline physical activity data were
available in 6413 participants.
Measurements
Assessment of Physical Activity and
Sedentary Time. A detailed descrip-
tion of the assessment of physical ac-
tivity is available elsewhere.14 All avail-
able accelerometer data from the ICAD
project were reanalyzed to provide
physical activity outcome variables
across studies that could be directly
compared using specifically devel-
oped and commercially available soft-
ware (KineSoft, version 3.3.20). Data
files were reintegrated to a 60-second
epoch and nonwear time was defined
as 60 minutes of consecutive zeros, al-
lowing for 2 minutes of nonzero inter-
ruptions.26 All children with at least 1
day with at least 500 minutes of mea-
sured monitor wear time between 7 AM
and midnight were included. Total
physical activity was expressed as total
counts, including sedentary minutes,
divided by measured time per day
(counts/min, cpm). Time spent seden-
tary was defined as all minutes show-
ing less than 100 cpm27 and MVPA time
as minutes showing more than 3000
cpm,27-29 which corresponds to about
4.6 metabolic equivalents.27
Assessment of Anthropometry and
Cardiometabolic Outcomes. Out-
come variables were 5 established
cardiometabolic measures reflecting
abdominal adiposity (waist circum-
ference), glucose metabolism (fasting
insulin), lipid metabolism (fasting
triglycerides and HDL cholesterol),
and resting systolic blood pressure.
Skewed variables (fasting insulin and
triglycerides) were log transformed
before analyses.
Height and weight were measured
using standardized clinical proce-
dures across studies. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as weight in ki-
lograms divided by height in meters
squared and participants were catego-
rized into normal weight, overweight,
and obese groups according to age and
sex-specific cut points.30 In all studies
except for the NHANES (National
Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey), waist circumference was mea-
sured with a metal anthropometric tape
midway between the lower rib margin
and the iliac crest, at the end of gentle
expiration.15-22,25 In NHANES waist cir-
cumference was measured with a metal
tape just above the iliac crest at the
midaxillary line.31
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was
measured in 10 studies16,17,20,21,23,24,26 out
of the 14. Details of the measurements
have been reported previously.17,18,32,33
In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Par-
ents and Children (ALSPAC)25 blood
pressure was measured with a Dina-
map 9301 vital signs monitor. In the Co-
penhagen School Child Intervention
Study (CSCIS)16 and European Youth
Heart Study (EYHS [Denmark, Esto-
nia, Norway, and Portugal]),17 blood
pressure was measured using a Dina-
map XL vital signs monitor every sec-
ond minute during a 10-minute pe-
riod following a 10-minute rest in a
seated position and using the average
of the last 3 readings. In the Move-
ment and Activity Glasgow Interven-
tion in Children (MAGIC)20 and the
Pelotas21 studies, blood pressure was
measured twice after 5 to 10 minutes
of seated rest using a digital Omron
sphygmomanometer.
Of the 14 studies, at baseline, fast-
ing insulin was measured in 7 stud-
ies,16-18,23,24 and fasting triglycerides and
HDL cholesterol in 8 studies10,16-18,23,24
according to standard clinical proce-
dures as previously described.10,16,18,23,24

Statistical Analysis. Descriptive re-
sults are expressed as mean for con-
tinuous variables and percentages for
categorical variables. Differences be-
tween sexes were tested by analysis of
variance. Associations between total
physical activity (cpm), MVPA, and sed-
entary time were analyzed by Pearson
correlation coefficients.
Linear regression models were run
separately for each study to estimate the
cross-sectional associations between
total physical activity (cpm), MVPA
(min/d), and sedentary time (min/d)
with each of the outcome variables. We
thereafter mutually adjusted expo-
sures (MVPA and sedentary time) for
each other (ie, when MVPA was mod-
eled as the main exposure, the analy-
sis was adjusted for sedentary time and
when sedentary time was modeled as
the main exposure, the analysis was ad-
justed for MVPA) and examined the in-
dependent associations between MVPA
and sedentary time with each of the out-
comes. Results were expressed as re-
gression coefficients representing the
change in the outcome per 100 change
in cpm, 10-minute change in MVPA,
and 60-minute change in sedentary
time. Regression coefficients were there-
after combined across studies using ran-
dom effects meta-analysis adjusted for
sex, age, monitor wear time, and waist
circumference (when waist circumfer-
ence was not modeled as the outcome).
Heterogeneity across studies was ex-
amined by the I2 statistic. To explore
possible reasons for heterogeneity be-
tween studies in the exposure effects,
the following study-level covariates
were included in meta-regression mod-
els34: mean age, median monitor wear
time, proportion of girls, and propor-
tion of normal-weight, overweight, and
obese individuals.
Due to sex and age differences in
MVPA and sedentary time, in com-
bined associations analyses we first
stratified each outcome by sex and age
group (7 years, 7 to 9 years, 10 to 13
years, and 13 years) for MVPA and
sedentary time. These groups were then
recombined into 9 new tertile groups
with a similar mean age (range, 11.2-
11.4 years). Sex- and age-adjusted
means and 95% CI for each outcome
and tertile group were calculated and
a linear trend in the outcome across lev-
els of MVPA within tertiles of seden-
tary time was tested by analysis of vari-
ance. Mean difference and its 95% CI
between the bottom and top tertiles of
MVPA across sedentary categories were
calculated for waist circumference, sys-
tolic blood pressure, and HDL choles-
terol. Geometric ratio and its 95% CI
from bottom to top tertiles of MVPA
across sedentary categories were cal-
culated for fasting insulin and triglyc-
erides because they are log-normal
distributed.
Baseline and follow-up data on waist
circumference were available in a sub-
sample of 6413 participants. To esti-
mate the prospective association be-
tween baseline MVPA and sedentary
time with follow-up measures of waist
circumference, a similar approach to
thatdescribedpreviouslywasused,with
additional adjustment in the models for
follow-up time and the baseline value
of the outcome variable.
There were no significant MVPA by
sedentary time interactions for any of
the analyses.
Because this study was an explor-
atory analysis of observational data
rather than a confirmatory analysis of
a clinical trial, formal correction for
multiple testing was not done. All the
analyses were conducted using Stata/SE
version 11.2. All significance testing was
2-sided with a P value of less than .05
denoting statistical significance.
RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of the
studies and sample are summarized
in TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3, and
TABLE 4. Overall, 74.9% of children
were categorized as normal weight,
17.7% as overweight, and 7.4% as
obese. Children’s physical activity
was monitored for an average of 5.2
days (median, 835-min/d; 25th and
75th percentiles, 777 and 924 min/d)
and 92.3% of children provided 3
or more days of valid recordings
(500-min/d).
Boys were significantly more active
than girls and spent about 55% more
of average daytime in MVPA. Con-
versely, girls spent approximately 5%
more of the daytime sedentary. Time
spent sedentary was moderately in-
versely correlated with time spent in
MVPA (r=−0.34; P.001) and strongly
inversely correlated with total physi-
cal activity (cpm; r=−0.70; P.001).
MVPA was strongly correlated with
overall physical activity (r = 0.83;
P.001), explaining 68.9% of the vari-
ance in total physical activity.
Total physical activity (cpm) was sig-
nificantly and inversely associated with
waistcircumference,fastinginsulin,and
triglycerides after adjustment for sex,
age, and waist circumference when fast-
ing insulin and triglycerides were the
outcomes. MVPA was significantly and
inversely associated with all cardio-
metabolic outcomes after adjustment
for the same confounding variables as
shown previously. Time spent seden-
tary was significantly and positively as-
sociated with fasting insulin after ad-
justment for confounders, but not with
any of the other cardiometabolic out-
comes (TABLE 5).
We thereafter modeled the associa-
tions between MVPA with the cardio-
metabolic outcomes after additional ad-
justment for time sedentary and the
covariatesmentionedpreviously(Table5
and eFigure 1A-E, available at http:
//www.jama.com). The associations be-
tween MVPA and all cardiometabolic
outcomes remained statistically signifi-
cant independent of time spent seden-
tary. Conversely, time spent sedentary
was not associated with any of the out-
comes after additional adjustment for
MVPA (Table 5 and eFigure 2A-E).
Meta-regression analysis was used to
examine the sources of heterogeneity
when modeling the association be-
tween time in MVPA and outcome vari-
ables (eFigure 1A-E). When modeling
associations between MVPA and waist
circumference, heterogeneity (I2=93%)
was partly explained by different asso-
ciations between MVPA and waist cir-
cumference across BMI groups (P for
interaction.001).

The combined association analyses
between time spent in MVPA and sed-
entary time with the cardiometabolic
outcomes are shown in FIGURE 1.
Higher levels of MVPA were associ-
ated with significantly lower values of
waist circumference, systolic blood
pressure, fasting insulin and fasting tri-
glycerides, and higher values of HDL
cholesterol across tertiles for seden-
tary time. The differences in out-
comes between higher and lower MVPA
were greater the lower the sedentary
time. The mean differences (95% CI)
between the bottom and top tertiles of
MVPA across sedentary categories var-
ied between 3.6 cm (95% CI, 2.8-4.3
cm) and 5.6 cm (95% CI, 4.8-6.4 cm)
for waist circumference; 0.7 mm Hg
(95% CI, −0.07 to 1.6 mm Hg) and 2.5
mm Hg (95% CI, 1.7 to 3.3 mm Hg) for
SBP; and −2.6 mg/dL (95% CI, −1.4 to
−3.9 mg/dL) and −4.5 mg/dL (95% CI,
−3.3 to −5.6 mg/dL) for HDL choles-
terol. The ratio between bottom and top
tertiles of MVPA across sedentary cat-
egories varied between 1.39 (1.27:
1.53) and 1.71 (1.53:1.91) for insulin,
and 1.15 (1.09:1.21) and 1.27 (1.20:
1.35) for triglycerides, suggesting a 71%
and 27% difference between extreme
MVPA groups for fasting insulin and tri-
glycerides, respectively.
Youth in the top tertile of MVPA ac-
cumulated more than 35 minutes per
day in this intensity level compared
with fewer than 18 minutes per day for
those in the low tertile.
Data on waist circumference were
available from 7 studies (N=6413) at 2
different time points with a median
follow-up time of 2.1 years (range, 0.3-
8.0 years). Neither time in MVPA
( = 0.00024; 95% CI, −0.0057 to
0.0062)norsedentarytime(=−0.0024;
95% CI, −0.0057 to 0.0010) was asso-
ciated with waist circumference at fol-
low-up after adjustment for sex, age,
monitor wear time (min/d), follow-up
time, and baseline waist circumfer-
ence.
We then examined whether base-
line waist circumference was associ-
ated with time spent in MVPA and

(=−0.0037; 95% CI, −0.60 to 0.052).
In contrast, a higher baseline waist

creased time spent sedentary (=0.40;
95% CI, 0.19−0.61) adjusted for sex,
baseline age, baseline sedentary time,
monitor wear time, and follow-up time
(FIGURE 2).
COMMENT
Time spent in MVPA is associated with
multiple cardiometabolic risk factors in-
dependent of time spent sedentary and
other confounding factors. Belonging
to the top tertile for MVPA is associ-
ated with favorable metabolic health re-
gardless of the amount of time spent
sedentary. In contrast, time spent sed-
entary is unrelated to these risk fac-
tors after adjusting for time spent in
MVPA. Neither time spent in MVPA nor
time spent sedentary predicted a higher
waist circumference in prospective
analyses. However, baseline waist cir-
cumference predicted increased time
spent sedentary at follow-up.
Strengths of our study include the
large sample size, which allowed us
to stratify our sample into 9 different

groups with reasonably large samples
in each stratum when examining the
combined associations between time in
MVPA, sedentary time, and cardiometa-
bolic outcomes. Another strength in-
cludes the meta-analyses of 14 indi-
vidual studies, providing more robust
estimates of the observed associa-
tions. Time in MVPA and sedentary
time were measured objectively, reduc-
ing the possibility of misclassification,
and raw individual data files were
cleaned, processed, and reanalyzed in
a standardized manner in all partici-
pants.14
The observational study design lim-
its inferences of causality. However, the
cross-sectional associations between
time in MVPA and the cardiometabolic
risk factors, independent of sedentary
time, were consistent in our meta-
analyses and in the combined associa-
tionanalyses.Itisunlikelythatthemeta-
bolic risk factors lead to lower levels of
physical activity, whereas it is biologi-
cally plausible that physical activity
affects multiple cardiometabolic out-
comes, possibly with the exception of
adiposity. Indeed, results from exer-
ciseinterventionssuggestthatbothmod-

Although we controlled for con-
founding factors, we cannot exclude the
possibility that unmeasured (eg, geno-
type and dietary intake) or poorly mea-
sured confounders explain our obser-
vations. Our intensity threshold for
MVPA (3000 cpm) was higher com-
pared with some other previous stud-
ies in children.10 However, when re-
analyzing our data using a lower
intensity threshold of 2000 cpm, the ob-
servations were materially unchanged
(data not shown).
Previous observations suggest that
overall physical activity and time spent
in MVPA is associated with a more
healthy cardiometabolic profile in
young individuals.9,10,40,41 It has also
been suggested that objectively mea-
sured time spent sedentary is associ-
ated with adiposity8 and insulin resis-
tance12 in children. Further, overall
physical activity measured by acceler-
ometry appears associated with a fa-
vorable cardiometabolic profile inde-
pendent of self-reported time spent
viewing TV.42 The present results ex-
tend previous observations by meta-
analyzing data from as many as 14 dif-
ferent studies and by mutually adjusting
time in MVPA and sedentary time for
each other. Further, the combined as-
sociations analyses consistently con-
firmed that time in MVPA appears more
important than time spent sedentary in
relation to cardiometabolic outcomes
in children.
The magnitude of associations be-
tween time in MVPA and the cardio-
metabolic outcomes were small and
could be considered by some as not
clinically meaningful. A 10-minute dif-
ference in MVPA was associated with
approximately 0.5-cm difference in
waist circumference and approxi-
mately a 1-pmol/L difference in fast-
ing insulin. However, the magnitude of
associations may be underestimated.
This is because physical activity is
highly variable in children, and our
measure of physical activity compris-
ing 5 days on average may not fully re-
flect the true activity levels of the par-
ticipants. The intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC) for within-indi-
vidual differences in accelerometer-
measured physical activity is approxi-
mately0.5.28Assumingallmeasurement
error stems from within-individual vari-
ability, the ICC can be used for mea-
surement error correction by dividing
the regression coefficients by the ICC.43
This suggests that the true magni-

tudes of the associations may be at least
twice as strong as those observed.
Results from the combined analy-
ses were more substantial. Waist cir-
cumference differed by as much as 5.6
cm (95% CI, 4.8-6.4) between those in
the top tertiles for MVPA compared
with those in the bottom tertiles. If this
difference in waist circumference per-
sists into adulthood, it may confer con-
siderable health risks because waist cir-
cumference is linearly associated with
all-cause mortality.44,45 For example, ev-
ery 5-cm increase in waist circumfer-
ence is associated with an increased
relative risk of 17% and 13% for all-
cause mortality in men and women, re-
spectively.44
Further, the differences in cardio-
metabolic risk factors between the
top and bottom tertiles of MVPA
were remarkable similar to the effects
observed from a 12-month high-
intensity exercise intervention in sed-
entary individuals with type 2 diabe-
tes.46 Taken together, this suggests that
the magnitude of differences in cardio-
metabolic risk factors observed be-
tween high- and low-active healthy
youth is clinically significant irrespec-
tive of the amount of time spent sed-
entary.
Moving from the bottom to the top
tertile for MVPA requires an increase
in MVPA of at least 20 minutes per day.
Increasing daily activity at this inten-
sity level can be achieved by partici-
pating in activities such as brisk walk-
ing,jogging,cycling,playingsoccer,and
other team sports.
Our results contradict some previ-
ousobservationsinadultssuggestingthat
objectively measured sedentary time is
associated with metabolic outcomes in-
dependent of time in MVPA.47 When in-
terpreting the differences in results be-
tween studies in children and adults, the
followingshouldbeconsidered:(1)total
physical activity (cpm) is significantly
higherinchildrencomparedwithadults;
(2)differencesinthedefinitionofMVPA
and differences in the relative amount of
time spent sedentary between studies
mayalsocontributetotheconflictingre-
sults; and (3) the between-individual
variability in time in MVPA and time
spent sedentary may vary between chil-
dren and adults.
In contrast to studies in adults,48-50
we were not able to confirm that base-
line time in MVPA or sedentary time
predicted any of the cardiometabolic
outcomes at follow-up. This may be ex-
plained by the generally more healthy
metabolic risk profile in children com-
pared with middle-aged adults. Other
differences include higher overall lev-
els of activity, more time accumulated
in MVPA, and less time spent seden-
tary in children compared with adults.26
Theobservationthatbaselinewaistcir-
cumference predicted time spent seden-
tary at follow-up corroborates studies in
children and adults,51,52 supporting the
hypothesis that the association be-
tween physical activity, sedentary time,
and weight gain may be bidirectional.
Ourresultshaveimplicationsforpub-
lic health policy and physical activity
counselling.Childrenshouldbeencour-
aged to increase their participation in
physical activity of at least moderate
intensityratherthanreducingtheirover-
all sedentary time as this appears more
important in relation to cardiometa-
bolic health. However, our measure of
sedentary time takes into account the
accumulatedtimespentsedentaryrather
than a specific behavior (eg, TV view-
ing). Therefore, decreasing TV time in
youth may still be an important public
health goal as TV viewing may be asso-
ciated with other unhealthy behaviors
such as snacking and soft drink con-
sumption.53,54FurtherTVviewingisalso
associated with exposure to advertise-
ments that often promote unhealthy
dietary habits.55
In conclusion, higher levels of time
in MVPA appear to be associated with
better cardiometabolic risk factors re-
gardless of the amount of time spent
sedentary in youth.
