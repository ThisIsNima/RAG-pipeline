We examined the potential benefits and risks associated with participation in five types of
activities: prosocial (church and volunteer activities), team sports, school involvement,
performing arts, and academic clubs. Our sample included 1,259 mostly European
American adolescents (approximately equal numbers of males and females). First, we
explore the link between involvement in these activities and our indicators of positive and
negative development. Involvement in prosocial activities was linked to positive educa-
tional trajectories and low rates of involvement in risky behaviors. In contrast, participa-
tion in team sports was linked to positive educational trajectories and to high rates of
involvement in one risky behavior, drinking alcohol. Then, we explore two possible
mediators of these associations: peer associations and activity-based identity formation.
The evidence supported our hypothesis that group differences in peer associations and
activity-based identities help explain activity group differences.
The release of A Matter of Time by the Carnegie Corporation of New York
(1992) put the spotlight on the role that productive use of time might play in
successful adolescent development. It illustrated how much discretionary
time adolescents have and how much of this time is spent on unstructured ac-
tivities such as “hanging out” with friends, watching television, and listening
to music. The authors argued that constructive, organized activities would be
a better use of the adolescents’time for the following types of reasons: (a) idle

time is the devil’s playground—doing good things with one’s time takes time
away from opportunities to get involved in risky activities; (b) one can learn
good things while engaged in constructive activities—for example, specific
competencies and prosocial values and attitudes; and (c) involvement in or-
ganized activity settings increases the possibility of establishing positive so-
cial supports and networks. To date, however, there has been relatively little
longitudinal, developmentally-oriented research focused on either the bene-
fits or costs of how adolescents spend their discretionary time. Most of the
relevant research has been done in sociology and leisure studies, with some
recent attention to the benefits of activity involvement growing out of con-
cern with the potential importance of community-service activities for youth
development. In this article, we investigate the longitudinal correlates of ac-
tivity involvement during the high school years. Initially, we report on the
patterns of involvement of high school sophomores to provide a richer pic-
ture of the social life of today’s adolescents. Then, we report on both the
short-term behavioral correlates and the long-term sequelae of engagement
in different types of activities.
Most of the sociological research into the correlates of youth activity
involvement has focused on extracurricular school activities. This research
has documented a link between adolescents’ extracurricular activities and
adult educational attainment, occupation, and income, even after controlling
forsocialclassandability(Landers&Landers,1978;Otto,1975,1976;Otto&
Alwin, 1977). Some of these studies also documented a protective associa-
tion between extracurricular activity participation and involvement in delin-
quent and other risky behaviors (e.g., Landers & Landers, 1978).
Research within leisure studies has taken a slightly different path. In this
area, there have been extensive discussions of the difference between relaxed
leisure and constructive, organized activities. Relaxed leisure is character-
ized as enjoyable, but not demanding (watching TV). Constructive leisure
requires effort and provides a forum in which to express one’s identity or pas-
sion in sports, performing arts, and leadership activities (Agnew & Petersen,
1989; Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Csikszentmihalyi & Kleiber, 1991; Fine,
Mortimer, & Roberts, 1990; Grieves, 1989; Haggard & Williams, 1992;
Kleiber, Larson, & Csikszentmihalyi, 1986; Larson & Kleiber, 1993; Larson &
Richards, 1989). It is often assumed that there are more beneficial develop-
mental outcomes for adolescents associated with constructive leisure than
with relaxed leisure because constructive leisure provides the following
opportunities: (a) to acquire and practice specific social, physical, and intel-
lectual skills that may be useful in a wide variety of settings; (b) to contribute
Eccles, Barber / EXTRACURRICULAR INVOLVEMENT

to the well-being of one’s community and to develop a sense of agency as a
member of one’s community; (c) to belong to a socially recognized and val-
ued group; (d) to establish supportive social networks of both peers and
adults that can help one in both the present and the future; and (e) to experi-
ence and deal with challenges. We know little, however, about the instrumen-
tal role that relaxed and constructive leisure has on adolescent development.
Some recent research indicates positive consequences of participation in
organized activities (e.g., Simmons & Blyth, 1987). For example, Mahoney
and Cairns (1997) and McNeal (1995) found that extracurricular activities
were related to a lower chance of school dropout, particularly during the early
high school years and for high-risk youth. Mahoney (1997) has also shown a
connection to reduced rates of criminal offending. In addition, adolescents
involved in a broad range of adult-endorsed activities report lower rates of
substance use than their noninvolved peers (Youniss, Yates, & Su, 1997).
Sports, relative to other school-based activities such as student government
and academic clubs, have been linked to lower likelihood of school dropout
and higher rates of college attendance (Deeter, 1990; Elliott & Voss, 1974;
Hanks & Eckland, 1978; Holland & Andre, 1987; Howell & McKenzie,
1987; Kirshnit, Ham, & Richards, 1989; McNeal, 1995); this is especially
true for low-achieving and blue-collar male athletes (see Gould & Weiss,
1987; Holland & Andre, 1987; Melnick, Vanfossen, & Sabo, 1988).
Participation in extracurricular activities has also been linked to increases
on indicators of positive development such as self-concept, high school grade
point average (GPA), school engagement, and educational aspirations (Lam-
born, Brown, Mounts, & Steinberg, 1992; Newmann, Wehlage, & Lamborn,
1992; Winne & Walsh, 1980). This is particularly true if one is involved in a
leadership role. Similarly, involvement in high school extracurricular activi-
ties is predictive of several indicators of healthy adult development, includ-
ing active participation in the political process and other types of volunteer
activities, continued sport engagement, and better mental health (DeMartini,
1983; Glancy, Willits, & Farrell, 1986; Youniss, McLellan, Yang, & Yates, in
press; Youniss, McLellan, & Yates, 1997; Youniss, Yates et al., 1997). In con-
trast, sports have also been linked to increased rates of school deviance (Lam-
born et al., 1992).
A third line of research involves studies that focus on the question of
causal direction and selection. For example, Larson (1994) used longitudinal
analyses to study the association between sport participation and delin-
quency. His results suggest that the apparent protective relation of sports to
low rates of delinquency actually reflects the negative impact of delinquency
12
JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT RESEARCH / January 1999

----- Page 4 (native) -----
on sports participation: that is, adolescents engaged in delinquent behaviors
drop out of school athletic participation over time. He found no evidence that
participation in sports led to a decline in engagement in delinquent activities.
In contrast, participation in other youth organizations did predict a decline in
engagement in delinquent activities.
In this article, we examine both the potential benefits (psychological attach-
ment to school, better GPA, lower rates of school absences, and higher rates of
college attendance) and the potential risks (engagement in risky behavior,
including substance use) associated with participation in various forms of con-
structive leisure. Five types of involvement are considered: prosocial (church
and volunteer activities), team sports (any school team), school involvement
(pep club, student council), performing arts (drama, marching band), and
academic clubs (science club, foreign language club). These organized extra-
curricular activities were selected because they require effort and are settings
in which adolescents can express their identities and passions (Csikszentmi-
halyi & Kleiber, 1991). In the first section of the article, we explore the link
between involvement in these types of activities and our indicators of posi-
tive and negative developmental trajectories. To both control for selection
factors and better understand the causal direction of the relation, we use lon-
gitudinal analyses. In the second half of the article, we explore possible rea-
sons for these associations. In this section, we focus on two possible media-
tors: peer associations and activity-based identity formation.
METHOD
Study Design and Sample
The data come from the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transitions
(MSALT). This is a longitudinal study that began (in 1983) with a cohort of
sixth graders drawn from 10 school districts in southeastern Michigan. The
vast majority of the sample is White and comes from working- and middle-
class families living in small industrial cities around Detroit. We have fol-
lowed approximately 1,800 of these youth through eight waves of data begin-
ning in the sixth grade (1983-1984), and continuing into 1996-1997, when
most were 25 to 26. The analyses presented here include 1,259 respondents
who both completed the survey items about activity involvement and had out-
come data from the waves of data collected in 1990-1991 (Wave 6—when
most were 12th graders) and in 1992-1993 (Wave 7).

Measures
The adolescents were administered an extensive interview with items tap-
ping a wide range of constructs. The specific constructs used for the first part
of this article are summarized below.
Activity involvement. In the 10th grade, we collected detailed information
on the adolescents’ involvement in a wide variety of activities in and out of
school. Adolescents were provided with a list of 16 sports and 30 school and
community clubs and organizations. They were asked to check off all activi-
ties in which they participated. We clustered the extracurricular activities into
five categories: prosocial activities—attending church and/or participating
in volunteer and community service-type activities; performance activities—
participating in school band, drama, and/or dance; team sports—participating
in one or more school teams; school involvement—participating in student
government, pep club, and/or cheerleading; and academic clubs—participat-
ing in debate, foreign language, math or chess clubs, science fair, or tutoring
in academic subjects. These categorizations focus on the actual content or
domain of the activity.
Risk behavior. In addition to information on involvement in positive extra-
curricular activities, we also collected detailed information on the adoles-
cents’ involvement in risky/problematic activities in 10th and 12th grades,
such as drinking, getting drunk, skipping school, and using drugs. The risk
behavior measures used the following categories to indicate frequency of
engaging in the activity in the previous 6 months: 1 = none, 2 = once, 3 = 2 to 3
times, 4 = 4 to 6 times, 5 = 7 to 10 times, 6 = 11 to 20 times, and 7 = 21 or more
times. Drinking alcohol at Wave 6 had an extra category, with 7 = 21 to 30
times and 8 = 31 times or more.
Academic outcomes. We also collected data on the students’attachment to
school, using one 7-point item about how much they liked school in both 10th
and 12th grades. In addition, information on academic performance and
assessment test scores was obtained for every participant from their school
files. For these analyses, we use school records of the participants’ cumula-
tive GPAs at the 11th and 12th grades, as well as verbal and numerical ability
subscores on the Differential Aptitude Test (The Psychological Corporation,
1981) administered in the ninth grade. Finally, in our 1992-1993 wave, we
collected college attendance information.

Family characteristics. We included mother’s education as a measure of
family social economic status to use as a control variable in the multiple
regression analyses. This variable was assessed based on the mothers’ ques-
tionnaire collected at the first wave, when the adolescents were in the sixth
grade. Mothers indicated on a 9-point ordinal scale their highest level of edu-
cation with 1 = grade school, 3 = high school diploma, 6 = college degree, and
9 = Ph.D. or other advanced professional degree such as an MD. The modal
responses for this sample were 3 (high school degree, 37.8%) and 4 (some
college or technical school, 34.1%). We then collapsed this scale into a 3-
point ordinal scale with 1 = no more than high school diploma (46.2%), 2 =
some college (38.3%), and 3 = Bachelors’degree or more (15.5%).
Procedure
The data were collected via self-administered questionnaires that were
completed at school during regular school hours. For the 10th- and 12th-
grade waves, the adolescents were released from their classrooms to fill out
the questionnaire in a large common room—usually the lunchroom. In addi-
tion, complete school records from Grade 5 to Grade 12 were collected for all
participants; these included grades, absences, courses taken, and any disci-
plinary measures taken by the schools. The young adult surveys were mailed
to the participants’homes and returned via postage-paid envelopes. On com-
pletion of the survey, participants were sent $20.
RESULTS
Descriptive Patterns
First, we describe the patterns of males and females in activity involve-
ment in the 10th grade. These results are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1
summarizes the distribution of in-school and out-of-school activities by gen-
der, with team sports aggregated into a single category. Table 2 breaks down
the team sports into individual school-based competitive sports teams.
Next, we computed a total number of activities by summing all the in-
school and out-of-school clubs and activities that were checked. On average,
these adolescents participated in between one and two activities and/or clubs.
Females participated at higher rates than males, F(1, 1243) = 25.49, p < .001;
females’mean = 1.79 (SD = 1.71) and males’mean = 1.33 (SD = 1.44). How-

ever, 31% of the sample did not participate in any activities or clubs. Because
sports were so common, we aggregated them separately by summing all of
the different teams checked. Not surprisingly, males participated on more
different teams than females. However, 45% of the sample had not competed
on any school athletic team. Finally, we calculated the breadth of the adoles-
cents’participation by summing the number of different types of activities for
each adolescent (e.g., participation in several different sports, or several dif-
ferent types of clubs, only counted as one type of activity). Females also par-
ticipated in a wider range of activities (mean = 1.54, SD = 1.19), than males
(mean = 1.21, SD = .90; F[1, 1243] = 28.21, p < .001).

Next, we aggregated the adolescents’responses into five broad categories
of activities: prosocial, sports teams, performing arts, school involvement,
and academic clubs. Participants were given a yes score if they had checked
off at least one activity/club within the broad category. A description of par-
ticipation by gender is found in Table 3. Consistent with results reported
above, the males were more likely to engage in at least one sport activity than
were females (F[1, 1243] = 63.72, p < .001). In contrast, the females were
more likely to be involved in prosocial, performing arts, and school involve-
ment activities (F[1, 1243] = 23.71, p < .001; F[1, 1243] = 70.49, p < .001;
and F[1, 1243] = 52.49, p < .001, respectively).
We also assessed whether mother’s education was related to participation
in any of these five general categories. We divided mother’s education into
three categories and ran ANOVAs for each of the activity clusters. The only
significant relation occurred for prosocial activity involvement (F[2, 724] =
9.82, p < .01): Adolescents with mothers having a college degree or higher
were twice as likely (37%) to be involved in prosocial activities as adoles-
cents with mothers having a high school degree or less education (18%);
those with mothers having some college education fell in between (23%).
Trends were evident for both team sports (F[2, 724] = 2.82, p < .06), and per-
forming arts (F[2, 724] = 2.60, p < .08), with 53%, 63% and 58% of adoles-

Concurrent and Long-Term Correlates
In this section, we report on the relation between 10th grade extracurricu-
lar activity involvement and other psychological and behavioral outcomes.
We examine whether specific types of extracurricular activities are more
beneficial or risky than others.
Prosocial activity involvement. Tables 4 and 5 illustrate the findings for
involvement in prosocial activities. Adolescents involved in prosocial activi-
ties in 10th grade reported less involvement in problem behaviors; this differ-
ence is especially marked at Grade 12, 2 years after the activity data were col-
lected. These results suggest that prosocial involvement is a protective factor
with regard to the age-related increases in these risky behaviors. Prosocial
involvement is also linked to better academic performance and greater likeli-
hood of being enrolled full-time in college at age 21.
We tested this hypothesis more directly using longitudinal regression
analysis. The results are shown in Table 6. In each equation, we entered the
10th-grade level of the risky behavior to get an estimate of the extent to which
each of the other predictors explained change in frequency of engaging in the
particular risky behaviors. We also entered gender, mother’s educational
level, and two intellectual aptitude variables (performance on the Differential

these constructs have emerged in other studies as predictors of both academic
achievement and involvement in risky behaviors. Finally, we entered 10th-
grade prosocial activity involvement. The standardized betas for each of
these predictors are included in Table 6 to allow for comparisons of the mag-
nitude of the predictive relationship. As one would expect, the strongest pre-
dictor is the 10th-grade level of involvement in the risky behavior, suggesting
considerable stability in the individual differences in these behaviors over the
high school years. Nonetheless, involvement in prosocial activities is related
to change in this engagement in a protective direction; that is, the students
who are involved in activities such as attending church and doing volunteer
work show less of an increase in these risky behaviors over the high school
years than their noninvolved peers.
Involvement in prosocial activities at Grade 10 is also positively related to
both liking school at that level and a higher GPA at the 12th-grade level. In
addition, being involved in prosocial activities in the 10th grade is positively
related to attending college full-time at age 21. Only the relation to 12th-
grade GPA remained significant in the multiple regression analyses.
Team sports. Tables 4, 5, and 7 show the relation of involvement in team
sports to engagement in risky behaviors. Apparently, involvement in team
sports at Grade 10 is a risk condition for engagement in one of these risky
behaviors at Grade 12; namely, drinking alcohol. When one tests this
hypothesis using the type of longitudinal regression analyses just described
for prosocial activities, being involved with team sports does indeed contrib-
ute significantly to an increase in alcohol use and getting drunk over the high
school years after controlling for mother’s education, student gender, and
intellectual aptitude (see Table 7).
Involvement in team sports also serves as a protective condition for aca-
demic outcomes. Sports participants liked school better at both the 10th and
12th grades. They were also more likely to be attending college full-time at
age 21 than nonparticipants. Finally, sports participation predicted an
increase in liking school between the 10th and 12th grades, a higher than
expected 12th-grade GPA, and a greater than expected likelihood of being
enrolled full-time in college at age 21.
Performing arts. Those adolescents who were involved in performing arts
at Grade 10 were less frequently engaged in risky behaviors at both Grade 10
and 12 than those who were not. This is particularly true for alcohol-related
behaviors (see Tables 4 and 5). However, when one controls for prior levels of
drinking in the longitudinal regression analyses (see Table 8), we could find

no evidence that 10th-grade involvement in performing arts affects the direc-
tion or magnitude of change in drinking behavior over the high school years.
Participation in performing arts was also related to greater liking of school
at both the 10th and 12th grades (see Tables 4 and 5) and to higher 12th-grade
GPA and a greater likelihood of attending college full-time at age 21. The
longitudinal regression analyses suggest that this protective role is only sig-
nificant for 12th grade GPA. The other two longitudinal relations become
nonsignificant once the various control variables are included in the equa-
tion.
Finally, this was the only activity domain in which we found consistent evi-
dence of a gender-by-activity involvement interaction: Males, but not females,
engagedinperformingartswerelesslikelythantheirpeerstodrinkalcoholand
skipschoolinGrade10andtodrinkalcoholinGrade12(p<.01ineachcase).
School-involvement activities. As can be seen in Tables 4 and 5, participation
in school-related clubs and nonathletic activities was not related consistently to
engagement in risky behaviors. In contrast, it was positively related to liking
school at Grade 10 and to both 12th-grade GPA and the likelihood of attending
college full-time at age 21. By and large, these patterns were confirmed in the
longitudinal regression analyses (see Table 9). Participating in these kinds of
school-related activities predicted better than expected 12th-grade GPA and
greater than expected likelihood of attending college full-time at age 21.
Academic clubs. Participation in academic clubs was primarily related to
academic outcomes (see Tables 4, 6, and 10). This was true at both the bivari-
ate and longitudinal multivariate level. Adolescents who participated in aca-
demic clubs had higher than expected high school GPAs and were more
likely to be enrolled in college at 21 than their noninvolved peers.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with the majority of studies, we found clear evidence that par-
ticipation in extracurricular activities during the high school years provides a
protective context in terms of both academic performance and involvement in
risky behaviors. Participation in all five types of extracurricular involvement
predicted better than expected high school GPAs. Participation in sports,
school-based leadership, school-spirit activities, and academic clubs predicted
increased likelihood of being enrolled full-time in college at age 21. Involve-
ment in sports also predicted increases in school attachment. Participation in
prosocial activities was related to lower increases in alcohol and drug use, as

well as to lower levels at both Grades 10 and 12, and participation in perform-
ing arts served this same function for males. Furthermore, each of these
results hold true when social class, gender, and academic aptitude are
controlled.
In contrast, participation in sports is also linked to increases in use of alco-
hol. Contrary to the results reported by Larson (1994), our results provide
good evidence that participation in sports does lead to increases in some
behaviors that might be considered problematic. In addition, our results
clearly support the conclusion that participation in sports has positive aca-
demic consequences. It is likely that the difference in our outcome measures
explains this discrepancy. Larson (1994) used a very global indicator of
delinquency, in which alcohol and drug use was only a small component. His
measure also included no indicators of academic success. In contrast, we
used quite specific outcome measures, and our results indicate that participa-
tion in sports has both positive and potentially negative consequences.
What can we conclude? The evidence presented thus far is mostly consis-
tent with the conclusion reached in the Carnegie Corporation (1992) report, A
Matter of Time. However, the pattern is not as simple as one might expect.
Both the magnitude and the direction of the relations depend on the outcome
being considered and, to some extent, on the gender of the adolescent. For
example, although participation in team sports is related to increased GPA
and increased probability of attending college full-time, it is also related
among males to such risky behaviors as drinking alcohol. Similarly, although
being involved in school spirit and leadership clubs does not appear to reduce
the frequency with which one does risky things such as use drugs, drink alco-
hol, and skip school, it is related in a positive direction to our indicators of
academic success. Only involvement in prosocial activities (in this case, pri-
marily church attendance) appears to be protective against increases in alco-
hol and drug use and increases in skipping school.
Several investigators have offered explanations for these effects. For
example, in 1969, Rehberg suggested five possible mediators for the effects
of sports participation: association with college-oriented peers, exposure to
academic values, enhanced self-esteem, generalization of a high sense of per-
sonal efficacy, and superior career guidance and encouragement. In 1961,
Coleman stressed the values and norms associated with the different peer
clusters engaged in various types of extracurricular activities. Spady (1970)
stressed the benefits in self-esteem one attains from the increases in peer
status associated with successful participation in extracurricular activities.
Otto and Alwin (1977) added skill and attitude acquisition (both interper-
28
JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT RESEARCH / January 1999

----- Page 20 (native) -----
sonal and personal) and increased membership in important social networks
(more recently relabeled social capital by Coleman and Hoffer, 1987).
More recently, investigators have focused on the links between peer group
formation, identity formation, and activity involvement. For example, Fine
(1987) has explored the relation of participating in Little League to both peer
group and identity formation. He has stressed how participation in something
like Little League shapes both children’s self-definition as a “jock” and their
most salient peer group (see also Eccles, 1993; Hantover, 1978; Kirshnit et al.,
1989; Kleiber & Kirshnit, 1990). In turn, these characteristics (one’s identity
and one’s peer group) influence subsequent activity choices—creating a syn-
ergistic system that marks out a clear pathway into a particular kind of adoles-
cence. Similarly, Eckert (1989) has explored the link between peer-group
identity formation and activity involvement. As one moves into and through
adolescence, individuals become identified with particular groups of friends
or crowds (see also Brown, 1990). Being a member of one of these crowds
helps structure both what one does with one’s time and the kinds of values
and norms one is exposed to. Once again, over time, the coalescence of one’s
personal identity, one’s peer group, and the kinds of activities one partici-
pates in as a consequence of both one’s identity and one’s peer group can
shape the nature of one’s pathway through adolescence. Consistent with
these perspectives, we are interested in how activity participation is linked to
both peer group and identity formation. We assume that activity choices are a
part of a larger system of psychological and social forces that influence
development—forces linked to peer group affiliation and identity formation.
Knowing what an adolescent is doing often tells us a lot about who the ado-
lescent is with. Many of the activities we study take up considerable amounts
of the adolescents’time and are done with other adolescents and adults. Thus,
it is likely that participation in some of these activities directly affects adoles-
cents’peer groups precisely because such participation structures a substan-
tial amount of peer group interaction. One’s coparticipants become one’s
peer crowd, and such peer crowds often develop an activity-based culture,
providing adolescents with the opportunity to identify with a group having a
shared sense of style. Similarly, leisure may help to clarify personal identity
while maintaining relationships with peers. Involvement in a school organi-
zation or sport links an adolescent to a set of similar peers, provides shared
experiences and goals, and can reinforce friendships between peers (see also
Larson, 1994). Thus, extracurricular activities can facilitate adolescents’
developmental need for social relatedness and can contribute to one’s iden-
tity as an important and valued member of the school community.

SYNERGISTIC FORCES WITH PEER
GROUP CULTURES AND IDENTITY FORMATION
The ideas outlined above are consistent with the work of Erikson (1968),
and more recently, Adams and Marshall (1996) and Youniss, Yates, and Su
(1997). These scholars suggest that adolescents seek out an identity that
allows them to be actors in their social world and that allows them to feel
effective, successful, and connected in their everyday activities (see also Wil-
liams & McGee, 1991). Extracurricular activities of the kinds we are study-
ing provide youth with the opportunity to form just such identities. In addi-
tion, because participation also influences peer group formation,
participation feeds into the type of synergistic system described above and
depicted in Figure 1.
We explore these ideas in this section. This work represents the begin-
ning of our efforts to explore these issues. In this section, we focus first on
the link between activity participation and peer group characteristics and
then on the link between activity participation and peer-group and activity-
based identities.
METHOD
Additional Measures
Friend characteristics. Composition of the peer network was measured in
10th grade with a series of questions asking “what proportion of your friends
are each of the following?” The items included in these analyses were “plan-
ning to go to college,” “doing very well in school,” “regularly drink alcohol,”
“regularly use drugs,” and “likely to skip class.” The response scale ranged
from 1 = none to 5 = all, with 3 = half.
Identity group. At the 10th grade, we asked the participants to make a pro-
totype judgment regarding their identity. Because the movie The Breakfast
Club (Hughes, 1985) was quite popular at the time, we decided to use it as the
basis of our measure of identity. There are five main characters in this
movie—each one representing a stereotypic adolescent type. We asked the
participants to indicate which of five characters (the princess, the jock, the
brain, the basket case, and the criminal) was most like them. We told them to
ignore the sex of the character and base their selection on the type of person
each character was. The adolescents had no difficulty with their
30
JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT RESEARCH / January 1999

----- Page 22 (native) -----
selection—less than 5% left the question blank. About 9% selected the crimi-
nal, 11% selected the basket case, 12% selected the brain, 28% selected the
jock, and 40% selected the princess. Although the gender distribution was
sex-typed, there were substantial numbers of each sex in each of the given
identity groups to allow for analyses.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Peer Groups
As noted above, activity settings provide a peer group as well as a set of
tasks. To the extent that one spends a lot of time in these activity settings with
the other participants, it is likely that one’s friends will be drawn from among
the other participants. It is also likely that the collective behaviors of this peer
group will influence the behaviors of each member. To the extent that this is
true, some of the behavioral differences associated with activity participation
may be a consequence of the behavioral differences of the peer groups associ-
ated with these different activity clusters.
The relevant results are summarized in Tables 11 and 12. At both 10th and
12th grades, the peer group characteristics were consistent with the outcomes
reported in the first section of this article. This is particularly true at Grade 12.
Consistent with the positive association of activity group membership with
academic outcomes, the peer groups for participants are characterized by a
higher proportion of friends who plan on attending college and are doing well
in school (with the exception of the sports participants). Concordant with the
protective association of prosocial participation with drug and alcohol use,
adolescents involved in prosocial activities, compared to their peers, have
fewer friends who use alcohol and drugs; they also have few friends who skip
school. Finally, congruent with the association of sports participation with
increased drinking, adolescents who participate in team sports have a higher
proportion of friends who drink than their peers.
These results are compatible with the analysis outlined above. Conse-
quently, it is certainly possible that peer group association is one of the
mediators of the association between activity group membership and adoles-
cent outcomes.
Identity Categories
Table 13 summarizes the distributions of identity types for each of our five
activity groups. The significance levels for these one-way ANOVAs are indi-

cated with stars after the activity group. The significant contrasts are summa-
rized in the last column.
One of our activity groups is clearly related to the identity characters:
sports. As one might expect, the jocks stand out in the team sports group. This
is clearly an activity-based identity. The evidence for activity-based identi-
ties is less clear for the other four identities, primarily due to the high propor-
tion of adolescents in all identity groups who participated in at least one team
sport during their 10th grade school year. Ignoring team sports, the princesses
are overrepresented in both the performing arts and school-involved activity
groups, and the brains are overrepresented in the prosocial activity group.
The criminals are characterized by either very low or relatively low participa-
tion in all activity groups except team sports, and the basket cases are charac-
terized by relatively low participation in all groups except the performing
arts.
It is possible that some of the activity group differences on the outcomes
identified in the first part of this article reflect behavioral differences associ-
ated with these different peer-group identity categories.
Tables 14 and 15 summarize the differences between these identity groups
on both the risky behaviors and academic outcomes discussed earlier at both
Grades 10 and 12. As one would expect, the criminal was highest on most of

the risky behaviors, and the brain was the lowest at both grade levels. But con-
sistent with the results reported earlier on the association of activity involve-
ment with drinking behavior, the jocks reported relatively high levels of alco-
hol use at Grade 12. This finding is especially interesting given the stability of
group differences across the 2-year gap between the self-identification as a
criminal or jock and the rating of the risk behaviors. Interestingly, the prin-
cesses also report rather high levels of alcohol use in Grade 12.
Tables 14 and 15 also show the results for the positive academic outcomes.
The expected pattern of results occurred for each of these measures as well:
The brains had the highest rates of college attendance, followed closely, how-
ever, by the princesses and the jocks; the criminals had the lowest. Princesses,
jocks, and brains also reported enjoying school the most at both grade levels.
The results for college attendance are especially interesting, given that this
outcome was measured 4 to 5 years after the self-categorization as a Break-
fast Club stereotype.
These preliminary results suggest that there is a link between identity, pat-
terns of activity involvement, and other indicators of successful and risky
adolescent development. This is most evident in the contrast between the jock
and the criminal. These two groups are doing equally well in school in terms
of their GPAs, and both are equally involved in alcohol consumption at Grade
12. What distinguishes them? The jock has a school-based activity identity
whereas the criminal does not. It is not that the criminal is not involved in
sports; although less likely to be involved in sports than the jocks, 47% of the

criminals were participating in school-based team sports in the 10th grade.
Unfortunately, this changed between 10th and 12th grades. Consistent with
the findings of Larson (1994), 70% of these sports-participating criminals
had dropped out of sports by Grade 12. This represents the largest dropout
rate for all five identity types. Eckert (1989) suggested that one of the key dis-
tinguishing characteristics of the burnouts in her study (a group much like the
groups who labeled themselves the criminal and the basket case in this study)
was the lack of a school-based identity. Over time, this group became increas-
ingly detached from school, leading in many cases to dropping out of high
school prior to graduation. A similar process may be going on for our crimi-
nal group. They also appear to be disconnecting from school and school-
based activities over their high school years and are least likely to graduate
from high school and least likely to be attending college at age 21. Although
not quite so extreme, a similar process may also be going on in our basket
case group.
As noted earlier, it is also likely that the nature of the peers one hangs out
with as result of one’s identity and of one’s activity patterns is a primary
mediator of this link. Table 16 summarizes the identity group differences in
peer network characteristics. Both the criminals and the brains had consistent
profiles of friends. On one hand, the criminals stood out as having the fewest
proportion of friends who were doing well academically and planning to
attend college and the highest proportion of friends engaged in risky behav-
iors. Consequently, it should not be surprising then that this group had the
worst outcomes on both of these sets of outcomes despite the fact that they
were actually doing all right in terms of their own GPAs.
On the other hand, the brains had the highest proportion of friends rated
high on academic outcomes and low on risky behaviors. Consequently, it is not
surprisingthattheseyouththemselveshadthemostconsistentsetofoutcomes.
In contrast, the jocks and princesses had a more mixed pattern in terms of
risks and protective factors. On one hand, the proportion of their friends with
good academic outcomes was about the same as the brains’peer network. On
the other hand, the proportion of their friends who drank and skipped school
was also quite high. This pattern is consistent with the jocks’ own behavior
patterns.
CONCLUSIONS
The analyses reported in the second section represent the beginnings of
our exploration of possible ways that participation in various types of activi-

ties might influence other indicators of adolescent development. In the first
section, we documented a predictive link between activity participation and
increases in both academic outcomes and engagement in risky behaviors. In

the second part, we documented relations among activity participation, peer-
group identity formation, and friendship networks. What can we conclude as
we look across these three aspects of adolescents’ lives? Adolescents who
participated in prosocial activities had the most consistently positive out-
comes—high academic achievement and low rates of involvement in risky
behaviors. They were also the group most likely to identify themselves as
brains and the group who had the most friends who were academic-oriented
and the fewest friends engaged in risky behaviors. These identity and peer
group patterns could help explain why it was only participation in prosocial
activities that served as a protective influence for both sets of outcomes. It is
among this group of adolescents that the three spheres of influence converge
on both positive academic outcomes and low involvement in risky behaviors.
A different pattern of convergence characterized those youth involved in
team sports. For this group, both identity group and peer group were associ-
ated with positive academic outcomes and relatively high levels of alcohol
consumption. This pattern of convergence could help explain why being
involved in team sports is associated with increases in both drinking and aca-
demic achievement.
A less extreme example of this type of convergence was also evident for
those adolescents involved in school-related and school spirit-related
clubs/organizations. This group also exhibited positive academic trajecto-
ries; in addition, however, they were just as likely to drink alcohol as their
nonparticipating peers and showed a trend toward increasing rates of skip-
ping school from the 10th to the 12th grade. They were also the group most

likely to label themselves as princesses, who, in turn, were especially likely
to have a high GPA, to be attending college at age 21, to drink alcohol and
skip school on a fairly regular basis, and to have a substantial proportion of
friends who evidenced the same profile.
Consequently, it should not be surprising that involvement in sports and
school-based/school spirit-related activities was related to a different pattern
of change over the high school years than participating in prosocial activities.
The results for all three of these groups are consistent with the perspective on
synergistic relations among these three domains of adolescent development
outlined earlier and illustrated in Figure 1. Activity choice is likely to both
grow out of and reinforce emerging identities—particularly those aspects of
identity linked to instrumental success and finding one’s place in the social
milieu. Activity choice also channels friendship networks due to propinquity
and to shared interests. Friendship networks further reinforce the value of
various types of activities and identities. Friendship networks also develop
cultures of their own, which set the norms for a wide range of behaviors and
long-term expectations and aspirations, thus influencing adolescents’behav-
iors across several domains (see Brown, 1990; Eckert, 1989; Sherif & Sherif,
1964). Consequently, the patterns of associations of activity participation
with other indicators of adolescent development should depend on the nature
of the peer culture and shared values associated with the groups of adoles-
cents who dominate each activity setting.
Although our results are consistent with this analysis, the results reported
here are basically correlational. In the future, we plan to do the detailed longi-
tudinal causal modeling to verify the directional relations implied in this
analysis. In addition, we will investigate the influences on activity participa-
tion. Given our interest in identity, we will pay particular attention to those
characteristics of the self-system that are likely to influence activity choice,
such as ability self-concept, expectations for success, subjective values,
and perceived norms (see also Ajzen & Driver, 1991; Eccles, 1983; Fish-
bein & Ajzen, 1975). We also have data on the role of family, school, and
elementary school participation patterns as influences on activity choices
during adolescence.
We had a second goal in this article. Information regarding the patterns of
involvement of adolescents in a variety of out-of-school and extracurricular
activities provides us with a more complete picture of the social context of
development during this period. What do adolescents do when they are not in
formal educational or family settings? About 40% of adolescent waking
hours are discretionary (no school, homework, employment, or chores), yet
we know almost nothing about what teenagers do with their leisure time (for

an exception, see Carnegie Corporation, 1992; Larson & Kleiber, 1993). We
need to know more about a wider range of social settings, including athletics,
school clubs and activities, and community service. Consequently, we also
presented the patterns of activity involvement of this sample of adolescents as
important descriptive information about the lives of today’s youth.
The majority of the youth (69%) in this study were involved in some type
of organized activity during their discretionary time. On average, most of the
females were involved with more than one such activity, and most of the
males were involved in less than two such activities. The range of activities
was quite broad, with females exhibiting a more diverse pattern than males.
For both males and females, the three most common activities were team
sports, bands or orchestras, and church, with participation on sports teams
being the most common by a substantial margin. Within sports, males and
females exhibit sex role-stereotyped patterns. It is noteworthy, however, that
the 10th grade males and females in this sample were equally likely to be par-
ticipating on swimming/diving teams and tennis teams, and females were
more likely than males to be participating on softball and volleyball teams.
In conclusion, we have documented the types of activities U.S. adoles-
cents were participating in during the early 1990s. We also documented the
relation of activity participation to indicators of other positive and risky
developmental outcomes. Involvement in prosocial activities was linked to
positive educational trajectories and low rates of involvement in risky behav-
iors. In contrast, participation in team sports was linked to positive educa-
tional trajectories and to high rates of involvement in one type of risky behav-
ior: drinking alcohol. The fact that this activity was associated with both good
educational outcomes and drinking is consistent with other studies reporting
that some involvement in risky activities such as drinking and cutting school
is not necessarily problematic in terms of the consequences for long-term
educational success (Schulenberg, Maggs, & Hurrelmann, 1997). One must
take into account the meaning of the particular behavior in the broader con-
text of the adolescent’s life and development. If the risky behavior takes place
in the context of a group of highly motivated and otherwise mentally healthy
adolescents, it is unlikely that the risky behavior will, in and of itself, have
extremely negative consequences (e.g., drinking among athletes and prin-
cesses). In contrast, if the risky behavior is part of a broader syndrome of
behaviors and disaffection from socially accepted institutional settings such
as schools, then the risky behavior is likely to be prognostic of poor subse-
quent developmental outcomes (Eckert, 1989; Jessor & Jessor, 1977).
