Abstract
The Rotterdam Study is a prospective cohort
study ongoing since 1990 in the city of Rotterdam in the
Netherlands. The study targets cardiovascular, neurologi-
cal, ophthalmological and endocrine diseases. As of 2008
about 15,000 subjects aged 45 years or over comprise the
Rotterdam Study cohort. The ﬁndings of the Rotterdam
Study have been presented in some 600 research articles
and reports (see http://www.epib.nl/rotterdamstudy). This
article gives the reasons for the study and its design. It also
presents a summary of the major ﬁndings and an update of
the objectives and methods.

Introduction
The Rotterdam Study was designed in the mid-1980s as a
response to the demographic changes that were leading to
an increase of the proportion of elderly people in most
populations [1]. It was clear that this would produce a
strong rise in elderly people living with diseases, as most
diseases cluster at the end of life, and that to discover the
causes of diseases in the elderly one would have to study
risk factors of those diseases [2]. A major approach to
ﬁnding causes is the prospective follow-up study, which
has proven quite effective in ﬁnding causes of heart disease
and cancer. Remarkably, in the 1980s there were hardly
any follow-up studies focussing on the elderly.
The design of the Rotterdam Study
The basic design of the study was straight-forward: a
prospective cohort study among 7,983 persons living in the
well-deﬁned Ommoord district in the city of Rotterdam in
the Netherlands (78% of 10,215 invitees). They were all
55 years of age or over and the oldest participant at the
start was 106 years [3]. The study started with a pilot phase
in the second half of 1989. From January 1990 onwards
participants were recruited for the Rotterdam Study. Fig-
ure 1 gives a diagram of the various cycles of the study.
In 1999, 3,011 participants (out of 4,472 invitees) who
had become 55 years of age or moved into the study dis-
trict since the start of the study were added to the cohort.
In 2006, a further extension of the cohort was initiated in
which about 6,000 subjects aged 45–54 years, living in the
Ommoord district, were invited (expected number of par-
ticipants about 4,000). By the end of 2008, the Rotterdam
Study is therefore expected to comprise about 15,000
subjects aged 45 years or over.

The participants were all examined in some detail at
baseline. They were interviewed at home (2 h) and then
had an extensive set of examinations (a total of 5 h) in a
specially built research facility in the centre of their dis-
trict. These examinations focussed on possible causes of
invalidating diseases in the elderly in a clinically state-of-
the-art manner, as far as the circumstances allowed. The
emphasis was put on imaging (of heart, blood vessels,
eyes, skeleton and later brain) and on collecting bodily
ﬂuids that enabled further in-depth molecular and genetic
analyses. These examinations were repeated every 3–
4 years in characteristics that could change over time.
And so we had examination cycles from 1990 to 1993,
from 1993 to 1995, from 1997 to 1999, from 2000 to
2001, from 2002 to 2004, from 2004 to 2005 and from
2006 to 2008 (Fig. 1).
The participants in the Rotterdam Study are followed for
a variety of diseases that are frequent in the elderly (and
many are also in the not so elderly): coronary heart disease,
heart failure and stroke, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer
disease and other dementias, depression and anxiety dis-
orders, macular degeneration and glaucoma, diabetes
mellitus and osteoporosis.
The Rotterdam Study has been approved by the insti-
tutional review board (Medical Ethics Committee) of
the Erasmus Medical Center and by the review board of the
Netherlands Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports. The
approval
has
been
renewed
every
5 years.
Separate
approval has been obtained for the introduction of major
new elements in the study (e.g. MRI investigations).
In the remainder of this article the objectives and major
ﬁndings will be presented with an update of the methods
for cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, oph-
thalmologic
diseases,
psychiatric
diseases,
endocrine
diseases, as well as for genetic and for pharmaco-epide-
miologic studies.
Cardiovascular diseases
Objectives
Research on the epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases
focuses on three primary areas of interest: studies on risk
factors for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease,
studies on the detection of subjects at high risk of coronary
heart disease, and studies on cardiovascular conditions in
older age.
Two groups of putative risk factors for atherosclerosis
and coronary heart disease are included. The ﬁrst are
endocrine factors, including estrogens and androgens,
insulin and insulin-like growth hormone I, and thyroid
gland and adrenal gland hormones. The second group
contains factors involved in haemostasis, inﬂammation and
endothelial function. Research also focuses on genetic
factors in these areas in relation to risk of coronary heart
disease.
The ability of classical cardiovascular risk factors to
identify subjects at high risk of coronary heart disease is
limited. Risk stratiﬁcation may be improved when based on
the presence of atherosclerosis. To this end, repeated
measurements of non-coronary atherosclerosis and mea-
surements of coronary, carotid and aortic arch calciﬁcation
have been included in the study.
Another line of research focuses on cardiovascular dis-
eases in the elderly that are in large part the consequence of
ischemic heart disease, like heart failure and atrial ﬁbril-
lation. An important topic in this area is the early diagnosis
of heart failure using echocardiographic assessment of
asymptomatic systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the left
ventricle. Atrial ﬁbrillation is another major chronic con-
dition
frequent
at
older
age.
Examination
of
the
determinants and prognosis of atrial ﬁbrillation is part of
this research line.
Major ﬁndings
Findings on determinants of atherosclerosis and coronary
heart disease include the relation between hypothyroidism

and myocardial infarction [4] and the association of genetic
variation in the estrogen receptor alpha gene with risk of
myocardial infarction in women [5]. The study demon-
strated that high levels of CRP [6] and lipoprotein-
associated phospholipase A2 activity [7] were associated
with risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Genetic
ﬁndings in this area include a positive association of cor-
onary
heart
disease
with
genetic
variation
in
the
complement factor H gene [8] but not with variation in the
CRP gene [6].
The study showed that carotid intima-media thickness
and plaques measured by ultrasound, the ankle-arm index,
and aortic calciﬁcation detected by X-ray are independent
predictors of risk of coronary heart disease [9]. The study
also showed that vessel wall stiffness, as measured by
aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), improved prediction of
cardiovascular disease beyond the classical risk factors
[10]. The Rotterdam Study was the ﬁrst to publish results
from population-based research on the predictive value for
coronary heart disease of coronary calciﬁcation assessed by
electron-beam CT [11].
The study enabled accurate assessment of the incidence
and lifetime risk of heart failure and atrial ﬁbrillation in an
elderly population [12, 13]. It was shown that atheroscle-
rosis
and
inﬂammation
are
also
involved
in
these
conditions [14, 15].
Methods update
Repeated measures of non-coronary atherosclerosis inclu-
ded
carotid
intima-media
thickness
and
plaques
by
ultrasound, the ankle-arm index and aortic calciﬁcation by
X-ray [9]. Electron-beam CT and multi-detector CT were
used to accurately quantify calciﬁcation in the coronary,
aortic arch and carotid arteries [11]. In the second addi-
tional cohort of the Rotterdam Study (RS Young1, see
Fig. 1), the measurement of plaque vulnerability with high-
resolution MRI of the carotid arteries will be added. Other
outcome measures include electrocardiography, echocar-
diography and measures of vessel wall stiffness (PWV and
carotid distensibility) [10].
Determinants were assessed by physical examinations,
collection of blood samples, and by questionnaires and
interview. The role of genetic factors is studied using the
candidate gene approach and more recently the genome
wide association study.
Clinical cardiovascular outcomes are collected during
our continuous follow-up and include non-fatal myocardial
infarction and cardiac death, revascularizations, heart
failure and atrial ﬁbrillation. The methods of diagnosis
of these outcomes have been described in previous papers
[6, 12, 13].
Neurological diseases
Objectives
Neuroepidemiologic research in the Rotterdam Study
focuses on the frequency, etiology and early recognition of
the most frequent neurologic diseases in the elderly,
including dementia (in particular Alzheimer disease), Par-
kinson disease and stroke. In neurodegenerative and
cerebrovascular
disorders
clinical
symptoms
typically
become manifest late in the disease course, the occurrence
of clinical disease does not reﬂect the underlying spectrum
of disease-related pathology, and most of the clinical
syndromes are etiologically heterogeneous. Therefore, an
additional research focus is on the causes and conse-
quences of pre-symptomatic brain pathology that can be
assessed with non-invasive imaging modalities.
Major ﬁndings
Neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases are highly
frequent in the elderly. The prevalence increases from age
55 to 65 years to age 90 years and above from less than 1%
to over 40% for dementia [16], from less than 0.5% to more
than 4% for Parkinson disease [17], and from approxi-
mately 1% to nearly 10% for stroke. The incidence ﬁgures
follow this pattern of a strong increase with age over the
entire age range, with the age-speciﬁc incidence of
dementia being identical for men and women at least until
the age of 85 [18] but with men having a higher age-
speciﬁc incidence of both stroke and Parkinson disease
than women throughout the age range [19, 20].
Vascular pathology and vascular risk factors are asso-
ciated with worse cognitive performance [21], which also
translates in people with vascular pathology or risk factors
for vascular disease having an increased risk of dementia,
including Alzheimer disease [22]. Moreover, several life
style factors are associated with the risk of dementia and
Alzheimer disease [23–25], suggesting that onset of
dementia may at least partly be delayed or prevented.
Commonly used drugs may have a role in this [26].
The classical risk factors for stroke also predict risk of
stroke in the Rotterdam Study [27]. More recently identiﬁed
risk factors, including inﬂammatory markers, may be etio-
logically relevant but thus far add little to the identiﬁcation of
people at risk [28]. Possibly underlying this is that a large
amount of stroke goes clinically undetected [29]. Nearly
20% of elderly people have at least one silent brain infarct,
and thereby a nearly fourfold increased risk of clinical stroke,
a more than doubled risk of dementia including Alzheimer
disease, and an increased risk of depression [29].
Neuroimaging reveals that brain pathology is wide-
spread [30] and can go clinically undetected for a long

time. In addition to the silent infarcts, many apparently
healthy elderly have ischemic changes in their cerebral
white matter that are associated with an increased risk of
dementia, stroke and depression [31]. Also brain atrophy,
especially of the hippocampus, is already present years
before onset of even the earliest sign of cognitive impair-
ment or subjective complaints [32]. This emphasizes the
need to shift the attention in etiologic research of neuro-
degenerative and cerebrovascular disease to the causes of
pre-symptomatic and underlying brain changes.
Methods update
Assessment of dementia and Alzheimer disease
In the baseline and follow-up examinations participants
undergo an initial screen for dementia with the Mini Mental
State Examination (MMSE) and the Geriatric Mental Sche-
dule (GMS), followed by an examination and informant
interview with the Cambridge Examination for Mental Dis-
orders of the Elderly (CAMDEX) in screenpositives (MMSE
\26 or GMS [0), and subsequent neurological, neuropsy-
chological and neuroimaging examinations [16, 18]. Of
subjects who cannot be reexamined in person, information is
obtained from the GPs and the regional institute for outpatient
mental health care. A consensus panel makes the ﬁnal diag-
noses in accordance with standard criteria (DSM-III-R
criteria; NINCDS-ADRDA; NINDS-AIREN).
Assessment of parkinsonism and Parkinson disease
Participants are screened in the baseline and follow-up
examinations for cardinal signs of parkinsonism (resting
tremor,
rigidity,
bradykinesia
or
impaired
postural
reﬂexes). Persons with at least one sign present are
examined with the Uniﬁed Parkinson Disease Rating Scale
and a further neurologic exam. Parkinson disease is diag-
nosed if two or more cardinal signs are present in a subject
not taking antiparkinsonian drugs, or if at least one sign has
improved through medication, and when all causes of
secondary parkinsonism (dementia, use of neuroleptics,
cerebrovascular disease, multiple system atrophy or pro-
gressive supranuclear palsy) can be excluded [17, 19].
Assessment of stroke and stroke subtypes
History of stroke at baseline was assessed through inter-
view and veriﬁed in medical records. Putative incident
strokes get identiﬁed through the linkage of the study
database
with
ﬁles
from
general
practitioners,
the
municipality, and nursing home physicians’ ﬁles, after
which additional information (including brain imaging) is
collected from hospital records. A panel discusses all
potential strokes and subclassiﬁes strokes into ischemic,
hemorrhagic or unspeciﬁed [20, 28].
Assessment of cognitive function
Global cognitive function is measured through the Mini
Mental State Examination (MMSE) in all surveys. From
the third survey onwards we added a 30 min test battery
that was designed to assess executive function and memory
function, and which includes a Stroop test, a Letter Digit
Substitution Task, a Word Fluency Test, and a 15 words
Word List Learning test.
Rotterdam Scan Study: brain imaging within the Rotterdam
Study
In 1991, a random sample of 111 participants underwent
axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to
assess presence and severity of white matter lesions [33]. In
1995, a random sample of 563 non-demented participants
underwent brain MR imaging in the context of the Rotterdam
Scan Study. The scanning protocol included series of axial
proton-density, T2-weighted and T1-weighted images, as
well as a high-resolution 3D-HASTE sequence [31]. From
August 2005 onwards, a dedicated 1.5 Tesla scanner is
operational in the research centre of the Rotterdam Study,
and brain imaging is performed in all study participants
without contra-indications. The scanning protocol includes 4
high-resolution axial sequences (3D T1-weighted; 2D PD-
weighted; 2D FLAIR; and 3D T2* GRE), 2D phase-contrast
imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Psychiatric diseases
Objectives
The aim of the psychiatric research in the Rotterdam Study is
to investigate the determinants, correlates and consequences
of common psychiatric problems in the elderly. The focus
has been on depressive disorders but anxiety disorders, sleep
disturbances and complicated grief are also being studied.
Major ﬁndings
The one-month prevalence of both major and minor
depression at baseline was 1.5%, the prevalence of anxiety
disorder was 8.2%.
822

We found evidence for the vascular depression hypothe-
sis. More severe coronary and extra-coronary atherosclerosis
were associated with a higher prevalence of depression, as
were cerebral haemodynamic changes[34,35]. However, we
could not rule out that earlier depressive episodes may have
contributed to the development of atherosclerosis. More-
over, our data did not support a speciﬁc symptom proﬁle of
vascular depression as previously deﬁned [36].
Most of our studies of nutritional and metabolic factors
provided no support for an etiological role in depression.
Folate deﬁciency, homocysteine, fatty acid ratio (omega-6/
omega-3) and vitamin E had little or no effect on the risk of
depression after control for health and health related
behaviour [37–39]. In contrast, low levels of vitamin B12
and high levels of inﬂammatory protein IL-6 convey a
strong risk for depression, although the latter effect may be
conﬁned to high-risk groups [40].
Several SNPs have been investigated, mostly with
negative results. However, we found that an ER-alpha
polymorphism had a substantial effect on anxiety but not
on depression in women [41].
Methods update
In the ﬁrst years of the Rotterdam Study psychiatric data
collection was very limited. However, from the third
examination onwards, which began in 1997 (see Fig. 1),
depressive symptoms and disorders are have been ascer-
tained in all participants. The 4,603 participants with valid
depression scores in this examination thus constitute the
baseline population for longitudinal studies of depression.
Because assessment of anxiety disorders, sleeping distur-
bances and complicated grief were added in the fourth
examination, they can currently be studied only cross-
sectionally.
Assessment of determinants
Psychiatric research in the Rotterdam Study focuses on
biological risk factors. The vascular depression hypothesis
was tested with different measures of atherosclerosis,
arterial stiffness and cerebral blood ﬂow [34, 35]. We also
examined whether blood levels of vitamins and fatty acids,
immune parameters, and markers of folate metabolism
increased the likelihood of depression [37–40]. In one
ongoing project, diurnal patterns of cortisol secretion are
related to psychiatric and other disorders. Studies of
genetic polymorphisms and brain morphology are under-
way. Current data collection includes a dexamethasone
suppression test to measure hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis activity in all participants, which is unique in a pop-
ulation-based study.
Assessment of outcomes
Depression is assessed using a two step procedure. First,
participants
completed
the
Center
for
Epidemiologic
Studies Depression scale (CES-D) during the home inter-
view to measure self-reported depressive symptoms [42].
As a second step, screen positive subjects, who scored
above a well-established CES-D cut-off of 20 points, have
a psychiatric interview using the Present State Examination
(PSE/SCAN) [43]. This semi-structured interview is con-
ducted by a clinician and yields DSM-IV diagnoses
including major and minor depression and dysthymia.
The following anxiety disorders are assessed with a
slightly adapted Munich version of the Composite Inter-
national
Diagnostic
Interview:
generalized
anxiety
disorder, speciﬁc and social phobia, agoraphobia without
panic disorder, and panic disorder [44]. Sleep quality and
disturbance is measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index. In addition, sleep duration and fragmentation are
assessed with actigraphy, a method that infers wakefulness
and sleep from the presence or absence of limb movement
[45]. The Inventory of Complicated Grief is used to iden-
tify traumatic grief [46]. This is a condition distinct from
normal grief and bereavement-related depression, charac-
terized by symptoms like disbelief about the death and
searching for the deceased.
Ophthalmologic diseases
Objectives
The primary objectives of the ophthalmological part of the
Rotterdam Study are to study frequency and risk factors of
common and invalidating eye diseases with emphasis on
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and primary
open angle glaucoma (POAG). Another line of research
focuses on the associations between retinal vessel abnor-
malities and cardiovascular and neurologic diseases.
Major ﬁndings
AMD was the main cause of blindness in the high age-
group [47]. Major risk factors that were found for AMD are
smoking, atherosclerosis, hyperopia [48–50]. The APO-E
e-4 allele showed an inverse association with AMD [51].
First-degree relatives of patients with late ARM developed
ARM at an increased rate at a relatively young age [52].
The heterogeneity of genetic risk among AMD families is
considerable, and the proportion of high-risk families is
relatively small [53]. The anticipated protective effect of
cholesterol-lowering
drugs
on
AMD
could
not
be

substantiated [54]. A protective effect on AMD was dem-
onstrated in participants using a diet rich of antioxidants
and zinc intake in our study population. Support for a
multifactorial origin of AMD was found in the cumulative
effects of aberrant CFH and CRP genes, inﬂammations and
smoking as genetic and environmental stimulators of the
complement cascade [55].
The prevalence estimates of POAG in Rotterdam was
highly dependent on the applied criteria [56]. That was a
major reason for proposing a classiﬁcation system without
ﬁnal, subjective adjudication [57]. Systemic blood pressure
and hypertension were associated with elevated intraocular
pressure but not with prevalent POAG [58]. Relatives of
patients with POAG have a strongly increased risk of
glaucoma. Enlarged cup-disc ratio was the earliest and
most prominent feature of familial aggregation [59]. The
incidence of OAG rises signiﬁcantly with age. Most of the
patients with incident OAG were unaware of having OAG
[60]. The incidence of visual ﬁeld loss rises ﬁvefold
between 55 and 80 years to 20/1,000 person years in the
general population [61]. Glaucoma is the main cause for
visual ﬁeld loss, followed by stroke [62].
Larger retinal venular diameters are associated with
generalized atherosclerosis, inﬂammation and cholesterol
levels. Retinal venular diameters are variable and may
play their own independent role in predicting cardiovas-
cular disorders [62]. Dilated retinal venules at baseline
were predictive for stroke, cerebral infarction, dementia,
white brain matter lesions, impaired glucose tolerance,
diabetes mellitus and mortality [63, 64]. In systemic
hypertension, the arteriolar diameters are narrow and
arteriolar and venular narrowing precedes the onset of
hypertension [65].
Methods update
Repeated ophthalmic measurements include best corrected
ETDRS visual acuity, refractive error, Goldmann appla-
nation tonometry, keratometry, slitlamp examination of the
anterior segment and visual ﬁeld testing. In pharmacolog-
ical mydriasis we make colour photographs of the lens, 35
degree photography of the macular area, and simultaneous
stereoscopic imaging of the optic disc and macular area.
Digital photography of the macular area and optic disc are
added since the fourth follow-up examination. Scanning
laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT II) measurements of the optic
disc, macular pigment density measurements and optical
coherence tomography of the macular area and optic disc
were added during follow-up.
For the assessment of AMD we use stereoscopic 35
macular images centred on the fovea. The images are
graded according to the International Classiﬁcation and
Grading System for AMD [66].
The procedure for assessing POAG includes Goldmann
applanation tonometry, visual ﬁeld screening, ophthal-
moscopy and stereoscopic fundus photography [57].
Assessment of retinal vascular diameters is done by
analyses of digitized fundus transparencies with a semi
automated system [58, 67].
Genetic studies
Objectives
The ﬁrst objective of the laboratory team is to collect, store
and manage the biological tissues sampled in the Rotter-
dam Study. The second objective of the group concerns
genotyping and assessment of biomarkers.
Major ﬁndings
Both from biomarker studies as well as molecular genetic
studies important ﬁndings have emerged. For example,
among the biomarker analyses the study documenting the
relationship between homocysteine and osteoporosis has
been novel [68] and since widely replicated. Several can-
didate gene studies have also yielded major new insights
coming from both exploratory studies as well as from
collaborative replication efforts across all disease-oriented
research lines in the Rotterdam Study. A unique feature of
the Rotterdam Study is exploited by studying the rela-
tionship between pleiotropic gene variants and not one but
multiple
diseases
and
disease-related
endpoints.
For
example, the studies on the promoter region of the IGF-1
gene revealed a series of consistent associations ranging
from birth weight to diabetes [69], while other consistent
associations involve the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1)
gene in relation to osteoporosis [70], osteoarthritis, height,
myocardial
infarction
[5],
age-at-menopause,
and
depression.
The Rotterdam Study is involved as a major collabora-
tive centre for studies for novel genes coming from
genome-wide analysis (GWA) studies, including CFH in
age-related macula degeneration [71], NOS1AP in QT
interval [72], and several SNPs involved in height, type 2
diabetes, and breast cancer. Finally, Rotterdam Study
investigators play a leading role in the emerging large
global consortia focussing on the contribution of complex
disease gene variants by prospective meta-analyses across
many epidemiological cohorts, such as for osteoporosis in
the GENOMOS Study and EUROSPAN.

Methods update
Data collection, storage and management
At each examination, blood, serum, plasma (citrate, hep-
arine and EDTA based), sputum, and urine are collected.
Fasting blood samples are collected along with challenged
samples as part of a glucose tolerance test. Sputum is
collected before and after a dexamethasone-suppression
test. Sputum is frozen at –196C before and after the
challenge and stored at –80C. To obtain serum and
plasma, tubes are centrifuged according to a protocol
standardising time and conditions from the drawing of
blood to centrifugation. All samples are snap frozen at –
196C using liquid nitrogen and stored at –80C. RNA is
isolated from blood within 5 h after sampling and stored at
–20C. DNA is isolated from blood and extraction has been
recently automated using a Hamilton STAR pipetting
platform and AGOWA magnetic bead technology. DNA
sample storage is in Matrix 2D-barcode tubes in 96-well
format. Overnight urine samples are collected, frozen at –
196C and stored at –80C. For data management, an in-
house customized laboratory management system has been
developed. Sample retrieval will be automated with an in-
house customized laboratory track and trace system.
Blood assessments
For all participants, serum cholesterol, HDL, LDL, tri-
glycerides, glucose and glucose levels are assessed. In
urine, micro albumin and creatinine are determined in all
participants. There have been a large number of speciﬁc
blood/serum/plasma-based biomarker assessments includ-
ing steroids (e.g. estrogens, androgens, vitamin D, cortisol),
interleukins, CRP, IGF1, insulin, iron-parameters (iron,
ferritin and transferrin saturation), ﬁbrinogen, homocyste-
ine, folic acid, riboﬂavine, pyridoxine, SAM/SAH ratio,
cobalamine, Lp-PLA2, Fas/Fas-L, vitamins, a-beta42/40
and thyroid hormones (TSH).
Genotyping facilities
Afﬁliated laboratory facilities include a medium/high-
throughput platform for candidate gene studies and genome
wide association (GWA) analyses. The facilities use high-
end automated machinery including a Caliper/Zymark
ALH 3000 pipetting robot (including a TwisterII, and
integrated plate sealer, plate reader (OD 260/280), a Tecan
EVO 150 Freedom pipetting robot, a Deerac Equator
NS808 nanoliter liquid dispenser, 15 electronic PCR
machines (ABI 9700, 2 · 384), an ABI7900HT Taqman
machine (running 1 ng gDNA in 2 ll reactions), a WAVE
3500HT dHPLC, and two ABI3100 sequencing machines.
DNA sample handling is centred on 384-well plates.
Candidate gene studies are done mostly using Taqman
genotyping with throughputs at 30,000 genotypes per day.
Continuous efforts are focussed on reducing the required
amount of genomic DNA, which is now down to 1 ng per
genotype. Genome-wide genotyping studies are based on
500/1,000 K Affymetrix arrays and 317, 550 and 1,000 K
Illumina arrays with throughputs at 100–300 arrays per
week.
The genotyping facility has been partly sponsored by
NWO investment grants (911-03-012; 175.010.2005.011),
is part of the ErasmusMC Biomics core facility, and serves
as knowledge centre for polymorphism analysis attracting
national and international interested parties, both academic

Candidate gene studies
We have genotyped [200 polymorphisms across the
complete cohort and conducted a large number of candi-
date gene studies in the Rotterdam Study. These mostly
concern individual potentially functional single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) per gene, but sometimes also hap-
lotype
tagging
SNPs
(e.g. ESR1,
ESR2,
HSD11B1,
ﬁbrinogen), and also high-density SNP screening (e.g. the
vitamin D receptor gene [73]). The candidate genes studied
include the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), the angioten-
sin-converting
enzyme
(ACE),
the
gene
encoding
angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin II type 1 receptor
(AT1R) gene, G protein beta3 (GNB3), adducine gene,
Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP), Hepatic Lipase,
Phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), ALOX5AP encoding 5-
lipoxygenase activating protein, a polymorphism in the
regulatory region of the Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-
1) gene, the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene, Complement
factor H gene (CFH), and several polymorphisms in genes
from the estrogen-, thyroid-, cortisol-, vitamin D-, IGF-,
and Wnt-signalling pathways, the homocysteine pathway,
and several matrix molecules.
Genome wide association (GWA) studies
A recently developed approach to identify robust genetic
factors for complex disease is the Genome Wide Associ-
ation (GWA) analysis. This is based on genotyping
epidemiological cohorts with ultra-high density SNP arrays
with up to 1 million SNPs. The method has already been
shown to successfully identify genetic factors for several
traits
and
diseases
including
age-related
macula

degeneration, inﬂammatory bowel disease, body mass
index, type 2 diabetes and breast cancer. Through a large
grant from the Dutch research organization NWO one of
the world’s largest GWA studies is conducted involving
10,000 DNA samples from the Rotterdam Study. This
GWA is based on the Illumina 550 K arrays and ﬁnished
by the end of 2007. The GWA data will be useful for all
research lines within the Rotterdam Study, and will also
serve as a control GWA dataset for other research centres
in and outside the Netherlands for both SNP frequencies as
well as copy number variations (CNVs). In addition to this,
a pilot study has been performed on 500 women from the
Rotterdam Study using the Affymetrix 500 K platform
allowing direct platform comparisons and merging of data
to further increase genome coverage. In addition, our group
has been active in developing new software for GWA
analyses [74].
Pharmaco-epidemiologic studies
Objectives
A major objective of the pharmaco-epidemiologic studies is
to investigate the role of drugs as determinants of disease in
the Rotterdam Study. This includes studying efﬁcacy and
effectiveness of drugs, as well as adverse reactions to drugs.
Major ﬁndings
Important ﬁndings have been published on pharmaco-epi-
demiological topics concerning the main outcomes in the
Rotterdam Study. Studies about the association between
dementia and antihypertensive drugs [75] and NSAIDs [26]
have strongly suggested a protective effect of both groups of
drugs. Several studies have been performed on cardiovas-
cular topics [76–78]. In one of these studies, NSAIDs were
associated with an increased risk of heart failure [79]. In line
with the suspicion that QTc-prolonging drugs may cause
sudden cardiac death, it was demonstrated in the Rotterdam
Study that a prolonged QTc is indeed an important risk factor
[77]. Furthermore, in one study it was demonstrated that
high-dose corticosteroids increase the risk of atrial ﬁbrilla-
tion [78]. In the important area of locomotor diseases, studies
have demonstrated that thiazide diuretics protect against hip
fracture [79] and that statins reduce the risk of vertebral
fracture [80]. On the other hand, the risk that long-term use of
certain NSAIDs may aggravate signs of osteoarthritis has
been emphasized [81]. In the area of ophthalmological dis-
eases, a protective effect of cholesterol-lowering agents on
macular degeneration has been suggested [82]. In other
areas, such as pharmacogenetics and other causes of
interactions between drugs, several important ﬁndings have
been published [83–91].
Methods update
For several reasons, a drug is a highly attractive determi-
nant in clinical epidemiology. First, drugs are probably the
most important therapeutic intervention in health care.
Despite rigorous clinical research before registration, many
important effects of drugs are discovered after marketing.
Second, all marketed drugs have proven biological activity,
meaning that it concerns a determinant which really mat-
ters. Third, and as a consequence of the availability of
complete medication histories in Dutch health care, the role
of drug exposure can be assessed in a detailed way.
In the Rotterdam Study, there is an almost complete
coverage of the population as of 1 January, 1991 thanks to
the fact that all pharmacies which serve the Ommoord
region are on one computer network. To date, almost
3 million prescriptions have been delivered to the popula-
tion of the Rotterdam Study and of each prescription,
details are available about the product name and contents,
ATC-code, dosage and duration of drug therapy.
Drugs are a group of determinants, which can be studied
in association with a large variety of diseases. In the Rot-
terdam Study, there is a strong interest in the association
between
drugs
and
the
cardiovascular,
neurological,
endocrinological and ophthalmological diseases, which
have been the main topics since starting. However, there is
also important information about the association with
psychiatric diseases, cancer, and chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease. Moreover, important information about
secondary outcomes, such as drug blood levels, other lab-
oratory
information,
and
information
about
hospital
discharge diagnoses, is gathered on a continuous basis to
facilitate pharmaco-epidemiological studies.
Management of the Rotterdam Study
The Rotterdam Study is directed by a Management Team
comprising Jan Heeringa, MD, study coordinator, Eric
Neeleman, head IT, Frank van Rooij, head data-manage-
ment, and the scientiﬁc principal investigators Albert
Hofman (PI Rotterdam Study, chairman), Monique Bret-
eler (PI Neurological diseases), Cornelia van Duijn (PI
Genetic studies), Gabriel Krestin (PI Radiology), Huibert
Pols (PI Endocrinology), Bruno Stricker (PI Pharmaco-
epidemiology), Henning Tiemeier (PI Psychiatric dis-
eases), Andre´ Uitterlinden (PI Genome wide analysis),
Johannes Vingerling (PI Ophthalmologic diseases) and
Jacqueline Witteman (PI Cardiovascular diseases).
