Adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) is the major energy currency of
cells and is involved in many cellular processes. However, there is
no method for real-time monitoring of ATP levels inside individual
living cells. To visualize ATP levels, we generated a series of
ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based indicators for
ATP that were composed of the  subunit of the bacterial FoF1-ATP
synthase sandwiched by the cyan- and yellow-ﬂuorescent pro-
teins. The indicators, named ATeams, had apparent dissociation
constants for ATP ranging from 7.4 M to 3.3 mM. By targeting
ATeams to different subcellular compartments, we unexpectedly
found that ATP levels in the mitochondrial matrix of HeLa cells are
signiﬁcantly lower than those of cytoplasm and nucleus. We also
succeeded in measuring changes in the ATP level inside single HeLa
cells after treatment with inhibitors of glycolysis and/or oxidative
phosphorylation, revealing that glycolysis is the major ATP-gen-
erating pathway of the cells grown in glucose-rich medium. This
was also conﬁrmed by an experiment using oligomycin A, an
inhibitor of FoF1-ATP synthase. In addition, it was demonstrated
that HeLa cells change ATP-generating pathway in response to
changes of nutrition in the environment.

A
denosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) is the ubiquitous energy
currency of all living organisms. The high phosphate-
transfer potential of ATP is used for many biological processes,
including muscle contraction, synthesis and degradation of bio-
logical molecules, and membrane transport. In addition, it has
been suggested that ATP acts as an intracellular or extracellular
signaling molecule in cellular processes, such as insulin secretion
(1), neurotransmission (2), cell motility (3), and organ develop-
ment (4). However, it has been difficult to precisely understand
how ATP controls cellular processes and how the intracellular
ATP level is regulated at the single cell level, because the
conventional ATP quantification methods can only provide the
averaged ATP level of an ensemble of cells based on cell extract
analysis. Moreover, the distribution pattern of ATP between
different intracellular compartments is unclear. Several attempts
have been made to monitor ATP levels real-time in individual
cells; however, these methods present several problems. For
example, in chemiluminescence imaging from cells expressing
firefly luciferase (5), chemiluminescence by luciferase depends
not only on the intracellular ATP level but also on the luciferase
concentration, as well as the other substrates, oxygen, and
luciferin. Moreover, pH also affects luciferase activity. Another
drawback of this method is that the intracellular ATP level could
be perturbed because of ATP consumption. Furthermore, the
dim luminescence of luciferase requires longer exposure time for
image acquisition, making real-time observation cumbersome.
Other approaches include measurement of the ion channel
activity (6) or conformational change (7) of the ATP-sensitive
potassium channel (KATP channel). These methods are limited
to measurements of regions around the plasma membrane. In
addition, KATP channel expression may also affect the charac-
teristics of cells. Recently, a fluorescent indicator of the AT-
P:ADP ratio was developed (8). Although this probe is suitable
for monitoring the cellular energy level, it cannot be used to
directly measure the ATP level.
Here, we report on genetically-encoded fluorescence reso-
nance energy transfer (FRET)-based ATP indicators that em-
ploy the  subunit of the bacterial FoF1-ATP synthase. By using
these indicators, the ATP levels in different cellular compart-
ments and the dynamics of ATP in real-time can be monitored
at the single cell level. The bacterial  subunit is one of the
smallest ATP-binding proteins (14 kDa), which is composed of
one N-terminal -barrel domain and two C-terminal -helices
(Fig. 1). The physiological role of the  subunit is thought to be
the regulation of the FoF1-ATP synthase activity depending on
the intracellular ATP level (9–11). The  subunit confers several
advantages for a FRET-based ATP sensor. One is that the 
subunit binds to ATP, but does not hydrolyze it. Another
advantageous feature of the  subunit is the very high specificity
for ATP over the other nucleotides; ADP, GTP, CTP, and UTP
(12). Furthermore, the  subunit undergoes a large conforma-
tional change into a folded form upon ATP binding, by bundling
the two -helices, which are relaxed in the absence of ATP (13,
14) (Fig. 2A). This large conformational change upon ATP
binding may ensures a large dynamic range of the FRET signal.
Results
Development of a Series of ATP Indicators. We invented a FRET-
based ATP indicator by genetically linking mseCFP (15)—a
variant of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)—with monomeric
(A206K) Venus (mVenus) (16, 17)—a variant of yellow fluo-
rescent protein (YFP)—each at either the N- or C terminus of
the  subunit, which was derived from Bacillus subtilis FoF1-ATP
synthase. The generated indicator was termed ATeam (Aden-
osine 5-Triphosphate indicator based on Epsilon subunit for
Analytical Measurements). Four hydrophobic amino acid resi-
dues (Val-9, Leu-42, Phe-67, and Leu-78) forming a hydrophobic
surface to interact with the FoF1 complex were replaced by

hydrophilic residues, to retard incorporation into the FoF1 and
reduce nonspecific hydrophobic interaction with other proteins.
The dynamic range of FRET signal of the initial construct was
not considerably large (data not shown). It has been demon-
strated that by altering the relative orientations between donor
and acceptor fluorescent proteins of a cameleon calcium indi-
cator using a circularly permuted fluorescent protein, dynamic
range of FRET signal can be efficiently enhanced (18). To
improve the dynamic range of the ATeam, we substituted the
mVenus part of the ATeam with several circularly permuted
mVenus (18). A circularly permuted mVenus having the 173rd
amino acid as its N terminus (cp173-mVenus) yielded the largest
dynamic range; the construct is termed AT1.03 (Fig. 2A and Fig.
S1). The FRET signal increased by 2.3-fold (as assessed by the
emission ratio of 527/475 nm) upon the addition of ATP in vitro
(Fig. 2B). The dissociation constant (Kd) of AT1.03 was deter-
mined as 3.3 mM at 37 °C from plots of the emission ratio against
ATP concentration (here after [ATP]) (Fig. 2C). Thus, AT1.03
can be used for measuring intracellular ATP levels in the
millimolar range. To develop an indicator with higher affinity,
we constructed an ATeam employing the  subunit of Bacillus sp.
PS3, termed AT3.10 ( Fig. S1), on the basis of the findings of
previous studies, wherein the isolated  subunit derived from the
thermophilic Bacillus sp. PS3 was shown to exhibit 500-fold
higher affinity to ATP than that derived from mesophilic B.
subtilis (19, 20). As expected, the fluorescence emission ratio of
AT3.10 changed at significantly lower [ATP] than AT1.03, and
the apparent Kd of AT3.10 was determined to be 7.4 M at 37 °C
(Fig. 2C). It is unclear why the affinity between the two 
subunits differs markedly, despite the high similarity of amino
acid sequences (70% identity) and high conservation of the
amino acid residues that directly interact with ATP (Fig. S2A).
We found that the 60th residue in the N-terminal -sandwich
domain and the 132nd residue in the C-terminal -helical do-
main, which closely interact in the crystal structure of the
ATP-bound form of Bacillus sp. PS3  subunit, are not conserved
between the two  subunits (Fig. S2). Residues adjacent to the
132nd residue that do not have direct interaction with ATP are
also not conserved. Expecting that these residues might contrib-
ute to the affinity of the  subunit, these residues were exchanged
between AT1.03 and AT3.10 to construct AT1.03YEMK and
AT3.10MGK (Fig. S1). The apparent Kd values of AT1.03YEMK
and AT3.10MGK were 1.2 mM and 14 M at 37 °C (Fig. 2C),
which is approximately three-fold less and two-fold more than
that of the original constructs. These results indicate that the
affinity of the  subunit is partly determined by the stability of
the folded form, and that the affinity of the ATeam to ATP can
be adjusted to conduct individual experiments, by simply sub-
stituting the  subunit with that of a different bacteria and/or by
introducing point mutations into the interface between the N-
and C-terminal domains of the  subunit.
Characterization of ATeam Indicators In Vitro. We further examined
the characteristics of the purified ATeam indicators in vitro. In
contrast to the effect observed on ATP addition, addition of up
to 10 mM GTP or ADP had little effect on the YFP/CFP
emission ratio of AT1.03 (Fig. 3A), which was consistent with
previous findings (19). We also found that addition of even
dATP did not increase the emission ratio of AT1.03 (Fig. 3A);
rather, the emission ratio gradually decreased for unknown
reasons (10% decrease at 10 mM ADP). AT3.10 also exhibited
high selectivity for ATP: it showed 30-fold and 300-fold lower
affinity to ADP (Kd  0.23 mM) and GTP (Kd  2.6 mM),
respectively (Fig. S3), also consistent with previous studies (12,
13). The pH dependence of the FRET signal of AT1.03 was also
examined. The fluorescence emission ratio was almost invariant
from pH 7.1 to 8.5 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the fluorescence
signal from AT1.03 will not be affected by small pH fluctuations
around normal cytoplasmic pH, which is near 7.3 (21). The rates
of ATP binding (kon) and dissociation (koff) were determined to
be 1.7  102 mM1 s1 and 9.8  102 s1, respectively (Fig.
3C). Thus, AT1.03 can be used to monitor the dynamics of ATP
changes with rates up to 0.1 s1. Further, the temperature

FRET-based ATP probes, ATeam. (A) Schematic drawing of AT1.03
probe. Variants of CFP (mseCFP) and YFP (cp173-mVenus) were connected by
the  subunit of Bacillus subtilis FoF1-ATP synthase. In the ATP-free form (left),
extended and ﬂexible conformations of the  subunit separate the two
ﬂuorescent proteins, resulting in low FRET efﬁciency. In the ATP-bound form,
the  subunit retracts to draw the two ﬂuorescent proteins close to each other,
which increases FRET efﬁciency. (B) ATP-dependent ﬂuorescence spectral
change of AT1.03 in vitro. Fluorescence emission of AT1.03 proteins at various
ATP concentrations ([ATP]) and at 37 °C in 50 mM Mops-KOH (pH 7.3), 50 mM
KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100 was measured by exciting with 435
nm light. (C) ATP-dependent ﬂuorescence emission ratio (R) changes of four

The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) and Hill coefﬁcient (n) were calculated
to be 7.4 M and 1.7 (AT3.10), 14 M and 2.0 (AT3.10MGK), 1.2 mM and 2.1
(AT1.03YEMK), and 3.3 mM and 2.1 (AT1.03), respectively.

dependence of the affinity was investigated (Fig. 3D): the
dissociation constant of AT1.03 was elevated approximately
five-fold by an increase of 10 °C, close to the temperature-
sensitivity of the isolated Bacillus sp. PS3  subunit (13).
Comparison of ATP Levels in Different Subcellular Compartments.
Next, we visualized the ATP levels inside subcellular com-
partments of single living HeLa cells expressing AT1.03 for the
investigation of ATP distribution among cellular compart-
ments. When AT1.03 without a targeting sequence was ex-
pressed in HeLa cells, it was mainly distributed in the cyto-
plasm, and slightly in the nucleus (Fig. 4A). For the targeting
ATeam into the nucleus or mitochondrial matrix, a triplet of
the nuclear localization signal of SV40 large T-antigen or a
duplex of the mitochondrial targeting signal of cytochrome c
oxidase subunit VIII were each fused to the N terminus of
AT1.03 (nucAT1.03 and mitAT1.03; Fig. S1). These indicators
were properly localized to the desired cellular compartments
(Fig. 4 B and C). The YFP/CFP emission ratio was calculated
from CFP and YFP fluorescence images of the individual cells,
which were recorded using a wide-field fluorescence micro-
scope. We found that ATeam localized in the mitochondrial
matrix showed a significantly lower YFP/CFP emission ratio
than that in the cytoplasm or nucleus (Fig. 4). The nucleus also
showed a lower YFP/CFP emission ratio than the cytoplasm,
but to a smaller extent (Fig. 4D), suggesting that ATP can pass
through nuclear pores almost freely. The mitochondrial tar-
geting sequence will not affect the fluorescence ratio, because
as demonstrated for the cameleon calcium indicator, the
targeting sequence is cleaved after transport into mitochondria
(22). Higher mitochondrial pH does not account for the lower
YFP/CFP emission ratio, because the fluorescence of AT1.03
is almost invariant at pH conditions 7.3 (Fig. 3B). To confirm
that the low YFP/CFP emission ratio in mitochondria is not
due to some environmental effects but ATP level, HeLa cells
expressing derivatives of AT1.03 with different affinity to ATP
were also investigated. First, the same measurements were
carried out using AT1.03YEMK, which has a higher affinity as
described above. Although the YFP/CFP emission ratio of
mitochondria was lower than that of cytoplasm, their differ-
ence (16%) was much smaller than that (34%) observed with
AT1.03 (Fig. 4D). This means that the FRET signal of
cytoplasm is almost saturated. The nucleus showed the same
ratio as cytoplasm also due to the saturation of the FRET
signal. Then, we used another type of ATeam, which was
designed not to response to ATP. Structural studies revealed
that two arginine residues in the position of 122 and 126 of the
 subunit have a direct contact with the  and  phosphates of
ATP (Fig. S4A), suggesting their crucial roles on the ATP
recognition. A recent biochemical study showed that the
substitution of these residues with other ones leads drastic
decrement of the affinity to ATP (20). We constructed the

AT1.03R122K/R126K mutant by substituting the arginine residues
with lysine residues. This mutant ATeam did not respond even
to 10 mM ATP (Fig. S4B). Then, HeLa cells were observed
with AT1.03R122K/R126K. As expected, the cytoplasm, nucleus
and mitochondria showed essentially the same level of the
YFP/CFP emission ratio (Fig. 4D). Thus, it was confirmed that
the ATP level in mitochondria is lower than that of cytoplasm
or nucleus. However, the lower [ATP] level in mitochondria
may seem paradoxical when we consider that mitochondria are
the major ATP-producing organelles of cells. One possible
explanation is that adenine nucleotide translocator pumps
ATP from the mitochondria, thereby maintaining a high
ADP/ATP ratio; this seems preferable for FoF1-ATP synthase
to produce ATP from ADP and phosphate. One might point
out that the low dependence on oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) for ATP production of cancer cells like HeLa cells
(23) (also see below) causes the low [ATP] in mitochondria.
However, this possibility is unlikely, because we did not
observe clear changes of both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial
ATP level in HeLa cells grown in galactose medium (data not
shown), whose major ATP-generating pathway is OXPHOS
(see below). A lower [ATP] in mitochondria was also observed
in noncancer NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). For the gener-
ality and the mechanism of this phenomenon, further inves-
tigations remain to be done.
Real-Time Monitoring of Intracellular ATP Depletion. We next mon-
itored the dynamics of ATP levels in living HeLa cells after the
addition of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and potassium cyanide
(KCN), which are inhibitors of glycolysis and OXPHOS,
respectively. Fig. 5A shows sequential images of the CFP and
YFP channels. Addition of the inhibitors induced an increase
in CFP intensity and a decrease in YFP intensity, which rapidly
decreased the YFP/CFP emission ratio (i.e., decrease of
[ATP]; Fig. 5 A and C). Interestingly, the cytoplasmic [ATP]
partially recovered after the transient decay. This partial
[ATP] recovery would be the result of a cellular response to a
large decrease in intracellular [ATP]. Addition of 2DG alone
also induced a decrease of [ATP], although the drop rate was
much slower than when the two inhibitors were added. In
addition, recovery of [ATP] was hardly observed. In contrast
to 2DG, KCN itself had almost no effect on the intracellular
ATP level. The result is consistent with the fact that ATP
synthesis in actively proliferating cancer cells is mainly depen-
dent on glycolysis, rather than OXPHOS in mitochondria, even
in the aerobic environment (23). Our result showed that 2DG
and KCN have a synergistic rather than additive effect on the
intracellular ATP level, thereby suggesting that the intracel-
lular ATP level is synergistically regulated by both glycolysis
and OXPHOS. It has been shown that 80% of uptaken
glucose is metabolized through glycolysis, when HeLa cells are
grown in medium containing glucose (24). In contrast, when
galactose is used in medium instead of glucose, most of
galactose is metabolized through pentose phosphate pathway,
and contribution of glutamine to generation of ATP through
citrate cycle drastically increases (24). In addition, HeLa cells
grown in galactose show elevated mitochondrial respiration
rate and increased synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, as
compared to those grown in glucose (25). Therefore, it is
thought that ATP generation mainly depends on OXPHOS in
the cells grown in galacotose medium. To confirm this, we
compared changes of cytoplasmic [ATP] between cells grown
in glucose and galactose in response to inhibition of FoF1-ATP
synthase by oligomycin A. When oligomycin A was added to
the cells grown in glucose medium, apparent change in cyto-
plasmic ATP level was not observed (Fig. 6A). This is consis-
tent with the above result that OXPHOS inhibition by KCN did
not affect cytoplasmic [ATP] (Fig. 5D). On the other hand,
cytoplasmic [ATP] of HeLa cells grown in galactose was

rapidly depleted by the addition of oligomycin A. Cells did not
show partial recovery of [ATP] in this experiment, unlike those
grown in glucose medium and treated with 2DG and KCN (Fig.
5 C and D). These data clearly show that HeLa cells growing
in galactose medium generate most of cellular ATP using
OXPHOS, whereas those growing in glucose use glycolysis for
ATP production. This flexible alternation of energy metabo-
lism seems to be advantageous for the cells to propagate in
glucose-limiting conditions.
Discussion
In this study, we report a method to measure intracellular ATP
levels by using genetically-encoded FRET-based indicators for
ATP, ATeams. These probes show high selectivity to ATP over
other nucleotides. The affinity of ATeam to ATP is tunable by
substituting the  subunit with that from different species or
changing the amino acid residues at the domain interface. In
principle, it is possible to measure ATP levels at levels ranging
from 2 M to 8 mM by modulating the affinity of ATeam.
Organelle-specific ATP level monitoring was also shown to be
possible by targeting the probe to the nucleus and mitochondria.
This method showed that the mitochondrial ATP level is unex-
pectedly lower than that in the cytoplasm. ATeam is potentially
able to monitor any desired intracellular compartments by
attaching a proper signal sequence or by fusion to a localized
protein. ATeams can be used in broad fields of biological
research. For example, ATeam might become a strong tool to
study energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. In addi-
tion, estimation of intracellular ATP levels by ATeams might be
a good way to evaluate cell viability or toxicity of chemicals,
because dead cells lose intracellular ATP.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals. DNA polymerase and DNA ligation kits were purchased from
TaKaRa; oligonucleotides were from Hokkaido System Science; restriction
endonucleases were from Roche Diagnostics; ATP, ADP, GTP, and dATP were
from Sigma; and other chemical reagents were from Wako Pure Chemicals,
unless otherwise noted. ATP and other nucleotides were complexed with
equimolar magnesium chloride (MgCl2) before use in the experiments; there-
fore, the term ATP in this study means MgATP.
Gene Construction. B. subtilis  subunit cDNA with humanized codons was
synthesized by Hokkaido System Science. The synthesized cDNA also has V9T,
V42K, F67N, and Leu78T mutations to disrupt a hydrophobic patch for inter-
action with the  subunit of ATP synthase. The cDNA of mseCFPC11, the 
subunit, and cp173-mVenus was ampliﬁed by PCR (PCR) and then ligated.
Ligated DNA was then ligated to XhoI-HindIII sites of the pRSET-B vector
(Invitrogen) to obtain pRSET-AT1.03 for expression of AT1.03 in Escherichia
coli, and to XhoI–HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1() (Invitrogen) to obtain pcDNA-
AT1.03 for mammalian expression. pRSET-AT3.10, which is for expression of
AT3.10 in E. coli, was constructed by replacing the mseCFPC11 part of
pRSET-AT1.03 with mseCFPC10, and the B. subtilis  part with Bacillus sp. PS3
, which has V9T, V42K, F67N and L78N mutations. PCR-based mutagenesis
was used to construct pRSET-AT1.03YEMK and pRSET-AT3.10MGK from pRSET-
AT1.03 and pRSET-AT3.10, respectively.
Purification of ATeam. E. coli strain JM109(DE3) carrying ATeam plasmid was
cultured in LB medium at 37 °C for 3 h. Protein expression was then induced
by adding 10 M isopropyl--thiogalactopyranoside, followed by overnight
incubation at 24 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in
buffer A (100 mM sodium phosphate [pH 8.0], 200 mM sodium chloride, and
10 mM imidazole), and then disrupted by sonication. Cell-free extract, ob-
tained by centrifugation at 10,000  g for 60 min, was applied to a Ni-NTA
column (Qiagen) preequilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column
with buffer A, the protein was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentra-
tion to 200 mM. Fractions containing ATeam were concentrated, followed by
application to a Superdex200 gel-ﬁltration column (GE Healthcare) preequili-
brated with 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM sodium chloride. After
adding glycerol to a ﬁnal concentration of 20%, the puriﬁed ATeam protein
was stored at 20 °C for further use.
Characterization of ATeam In Vitro. Protein concentration was determined
using light absorption at 515 nm and the extinction coefﬁcient of Venus
protein (  92 mM1cm1)16. The ﬂuorescence of puriﬁed ATeam proteins
was investigated in buffer B (50 mM Mops-KOH [pH 7.3], 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM
MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100) using an FP-6500 spectroﬂuorometer (Jasco)
at 37 °C. To obtain the ﬂuorescence spectra, CFP was excited with 435 	 20 nm
light, and emission from 460 to 600 nm was scanned. To measure the time
course of CFP emission change, CFP was excited using 435 	 5 nm light and
emission at 475 	 10 nm was monitored by adding ATP at speciﬁc time points.
Cell Culture and Microscopy. HeLa cells were obtained from JCRB, and main-
tained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). For glucose-free culture, cells were maintained in
DMEM, which contains 10 mM galactose instead of glucose and is supple-
mented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen). Cells were plated on a collagen-
coated glass-bottom dish (FPI) and transfected with plasmid coding ATeam
cDNA by using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Between
one and four days after transfection, cells cultured in phenol red-free DMEM
were subjected to imaging. Wide-ﬁeld observations of the cells were per-
formed on a Nikon TE2000-PFS inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments) using
a PlanApo VC60, 1.40 numerical aperture (NA), oil-immersion objective (Ni-
kon). Filters used for dual-emission ratio imaging of ATeam were purchased
from Semrock: an FF01–427/10 excitation ﬁlter, an FF458-Di01 dichroic mirror,
and two emission ﬁlters (FF01–483/32 for CFP and FF01–542/27 for YFP). The
two emission ﬁlters were alternated by using a ﬁlter changer (Ludl Electronic
Products Ltd). Cells were illuminated using a 75-W xenon lamp through 12.5%
and 25% neutral density ﬁlters. Fluorescence emission from ATeam was
imaged by using a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (ORCA-AG;
Hamamatsu Photonics); the exposure times were 500 ms for CFP and YFP
images. Cells were maintained on a microscope at 37 °C with a continuous
supply of a 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide mixture by using a stage-top
incubator (Tokai Hit). Image analysis was performed using MetaMorph (Mo-
lecular Devices). The YFP/CFP emission ratio was calculated by dividing pixel-
by-pixel a YFP image with a CFP image.
