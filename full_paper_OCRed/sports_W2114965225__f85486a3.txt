Abstract
From early adolescence
through adulthood, women are
twice as likely as men to experi-
ence depression. Many differ-
ent explanations for this gender
difference in depression have
been offered, but none seems to
fully explain it. Recent research
has focused on gender differ-
ences in stress responses, and
in exposure to certain stressors.
I review this research and de-
scribe how gender differences
in stress experiences and stress
reactivity may interact to create
women’s greater vulnerability
to depression.
Keywords
gender; depression; stress
Across many nations, cultures,
and ethnicities, women are about
twice as likely as men to develop
depression (Nolen-Hoeksema,
1990; Weissman et al., 1996). This is
true whether depression is indexed
as a diagnosed mental disorder or
as subclinical symptoms. Diagnos-
able depressive disorders are ex-
traordinarily common in women,
who have a lifetime prevalence for
major depressive disorder of
21.3%, compared with 12.7% in
men (Kessler, McGonagle, Swartz,
Blazer, & Nelson, 1993).
Most explanations for the gen-
der difference in depression have
focused on individual variables,
and studies have attempted to
show that one variable is better
than another in explaining the dif-
ference. In three decades of re-
search, however, no one variable
has single-handedly accounted for
the gender difference in depres-
sion. In recent years, investigators
have moved toward more inte-
grated models, taking a transac-
tional, developmental approach.
Transactional models are appropri-
ate because it is clear that depres-
sion impairs social and occupa-
tional functioning, and thus can
have a major impact on an individ-
ual’s environment. Developmental
models are appropriate because
age groups differ markedly in the
gender difference in depression.
Girls are no more likely than boys
to evidence depression in child-
hood, but by about age 13, girls’
rates of depression begin to in-
crease sharply, whereas boys’ rates
of depression remain low, and may
even decrease. By late adolescence,
girls are twice as likely as boys to
be depressed, and this gender ratio
remains more or less the same
throughout adulthood. The abso-
lute rates of depression in women
and men vary substantially across
the life span, however.
In this review, I focus on two
themes in recent research. First, be-
cause women have less power and
status than men in most societies,
they experience certain traumas, par-
ticularly sexual abuse, more often
than men. They also experience
more chronic strains, such as pov-
erty, harassment, lack of respect, and
constrained choices. Second, even
when women and men experience
the same stressors, women may be
more likely than men to develop de-
pression because of gender differ-
ences in biological responses to stres-
sors, self-concepts, or coping styles.
Frequent stressful experiences
and reactivity to stress are likely to
have reciprocal effects on each
other. Stressful experiences can
sensitize both biological and psy-
chological systems to future stress,
making it more likely that individ-
uals will react with depression. In
turn, reactivity to stress is associ-
ated with impaired problem solv-
ing, and, as a result, with the accu-
mulation or generation of new
stressors, which may contribute to
more depression.
 
STRESSFUL LIFE EVENTS
 
Women’s lack of social power
makes them more vulnerable than
men to specific major traumas, par-
ticularly sexual abuse. Traumas
may contribute directly to depres-
sion, by making women feel they
are helpless to control their lives,
and may also contribute indirectly,
by increasing women’s reactivity
to stress. Women’s social roles also
carry a number of chronic strains
that might contribute directly or in-
directly to depression. Major
changes in the frequency of trau-
matic events and in social roles co-
incide with the emergence of gen-
der differences in depression in
adolescence, and may help to ex-
plain this emergence.
 
Victimization
 
Women are the victims of sexual
assault—defined as being pres-
sured or forced into unwanted sex-
ual contact—at least twice as often
as men, and people with a history
of sexual assault have increased
rates of depression (see Weiss,
Longhurst, & Mazure, 1999). Sex-
ual assault during childhood has
been more consistently linked with
the gender difference in depression
than sexual assault that first occurs
during adulthood. Estimates of the
prevalence of childhood sexual as-
sault range widely. Cutler and I re-
viewed the most methodologically

sound studies including both male
and female participants and found
rates of childhood sexual assault
between 7 and 19% for females and
between 3 and 7% for males (Cutler
& Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). We esti-
mated that, in turn, as much as 35%
of the gender difference in adult
depression could be accounted for
by the higher incidence of assault
of girls relative to boys. A few
studies have examined whether
depression might be an antecedent
rather than a consequence of sex-
ual assault. Depression does ap-
pear to increase risk for sexual as-
sault in women and men, but
sexual assault significantly in-
creases risk for first or new onsets
of depression.
Childhood sexual assault may
increase risk for depression
throughout the life span because
abuse experiences negatively alter
biological and psychological re-
sponses to stress (Weiss et al.,
1999). Children and adolescents
who have been abused, particu-
larly those who have been repeat-
edly abused over an extended pe-
riod of time, tend to have poorly
regulated biological response to
stress. Abuse experiences can also
negatively alter children’s and ado-
lescents’ perspectives on them-
selves and others, contributing to
their vulnerability to depression
(Zahn-Waxler, 2000).
 
Chronic Strains
 
Women face a number of
chronic burdens in everyday life as
a result of their social status and
roles relative to men, and these
strains could contribute to their
higher rates of depression (see
Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990). Women
make less money than men, and
are much more likely than men to
live in poverty. Women are more
likely than men to be sexually ha-
rassed on the job. Women often
have full-time paid jobs and also
do nearly all the child care and do-
mestic work of the home. In addi-
tion, women are increasingly
“sandwiched” between caring for
young children and caring for sick
and elderly family members. This
role overload is said to contribute
to a sense of “burn out” and gen-
eral distress, including depressive
symptoms, in women.
In the context of heterosexual re-
lationships, some women face in-
equities in the distribution of
power over important decisions
that must be made, such as the de-
cision to move to a new city, or the
decision to buy an expensive item
such as a car (Nolen-Hoeksema,
Larson, & Grayson, 1999). Even
when they voice their opinions,
women may feel these opinions are
not taken seriously, or that their
viewpoints on important issues are
not respected and affirmed by their
partners. My colleagues and I mea-
sured chronic strain by grouping
inequities in workload and hetero-
sexual relationships into a single
variable, and found that this vari-
able predicted increases in depres-
sion over time, and partially ac-
counted for the gender difference
in depression (Nolen-Hoeksema et
al., 1999). Depression also contrib-
uted to increased chronic strain
over time, probably because it was
associated with reductions in per-
ceptions of control and effective
problem solving.
Gender Intensification
in Adolescence
Social pressure to conform to
gender roles is thought to increase
dramatically as children move
through puberty. For girls, this
may mean a reduction in their op-
portunities and choices, either real
or perceived. According to adoles-
cents’ own reports, parents restrict
girls’ more than boys’ behaviors
and have lower expectations for
girls’ than for boys’ competencies
and achievements. Girls also feel
that if they pursue male-stereo-
typed activities and preferences,
such as interests in math and sci-
ence or in competitive sports, they
are rejected by their peers. For
many girls, especially white girls,
popularity and social acceptance
become narrowly oriented around
appearance.
This narrowing of acceptable be-
havior for girls in early adoles-
cence may contribute to the in-
crease in depression in girls at this
time, although this popular theory
has been the focus of remarkably
little empirical research (Nolen-
Hoeksema & Girgus, 1994). There
is substantial evidence that exces-
sive concern about appearance is
negatively associated with well-
being in girls, but these findings
may apply primarily to white girls.
In addition, very little research has
examined whether appearance
concerns and gender roles are risk
factors for depression or only cor-
relates.
REACTIVITY TO STRESS
Even when women and men are
confronted with similar stressors,
women may be more vulnerable
than men to developing depression
and related anxiety disorders such
as posttraumatic stress disorder
(Breslau, Davis, Andreski, Peter-
son, & Schultz, 1997). Women’s
greater reactivity compared with
men’s has been attributed to gender
differences in biological responses,
self-concepts, and coping styles.
Biological Responses to Stress
For many years, the biological
explanations for women’s greater
vulnerability to depression focused
on the direct effects of the ovarian
hormones (especially estrogen and
progesterone) on women’s moods.
This literature is too large and com-

plicated to review here (but see
Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990, 1995). Sim-
ply put, despite widespread popu-
lar belief that women are more
prone to depression than men be-
cause of direct negative effects of es-
trogen or progesterone on mood,
there is little consistent scientific ev-
idence to support this belief. Al-
though some women do become
depressed during periods of hor-
monal change, including puberty,
the premenstrual period of the men-
strual cycle, menopause, and the
postpartum period, it is unclear that
these depressions are due to the di-
rect effects of hormonal changes on
mood, or that depressions during
these periods of women’s lives ac-
count for the gender differences in
rates of depression.
More recent biological research
has focused not on direct effects of
ovarian hormones on moods, but
on the moderating effects of hor-
mones, particularly adrenal hor-
mones, on responses to stress. The
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis plays a major role in reg-
ulating stress responses, in part by
regulating levels of a number of
hormones, including cortisol, which
is released by the adrenal glands in
response to chemicals secreted by
the brain’s hypothalamus and then
the pituitary. In turn, cortisol levels
can affect other biochemicals
known to influence moods. People
with major depressive disorder of-
ten show elevated cortisol re-
sponses to stress, indicating dysreg-
ulation of the HPA response.
An intriguing hypothesis is that
women are more likely than men
to have a dysregulated HPA re-
sponse to stress, which makes
them more likely to develop de-
pression in response to stress
(Weiss et al., 1999). Women may be
more likely to have a dysregulated
HPA response because they are
more likely to have suffered trau-
matic events, which are known to
contribute to HPA dysregulation.
In addition, ovarian hormones
modulate regulation of the HPA
axis (Young & Korszun, 1999).
Some women may have depres-
sions during periods of rapid
change in levels of ovarian hor-
mones (the postpartum period,
premenstrual period, menopause,
and puberty) because hormonal
changes trigger dysregulation of
the stress response, making these
women more vulnerable to depres-
sion, particularly when they are
confronted with stress. The causal
relationship between HPA axis
regulation and the gender differ-
ence in depression has not been es-
tablished but is likely to be a major
focus of future research.
 
Self-Concept
 
Although the idea that girls have
more negative self-concepts than
boys is a mainstay of the pop-psy-
chology literature, empirical studies
testing this hypothesis have pro-
duced mixed results (Nolen-Hoek-
sema & Girgus, 1994). Several stud-
ies have found no gender differences
in self-esteem, self-concept, or dys-
functional attitudes. Those studies
that do find gender differences,
however, tend to show that girls
have poorer self-concepts than
boys. Again, negative self-concepts
could contribute directly to depres-
sion, and could interact with stres-
sors to contribute to depression.
Negative self-concept has been
shown to predict increases in de-
pression in some studies of children
(Nolen-Hoeksema & Girgus, 1994).
One consistent difference in
males’ and females’ self-concepts
concerns interpersonal orientation,
the tendency to be concerned with
the status of one’s relationships and
the opinions others hold of oneself.
Even in childhood, girls appear
more interpersonally oriented than
boys, and this gender difference in-
creases in adolescence (Zahn-Wax-
ler, 2000). When interpersonal ori-
entation leads girls and women to
subordinate their own needs and
desires completely to those of oth-
ers, they become excessively de-
pendent on the good graces of oth-
ers (Cyranowski, Frank, Young, &
Shear, 2000). They may then be at
high risk for depression when con-
flicts arise in relationships, or rela-
tionships end. Several recent stud-
ies have shown that girls and
women are more likely than boys
and men to develop depression in
response to interpersonal stressors.
Because depression can also inter-
fere with interpersonal functioning,
an important topic for future re-
search is whether the gender differ-
ence in depression is a consequence
or cause of gender differences in in-
terpersonal strain.
 
Coping Styles
 
By adolescence, girls appear to
be more likely than boys to respond
to stress and distress with rumina-
tion—focusing inward on feelings
of distress and personal concerns
rather than taking action to relieve
their distress. This gender differ-
ence in rumination then is main-
tained throughout adulthood. Sev-
eral longitudinal and experimental
studies have shown that people
who ruminate in response to stress
are at increased risk to develop de-
pressive symptoms and depressive
disorders over time (Nolen-Hoek-
sema et al., 1999). In turn, the gen-
der difference in rumination at least
partially accounts for the gender
difference in depression. Rumina-
tion may not only contribute di-
rectly to depression, but may also
contribute indirectly by impairing
problem solving, and thus prevent-
ing women from taking action to
overcome the stressors they face.
 
AN INTEGRATIVE MODEL
 
Women suffer certain stressors
more often than men and may be

more vulnerable to develop de-
pression in response to stress be-
cause of a number of factors. Both
stress experiences and stress reac-
tivity contribute directly to
women’s greater rates of depres-
sion compared with men. Stress ex-
periences and stress reactivity also
feed on each other, however. The
more stress women suffer, the
more hyperresponsive they may be
to stress, both biologically and psy-
chologically. This hyperrespon-
siveness may undermine women’s
ability to control their environ-
ments and overcome their stress,
leading to even more stress in the
future. In addition, depression con-
tributes directly to more stressful
experiences, by interfering with oc-
cupational and social functioning,
and to vulnerability to stress, by in-
citing rumination, robbing the in-
dividual of any sense of mastery
she did have, and possibly sensitiz-
ing the biological systems involved
in the stress response.
Important advances will be
made in explaining the gender dif-
ference in depression as we under-
stand better the reciprocal effects of
biological, social, and psychological
systems on each other. Key devel-
opmental transitions, particularly
the early adolescent years, are natu-
ral laboratories for observing the
establishment of these processes,
because so much changes during
these transitions, and these transi-
tions are times of increased risk.
Additional questions for future
research include how culture and
ethnicity affect the gender differ-
ence in depression. The gender dif-
ference is found across most cul-
tures and ethnicities, but its size
varies considerably, as do the abso-
lute percentages of depressed
women and men. The processes
contributing to the gender differ-
ence in depression may also vary
across cultures and ethnicities.
Understanding the gender dif-
ference in depression is important
for at least two reasons. First,
women’s high rates of depression
exact tremendous costs in quality
of life and productivity, for women
themselves and their families. Sec-
ond, understanding the gender dif-
ference in depression will help us
to understand the causes of depres-
sion in general. In this way, gender
provides a valuable lens through
which to examine basic human
processes in psychopathology.
