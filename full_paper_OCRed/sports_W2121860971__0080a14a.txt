Background
Virtual reality and interactive video gaming have emerged as recent treatment approaches in stroke rehabilitation. In particular,
commercial gaming consoles have been rapidly adopted in clinical settings. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2011.
Objectives
Primary objective: To determine the efﬁcacy of virtual reality compared with an alternative intervention or no intervention on upper
limb function and activity.
Secondary objective: To determine the efﬁcacy of virtual reality compared with an alternative intervention or no intervention on: gait
and balance activity, global motor function, cognitive function, activity limitation, participation restriction and quality of life, voxels
or regions of interest identiﬁed via imaging, and adverse events. Additionally, we aimed to comment on the feasibility of virtual reality
for use with stroke patients by reporting on patient eligibility criteria and recruitment.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The
Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2013), EMBASE (1980 to November 2013) and seven additional
databases. We also searched trials registries and reference lists.
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of virtual reality (“an advanced form of human-computer interface that allows the user to
’interact’ with and become ’immersed’ in a computer-generated environment in a naturalistic fashion”) in adults after stroke. The
primary outcome of interest was upper limb function and activity. Secondary outcomes included gait and balance function and activity,
and global motor function.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials based on pre-deﬁned inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third
review author moderated disagreements when required. The authors contacted investigators to obtain missing information.

Main results
We included 37 trials that involved 1019 participants. Study sample sizes were generally small and interventions varied. The risk of
bias present in many studies was unclear due to poor reporting. Thus, while there are a large number of randomised controlled trials,
the evidence remains ’low’ or ’very low’ quality when rated using the GRADE system. Control groups received no intervention or
therapy based on a standard care approach. Intervention approaches in the included studies were predominantly designed to improve
motor function rather than cognitive function or activity performance. The majority of participants were relatively young and more
than one year post stroke. Primary outcome: results were statistically signiﬁcant for upper limb function (standardised mean difference
(SMD) 0.28, 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) 0.08 to 0.49 based on 12 studies with 397 participants). Secondary outcomes: there were
no statistically signiﬁcant effects for grip strength, gait speed or global motor function. Results were statistically signiﬁcant for the
activities of daily living (ADL) outcome (SMD 0.43, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.69 based on eight studies with 253 participants); however, we
were unable to pool results for cognitive function, participation restriction, quality of life or imaging studies. There were few adverse
events reported across studies and those reported were relatively mild. Studies that reported on eligibility rates showed that only 26%
of participants screened were recruited.
Authors’ conclusions
We found evidence that the use of virtual reality and interactive video gaming may be beneﬁcial in improving upper limb function
and ADL function when used as an adjunct to usual care (to increase overall therapy time) or when compared with the same dose
of conventional therapy. There was insufﬁcient evidence to reach conclusions about the effect of virtual reality and interactive video
gaming on grip strength, gait speed or global motor function. It is unclear at present which characteristics of virtual reality are most
important and it is unknown whether effects are sustained in the longer term.

Virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation
Review question: We wanted to compare the effects of virtual reality on arm function (and other outcomes such as walking speed and
independence in managing daily activities) after stroke versus an alternative intervention or no intervention.
Background: Many people after having a stroke have difﬁculty moving, thinking and sensing. This often results in problems with
everyday activities such as writing, walking and driving. Virtual reality and interactive video gaming are new types of therapy being
provided to people after having a stroke. The therapy involves using computer-based programs that are designed to simulate real life
objects and events. Virtual reality and interactive video gaming may have some advantages over traditional therapy approaches as they
can give people an opportunity to practise everyday activities that are not or cannot be practised within the hospital environment.
Furthermore, there are several features of virtual reality that might mean that patients spend more time in therapy: for example, the
activity might be more motivating.
Study characteristics: We identiﬁed 37 studies involving 1019 people after stroke. A wide range of virtual reality programs were used
and most of the programs required the person using the program to be relatively active (as opposed to smaller movements associated
with simply moving a joystick). The evidence is current to November 2013.
Key results: Twelve trials tested whether the use of virtual reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in improved ability
to use one’s arm and found that the use of virtual reality resulted in better arm function. Four trials tested whether the use of virtual
reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in improved walking speed. There was no evidence that virtual reality was more
effective in this case. Eight trials found that there was some evidence that virtual reality resulted in a slightly better ability to manage
everyday activities such as showering and dressing. However, these positive effects were found soon after the end of the treatment and
it is not clear whether the effects are long lasting. Results should be interpreted with caution as the studies involved small numbers of
participants. Very few people using virtual reality reported pain, headaches or dizziness and no serious adverse events were reported.
Quality of the evidence: We classiﬁed the quality of the evidence as low for arm function. The quality of the evidence was very low for
walking ability, global motor function and independence in performing daily activities. The quality of the evidence for each outcome
was limited due to small numbers of study participants, inconsistent results across studies and poor reporting of study details.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1Risk of bias was unclear in a number of studies.
2Downgraded by 1 due to inconsistency in findings across studies.
3Surrogate outcome.
4Small total population size (< 400).
5Serious risk of bias in most studies.
6The intervention group in this comparison received additional therapy therefore the dose was not equal between groups.

Description of the condition
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability and
has been described as a worldwide epidemic (Feigin 2014; Go
2014). The effects of a stroke may include sensory, motor and
cognitive impairment as well as a reduced ability to perform self
care and participate in social and community activities (Miller
2010). While most recovery is thought to be made in the ﬁrst few
weeks after stroke, patients may make improvements on functional
tasks many months after having a stroke (Teasell 2014). Many
stroke survivors report long-term disability and reduced quality of
life (Patel 2006; Sturm 2004)
Description of the intervention
Repetitive task training has been shown to be effective in some
aspects of rehabilitation, such as improving walking distance and
speed and improving upper limb function (French 2007; Veerbeek
2014). Virtual reality is a relatively recent approach that may en-
able simulated practice of functional tasks at a higher dosage than
traditional therapies (Demain 2013; Fung 2012; Kwakkel 2004;
Merians 2002; National Stroke Foundation 2012). Virtual reality
has been deﬁned as the “use of interactive simulations created with
computer hardware and software to present users with opportuni-
ties to engage in environments that appear and feel similar to real-
world objects and events” (Weiss 2006).
Virtual reality has previously been used in a variety of voca-
tional training settings, such as ﬂight simulation training for pi-
lots (Lintern 1990) and procedural training for surgeons (Larsen
2009). Within health care, the intervention has been used to treat
phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder and body image disorders
(Schultheis 2001). Although its research in rehabilitation is be-
coming more prevalent as technology becomes more accessible
and affordable, the use of virtual reality is not yet commonplace
in clinical rehabilitation settings (Burridge 2010). However, gam-
ing consoles are ubiquitous and so researchers and clinicians are
turning to low-cost commercial gaming systems as an alternative
way of delivering virtual reality (Deutsch 2008; Lange 2012; Rand
2008). These systems, which were originally designed for recre-
ation, are being adapted by clinicians for therapeutic purposes. In
addition, interactive video games are speciﬁcally being designed
for rehabilitation (Lange 2010; Lange 2012).
In virtual rehabilitation, virtual environments and objects provide
the user with visual feedback, which may be presented though a
head-mounted device, projection system or ﬂat screen. Feedback
may also be provided through the senses, for example, hearing,
touch, movement, balance and smell (Weiss 2006). The user inter-
acts with the environment by a variety of mechanisms. These may
be simple devices, such as a mouse or joystick, or more complex
systems using cameras, sensors or haptic (touch) feedback devices
(Weiss 2006). Thus, depending on the intervention, the user’s level
of physical activity may range from relatively inactive (for exam-
ple, sitting at a computer using a joystick), to highly active (for
example, challenging full-body movements). Virtual reality relies
on computer hardware and software that mediates the interaction
between the user and the virtual environment (Greenleaf 1994).
Key concepts related to virtual reality are immersion and presence.
Immersion refers to the extent to which the user perceives that
they are in the virtual environment rather than the real world and
is related to the design of the software and hardware (Weiss 2006).
Virtual environments can range in their degree of immersion of
the user. Systems that include projection onto a concave surface,
head-mounted display or video capture in which the user is rep-
resented within the virtual environment are generally described as
immersive, whereas a single screen projection or desktop display
are considered low immersion.
Presence is the subjective experience of the user and is depen-
dent on the characteristics of the virtual reality system, the vir-
tual task and the characteristics of the user. People are considered
present when they report the feeling of being in the virtual world
(Schuemie 2001).
How the intervention might work
Virtual reality may be advantageous as it offers several features,
such as goal-oriented tasks and repetition, shown to be important
in neurological rehabilitation (Langhorne 2011; Veerbeek 2014).
Animal research has shown that training in enriched environments
results in better problem solving and performance of functional
tasks than training in basic environments (Risedal 2002). Virtual
reality may have the potential to provide an enriched environment
in which people with stroke can problem solve and master new
skills. Virtual tasks have been described as more interesting and
enjoyable by both children and adults, thereby encouraging higher
numbers of repetitions (Lewis 2012).
Evidence of neuroplasticity as a result of training in virtual reality
is modest; however, neuroimaging ﬁndings are guiding the devel-
opment of virtual reality. Two investigators have shown that func-
tional improvements after virtual reality training were paralleled
with a lateralisation of neural activation from the contralesional
sensorimotor activation prior to training, to an ipsilesional repre-
sentation after training (Jang 2005; You 2005). A perspective on
virtual reality compared with regular exercise was provided by Kim
and colleagues (Kim 2014). They reported that for people post
stroke virtual reality wrist exercises with transcranial direct cur-
rent stimulation facilitated a greater post-exercise cortico-spinal
excitability than virtual reality or active exercises alone. Tunik and
colleagues have shown that when individuals post stroke were pre-
sented with discordant feedback, they activated the primary mo-
tor region (M1) to a greater extent than when feedback was not
discordant (Tunik 2013). Notably, when discordant feedback cor-

responded to the affected and moving hand, the contralateral M1
region was recruited (Bagce 2012; Tunik 2013). Conversely, by
having participants move the unaffected hand with virtual mirror
feedback, the ipsilateral (affected) M1 region was recruited (de-
spite the affected hand remaining static) (Saleh 2014). Their ﬁnd-
ings suggest that tailoring manipulation of the visual feedback in
virtual reality to the needs of the patient may serve as a tool for
rehabilitation.
Grading of tasks and immediate feedback have been shown to op-
timise motor learning (Sveistrup 2004). Virtual reality offers clin-
icians the ability to control and grade tasks to challenge the user,
and programs often incorporate multimodal feedback provided in
real time. Furthermore, clinicians are able to trial tasks that are
unsafe to practise in the real world, such as crossing the street.
Many programs are designed to be used without supervision, also
meaning that increased dosage of therapy can be provided without
increased stafﬁng levels.
Why it is important to do this review
As technology becomes more accessible and affordable, virtual re-
ality is likely to become even more widely used in clinical reha-
bilitation settings (Bohil 2011; Burridge 2010). It is important to
evaluate the efﬁcacy of virtual reality in order to guide future de-
sign and use. Furthermore, therapeutic interventions that increase
the dose of task-speciﬁc training without increasing stafﬁng will
be sought after as economic pressure and an ageing population
impact on health care.
There are now a number of systematic reviews examining the ef-
ﬁcacy of virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation (Crosbie 2007;
Lohse 2014; Moreira 2013; Saposnik 2011) and more speciﬁcally
commercial gaming devices for upper limb stroke rehabilitation
(Thomson 2014). Our initial review published in 2011 identiﬁed
19 studies and a number of ongoing studies. The area is rapidly
expanding and therefore an update of our review was warranted.

Primary objective
To determine the efﬁcacy of virtual reality compared with an al-
ternative intervention or no intervention on:
1. upper limb function and activity;
Secondary objective
To determine the efﬁcacy of virtual reality compared with an al-
ternative intervention or no intervention on:
1. gait and balance activity;
2. global motor function;
3. cognitive function;
4. activity limitation;
5. participation restriction and quality of life;
6. voxels or regions of interest identiﬁed via imaging; and
7. adverse events.
Additionally, we aimed to comment on the feasibility of virtual re-
ality for use with stroke patients by reporting on patient eligibility
criteria and recruitment.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and
quasi-randomised (e.g. allocation by birth date) controlled trials
(QRCTs). We included one QRCT and the remaining studies
were RCTs. Where the QRCT was included in a meta-analysis
we carried out a sensitivity analysis restricting analysis to truly
randomised studies. We looked for studies that compared virtual
reality with either an alternative intervention or no intervention.
We did not include studies that compared two different types of
virtual reality without an alternative group. We included trials
that evaluated any intensity and duration of virtual reality that
exceeded a single treatment session.
Types of participants
The study participants had a diagnosis of stroke, deﬁned by the
World Health Organization as “a syndrome of rapidly developing
symptoms and signs of focal, and at times global, loss of cerebral
function lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death with no
apparent cause other than that of vascular origin” (WHO 1989),
diagnosed by imaging or neurological examination. We included
patients who were 18 years and older with all types of stroke,
all levels of severity, and at all stages post stroke, including those
patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. We excluded studies of
participants with mixed aetiology (for example, participants with
acquired brain injury) unless data were available relating to the
people with stroke only.
Types of interventions
We included studies using virtual reality interventions that met
the following deﬁnition: “an advanced form of human-computer
6

interface that allows the user to ’interact’ with and become ’im-
mersed’ in a computer-generated environment in a naturalistic
fashion” (Schultheis 2001).
We included studies using any form of non-immersive or immer-
sive virtual reality, and studies that used commercially available
gaming consoles.
The comparison group received either an alternative intervention
or no intervention. Given the broad range of alternative interven-
tions, we considered these to include any activity designed to be
therapeutic at the impairment, activity or participation level that
did not include the use of virtual reality.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
As one of the most common applications of virtual reality in stroke
rehabilitationisupperlimbrehabilitationwe selectedthe following
primary outcome:
1. Upper limb function and activity:
i) arm function and activity: including assessments such
as the Motor Assessment Scale (upper limb), Action Research
Arm Test, Wolf Motor Function Test;
ii) hand function and activity: including assessments such
as the Nine Hole Peg Test, Box and Block Test.
Secondary outcomes
1. Gait and balance activity:
i) lower limb activity: including assessments such as
walking distance, walking speed, Community Walk Test,
functional ambulation, Timed Up and Go Test;
ii) balance and postural control: including assessments
such as the Berg Balance Scale and laboratory-based force plate
measures.
2. Global motor function: including assessments such as the
Motor Assessment Scale.
3. Cognitive function: including assessments such as Trail
Making Test, Useful Field of View Test.
4. Activity limitation: including assessments such as the
Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Barthel Index,
Activities-speciﬁc Balance Conﬁdence Scale, on-road driving test.
5. Participation restriction and quality of life: including
assessments such as the SF36, EQ5D, Stroke Impact Scale or
other patient-reported outcomes.
6. Voxels or regions of interest identiﬁed via imaging.
7. Adverse events: including motion sickness, pain, injury, falls
and death.
We included the primary outcome (upper limb function) and gait,
global motor function and quality of life in Summary of ﬁndings
for the main comparison.
Search methods for identiﬁcation of studies
See the ’Specialised register’ section in the Cochrane Stroke Group
module. We searched for relevant trials in all languages and ar-
ranged translation of trial reports published in languages other
than English.
Electronic searches
The search for studies in our previous review was conducted in
March 2010; the search for this update was completed in Novem-
ber 2013. We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Regis-
ter, which was searched by the Managing Editor in October 2013
using the intervention codes ’computer-aided therapy’ and ’virtual
reality therapy’. We identiﬁed 48 studies in total.
In addition, we searched the following electronic bibliographic
databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL 2013, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1950 to October Week
3, 2013) (Appendix 1), EMBASE (1980 to Week 44, 2013)
(Appendix 2), AMED (1985 to October 2013) (Appendix 3),
CINAHL (1982 to November Week 3, 2013) (Appendix 4),
PsycINFO (1840 to November Week 3, 2013) (Appendix 5), Psy-
cBITE (Psychological Database for Brain Impairment Treatment
Efﬁcacy, http://www.psycbite.com/) (to 26 October 2013) and
OTseeker (http://www.otseeker.com/) (to 26 October 2013). We
also searched the engineering databases COMPENDEX (1970 to
29 November 2013) and INSPEC (1969 to 29 November 2013)
for studies from a non-medical background.
Our search strategies were developed by the Cochrane Stroke
Group Trials Search Co-ordinator for MEDLINE (Ovid) and we
adapted them for other databases with the assistance of an experi-
enced medical librarian.
Searching other resources
In order to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing
trials, we:
1. searched the following ongoing trials registers: Current
Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com), National
Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database (http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov) and Stroke Trials Registry (
www.strokecenter.org/trials/) to 30 January 2014;
2. used the Cited Reference Search within Science Citation
Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) to track
relevant references for all included studies;
3. scanned the reference lists of all included studies;
4. searched Dissertation Abstracts (15 June 2014);
5. scanned the abstracts of non-English language studies if
they were available in English;
6. searched the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers) electronic library (to 27 October 2013).
For the previous version of this review we carried out the following
searches.

1. We handsearched the proceedings of the International
Workshop on Virtual Rehabilitation (2003 to 2005), Virtual
Rehabilitation Conference (2007 to 2009), International
Conference Series on Disability, Virtual Reality and Associated
Technologies (2000 to 2008) and Cybertherapy (2003 to 2007).
2. We contacted 12 manufacturers of virtual reality equipment
to ask for details of trials. We contacted the following
manufacturers by telephone, email or postal mail: Nintendo,
Sony, GestureTek, NeuroVR, Hocoma, Motek, Virtual Realities,
Haptic Master, Microsoft Xbox, Essential Reality, SensAble,
Novint and Cyberglove. Three of the manufacturers responded
(Nintendo, Motek and Novint); however, they were unable to
provide details of studies eligible for inclusion in the review.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
One review author (KL) performed the searches. Two of the au-
thors (KL and ST) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts
identiﬁed from the database searches to assess whether they met
the pre-deﬁned inclusion criteria. The review authors obtained
potentially relevant articles in full text and KL contacted authors
when more information was required. KL and ST then indepen-
dently reviewed full-text articles and correspondence with investi-
gators to determine studies to be included in the review. JD made
the ﬁnal decision on studies that KL and ST disagreed on. We doc-
umented the reasons for the exclusion of studies. Where studies
published in non-English languages appeared relevant, we sought
the full text of the study. In these cases, the Trials Search Co-ordi-
nator arranged for someone ﬂuent in the non-English language to
review the paper to ascertain whether the study met the inclusion
criteria.
Data extraction and management
Two review authors (KL and ST, SG or JD) independently ex-
tracted data using a pre-designed data extraction form for each
selected study. Data extracted included citation details, trial set-
ting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study population, partici-
pant ﬂow, intervention details, outcome measures and results, and
methodological quality. We resolved disagreements by discussion
or by referral to a third review author (MC) as necessary. The re-
view authors contacted authors by email to gain any missing in-
formation necessary for the review.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (KL and ST, SG or JD) used The Cochrane
Collaboration’s ’Risk of bias’ tool to independently assess the
methodological quality of the included studies (Appendix 6). The
tool covers the domains of sequence generation, allocation con-
cealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data
and selective reporting. We classiﬁed items as ’low risk’, ’high risk’
or ’unclear risk’ of bias. We omitted the domain that assesses the
blinding of participants as we were of the opinion that this domain
related to the nature of the intervention and not study quality. We
contacted the authors of the included studies for more informa-
tion where insufﬁcient information was published to assess the risk
of bias. We resolved disagreements with help from a third review
author (MC).
We employed GRADE to interpret ﬁndings and used GRADE-
pro to create a ’Summary of ﬁndings’ table (Guyatt 2008). The
table provides outcome-speciﬁc information concerning the over-
all quality of evidence from studies included in the comparison,
the magnitude of effect of the intervention and the sum of avail-
able data on the outcomes considered. When using GRADE, we
downgraded the evidence from ’high quality’ by one level for se-
rious (or by two for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias),
indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of ef-
fect estimates or potential publication bias.
Measures of treatment effect
Two review authors (KL and ST, SG or JD) independently clas-
siﬁed outcome measures in terms of the domain assessed (upper
limb function, hand function, lower limb and gait activity, bal-
ance and postural control, global motor function, cognitive func-
tion, activity limitation, participation restriction and quality of
life, neuroimagingstudies). Whenastudypresentedmore thanone
outcome measure for the same domain, we included the measure
most frequently used across studies in the analysis. We planned to
calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for
any dichotomous outcomes, if recorded. We calculated mean dif-
ferences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) for con-
tinuous outcomes as appropriate.
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of randomisation in these trials was the individual pa-
tient. We did not include any cluster-randomised controlled trials.
Five of the studies were three-armed trials. Lam 2006 compared
virtual reality with an alternative intervention and no intervention.
We used the data comparing the virtual reality arm with the alter-
native intervention arm to avoid double counting. Coupar 2012
compared a usual care group with a group that received additional
’low intensity’ virtual reality intervention and a group that received
additional ’high intensity’ virtual reality intervention. We com-
pared the high intensity virtual reality group with the usual care
group. da Silva Cameirao 2011 compared a virtual reality inter-
vention using a specialised program with virtual reality using the
Nintendo Wii and conventional therapy. We used the data from
the specialised virtual reality group and the conventional therapy
group. Byl 2013 compared conventional therapy with unilateral
8

and bilateral virtual reality intervention. We used the data from
the bilateral virtual reality intervention as it was thought to be
closest to the type of therapy included in the conventional therapy
sessions. Finally, Zucconi 2012 compared a virtual reality inter-
vention with feedback on performance with a virtual reality inter-
vention without feedback and conventional therapy. We included
the data from the virtual reality with feedback group and com-
pared it with the conventional therapy group.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted study authors to obtain any missing data and con-
verted available data when possible (for example, we converted gait
speed reported as metres per minute to metres per second (Jaffe
2004)). Where possible, we conducted intention-to-treat analyses
to include all randomised participants and, where drop outs were
clearly identiﬁed for an outcome assessment, we used the actual
denominator of the participants contributing the data.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We pooled results to present an overall estimate of the treatment ef-
fect using a ﬁxed-effect model in the primary analysis. We assessed
heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plot. We quanti-
ﬁed inconsistency amongst studies using the I2 statistic (Higgins
2011), where we considered levels greater than 50% as substantial
heterogeneity. We used a random-effects model as part of a sensi-
tivity analysis.
Assessment of reporting biases
Our search of clinical trial registers assisted in reducing publication
bias. We also investigated selective outcome reporting through the
comparison of the methods section of papers with the results re-
ported and contacting authors to check whether additional out-
comes were collected. We inspected funnel plots for each of the
analyses; however, interpretation was limited due to the small sam-
ple sizes.
Data synthesis
Where there were acceptable levels of heterogeneity, we pooled
results. We usedthe ﬁxed-effectmodel with 95%CIusingRevMan
5.3 (RevMan 2014). We used a random-effects model as part of
a sensitivity analysis. Where meta-analysis was not appropriate
due to unacceptable heterogeneity, we have presented a narrative
summary of study results. We pooled outcomes measured with
different instruments using the SMD.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We attempted to perform subgroup analyses to determine whether
outcomes varied according to age, severity of stroke, time since
onset of stroke, dose of intervention (total hours of intervention)
and type of intervention (highly specialised program designed for
rehabilitation versus commercial gaming console). However, not
all of these analyses were possible due to the homogeneity of trial
participants. We were able to undertake subgroup analysis in some
cases for:
1. dosage of intervention (for upper limb function we
compared less than 15 hours intervention with more than 15
hours intervention and for lower limb function we compared less
than 10 hours intervention with more than 10 hours
intervention);
2. time since onset of stroke (less than or more than six
months);
3. type of intervention (specialised program or commercial
gaming console);
4. severity of impairment (upper limb).
Sensitivity analysis
We performed sensitivity analyses to determine whether there was
a difference in using a ﬁxed-effect model versus a random-effects
model.We conductedsensitivityanalyseswhere possible toexplore
the effects of the methodological quality of the included studies
on overall effect.

Results of the search
We identiﬁed 84 studies from searching the Cochrane Stroke
Group trials register and 8109 references from the database
searches, totaling 8193 references to studies. A search of the trials
registries elicited a further 51 potentially relevant studies. From
the 8244 titles and abstracts retrieved, we sought 198 of the arti-
cles in full text for further review. We grouped articles reporting
the same study. We removed articles that did not meet the inclu-
sion criteria, such as studies that used interventions that were not
considered virtual reality and non-randomised controlled trials.
We included a total of 37 studies. We have provided details on
17 excluded studies (Broeren 2008; Cameirao 2012; Cho 2013;
Chortis 2008; Cikaljo 2012; Der-Yeghiaian 2009; Edmans 2009;

in the Characteristics of excluded studies table, which were closest
to, but did not meet the inclusion criteria (Figure 1). We identiﬁed
nine ongoing studies (Characteristics of ongoing studies).

Included studies
We identiﬁed 37 randomised controlled trials, with a total of 1019
participants, which met the inclusion criteria. Of the 37 included
studies, we included 19 (with 565 participants) in the previous
version of this review and we identiﬁed 18 (with 454 participants)
in the updating process.
Sample characteristics
All trials, which were published in English, took place between
2004 and 2014. Twenty-two (59%) of the studies involved sample
sizes of fewer than 25 participants and three studies involved more
than 50 participants (Akinwuntan 2005; Kiper 2011; Lam 2006)
(Table 1). A total of 1019 participants post stroke were included
in the trials.
All studies included both male and female participants. Although
not always clearly reported, it appears that participants in the in-
cluded studies were relatively young, with studies reporting mean
ages of 46 to 75 years.
Inclusion criteria were clearly speciﬁed for 31 studies; ﬁve trials
recruited participants within three months of stroke (Akinwuntan
2005; Coupar 2012; da Silva Cameirao 2011; Kwon 2012; Piron
2007); one trial recruited within six months of stroke (Saposnik
2010); two trials recruited within 12 months (Kiper 2011; Yavuzer
2008); 17 trials recruited participants more than six months post
stroke (Byl 2013; Crosbie 2008; Housman 2009; Jaffe 2004; Jang
2005; Jung 2012; Kim 2009; Kim 2012; Mirelman 2008; Piron
2010; Sin 2013; Sucar 2009; Subramanian 2013; Yang 2008; Yang
2011; You 2005; Zucconi 2012). Time since onset of stroke was
notreportedinthe inclusioncriteriaforthe remaining studies.The
average recruitment time since stroke for each study is reported in
the Characteristics of included studies table.
Several trials excluded patients who were deemed medically unsta-
ble, though how this was determined was often unclear. Five trials
speciﬁed that people with a history of epilepsy or seizures would be
excluded (Akinwuntan 2005; Kim 2012; Mazer 2005; Saposnik
2010; Sin 2013). Most studies reported that patients with signif-
icant cognitive impairment would be excluded; however, this cri-
terion was often poorly deﬁned. Several studies listed the presence
of aphasia (Akinwuntan 2005; Coupar 2012; da Silva Cameirao
2011; Housman 2009; Kim 2011a; Kim 2011b; Kiper 2011;
Kwon 2012; Lam 2006; Mazer2005; Mirelman2008; Piron 2007;
Piron 2009; Piron 2010; Saposnik 2010; Shin 2013; Subramanian
2013; Yang 2008; Yavuzer 2008; Zucconi 2012), apraxia (Coupar
2012; Housman 2009; Kiper 2011; Lam 2006; Piron 2007; Piron
2009; Piron 2010; Subramanian 2013) and visual impairment
(Barcala 2013; Coupar 2012; Housman 2009; Jang 2005; Kang
2009; Kim2009; Kim2011b; Lam 2006; Piron 2007; Piron 2009;
Piron 2010; Rajaratnam 2013; Sin2013; Subramanian 2013; Yang
2008; Yang 2011; You 2005; Zucconi 2012) as exclusion criteria.
One study excluded people with computer-related phobias (Lam
2006). Studies involving upper limb training included patients
with a range of function including those with severe functional
impairment (Byl 2013; Coupar 2012; da Silva Cameirao 2011;
Kiper 2011; Shin 2013; Sin 2013). Studies involving lower limb
and gait training only involved patients that were able to walk
independently.
Although few studies provided clear details on participant recruit-
ment and withdrawal, data from eight studies showed that only
26% of the target population screened were recruited. Table 1
shows further details of recruitment and retention.
Interventions
Intervention approaches
Five intervention approaches were used: activity retraining, up-
per limb training, lower limb, balance and gait training, global
motor function training and cognitive/perceptual training. Four
trials involved activity retraining (Akinwuntan 2005; Mazer 2005
(automobile driving retraining); Jannink 2008 (scooter driving re-
training); Lam 2006 (retraining skills in using public transport)).
Eighteen trials involved upper limb training (Byl 2013; Coupar
2012; Crosbie 2008; da Silva Cameirao 2011; Housman 2009;
Kim 2012; Kiper 2011; Piron 2007; Piron 2009; Piron 2010;
Saposnik 2010; Shin 2013; Sin 2013; Standen 2011; Subramanian
2013; Sucar 2009; Yavuzer 2008; Zucconi 2012). Eight trials in-
volved lower limb, balance and gait training (Barcala 2013; Jaffe
2004; Jung 2012; Kim 2009; Mirelman 2008; Rajaratnam 2013;
Yang 2008; Yang 2011). Seven trials used the same virtual real-
ity program to improve global motor function (Cho 2012; Jang
2005; Kim 2009; Kim2011a; Kim 2011b; Kwon 2012; You 2005)
and one trial used a visual-perceptual retraining approach (Kang
2009).
Six of the studies used commercially available gaming consoles:
one study used the Playstation EyeToy (Yavuzer 2008), four stud-
ies used the Nintendo Wii (Barcala 2013; Kim 2012; Rajaratnam
2013; Saposnik 2010) and two studies used the Microsoft Kinect
(Rajaratnam 2013; Sin 2013). Seven studies used GestureTek
IREX, which is commercially available but more difﬁcult to ob-
tain and more expensive than off-the-shelf consoles (Cho 2012;
Jang 2005; Kim 2009; Kim 2011a; Kim 2011b; Kwon 2012; You
2005). One study used the Armeo (Coupar 2012) and one used
the CAREN system (Subramanian 2013), which are also com-
mercially available. The remaining studies used customised virtual
reality programs.

Setting
The majority of interventions were delivered in either an outpa-
tient or inpatient setting, although two of the studies delivered the
intervention in the participant’s own home (Piron 2009; Standen
2011). One of these studies used a telerehabilitation approach to
deliver the intervention (Piron 2009).
Amount of therapy provided
The total dose of therapy provided varied between studies. Six
studies provided less than ﬁve hours of total therapy (Barcala 2013;
Jannink 2008; Kim 2012; Shin 2013; Yang 2008; Yang 2011).
Thirteen studies provided between six and 10 hours of therapy
(Crosbie 2008; Jaffe 2004; Jung 2012; Kang 2009; Kim 2009;
Kim 2011a; Kim 2011b; Kwon 2012; Lam 2006; Saposnik 2010;
Sin 2013; Subramanian 2013; Yavuzer 2008). A further 14 studies
provided between 11 and 20 hours of therapy (Akinwuntan 2005;
Byl 2013; Cho 2012; da Silva Cameirao 2011; Jang 2005; Kiper
2011; Mazer 2005; Mirelman 2008; Piron 2009; Piron 2010;
Rajaratnam 2013; Sucar 2009; You 2005; Zucconi 2012) and
three studies provided more than 21 hours of therapy (Housman
2009; Piron 2007; Standen 2011). The remaining study, Coupar
2012, had three arms; one of the arms received lower intensity
therapy (four hours total) and another received higher intensity
therapy (10 hours total).
Comparison interventions
Most of the trials compared virtual reality intervention with a
comparable alternative intervention. The alternative intervention
was often described as therapy using a conventional approach. One
study allocated participants to either actively participating in the
virtual reality intervention or watching others participate in the
virtual reality intervention (Yavuzer 2008). Eleven of the studies
examined the effect of virtual reality when used alone (the control
group received no intervention) or as an adjunct (the control group
received usual care or rehabilitation) (Barcala 2013; Cho 2012;
Jang 2005; Kim 2011a; Kim 2012; Kwon 2012; Mazer 2005; Shin
2013; Sin 2013; Standen 2011; You 2005). There were ﬁve three-
armedtrialswith twocomparisoninterventions(Byl 2013; Coupar
2012; da Silva Cameirao 2011; Lam 2006; Zucconi 2012).
Outcomes
As a result of the diverse intervention approaches, a wide range
of outcome measures were used. Outcome measures for each of
the predeﬁned outcome categories are shown in Table 2. Due to
the heterogeneity of outcome measures, we were unable to in-
clude all of them in the analyses. With regard to timing of out-
come measurements, one study waited until ﬁve weeks after the
end of the intervention to collect outcome measures (Jannink
2008). All remaining studies measured outcomes soon post-in-
tervention. For studies including further follow-up, the time in-
terval until follow-up was generally at or less than three months
(Coupar 2012; Crosbie 2008; da Silva Cameirao 2011; Jaffe 2004;
Mirelman 2008; Piron 2009; Saposnik 2010; Subramanian 2013;
Yang 2008). Onlytwostudiesinvolvedlonger-termfollow-up: one
at six months (Housman 2009) and one at both six months and
ﬁve years (Akinwuntan 2005). Twelve studies reported on the pres-
ence or absence of adverse events (Byl 2013; Coupar 2012; Crosbie
2008; Housman 2009; Jaffe 2004; Kiper 2011; Piron 2007; Piron
2010; Saposnik 2010; Subramanian 2013; Sucar 2009; Yavuzer
2008).
Excluded studies
We provided details of the 17 studies that we excluded. We listed
studies as excluded if they were obtained in full text and required
discussion between authors to conﬁrm exclusion. Of the 17 stud-
ies nine were non-randomised trials, four did not meet the deﬁ-
nition of virtual reality and two compared different types of vir-
tual reality interventions rather than comparing virtual reality with
an alternative intervention or no intervention. We excluded two
studies for which we were unable to conﬁrm whether they met the
inclusion criteria based on information presented in a conference
abstract and the authors did not respond to two emails requesting
further information (Characteristics of excluded studies).

Not all included studies followed the CONSORT guidelines
(Schulz 2010), in which case we contacted the corresponding au-

a response from a corresponding author we recorded the ’Risk of
bias’ criterion as ’unclear’.
Allocation
Random sequence generation was reported as adequate in 28 trials
(76%) (Akinwuntan 2005; Barcala 2013; Byl 2013; Cho 2012;
Coupar 2012; Crosbie 2008; da Silva Cameirao 2011; Housman
2009; Jaffe 2004; Jung 2012; Kang 2009; Kim 2009; Kiper 2011;
Lam 2006; Mazer 2005; Mirelman 2008; Piron 2007; Piron 2009;
Piron 2010; Rajaratnam 2013; Saposnik 2010; Shin 2013; Sin
2013; Standen 2011; Subramanian 2013; Yang 2008; Yavuzer
2008; Zucconi 2012).
Allocation concealment was reported as adequate in 19 trials
(51%) (Akinwuntan 2005; Barcala 2013; Byl 2013; Coupar 2012;
Crosbie 2008; da Silva Cameirao 2011; Kim 2009; Kiper 2011;
Lam 2006; Mazer 2005; Mirelman 2008; Piron 2007; Piron
2009; Piron 2010; Shin 2013; Standen 2011; Subramanian 2013;
Yavuzer 2008; Zucconi 2012).
Blinding
Thirty trials (81%) reported blinding of the outcome assessor (
Akinwuntan 2005; Barcala2013; Byl2013; Coupar 2012; Crosbie
2008; da Silva Cameirao 2011; Housman 2009; Jaffe 2004; Jung
2012; Kang 2009; Kim 2009; Kim 2011b; Kwon 2012; Lam
2006; Mazer 2005; Mirelman 2008; Piron 2007; Piron 2009;
Piron 2010; Rajaratnam 2013; Saposnik 2010; Shin 2013; Sin
2013; Standen 2011; Subramanian 2013; Yang 2008; Yang 2011;
Yavuzer 2008; You 2005; Zucconi 2012). No trials were able to
blind participants or personnel.
Incomplete outcome data
We deemed 22 trials (59%) to be at low risk of bias in relation
to incomplete outcome data (Akinwuntan 2005; Barcala 2013;
Byl 2013; Coupar 2012; Crosbie 2008; Housman 2009; Jaffe
2004; Kang 2009; Kim 2009; Kim 2011a; Kim 2011b; Lam 2006;
Mazer 2005; Mirelman 2008; Piron 2009; Piron 2010; Saposnik
2010; Shin 2013; Subramanian 2013; Sucar 2009; Yavuzer 2008;
Zucconi 2012). Drop outs from studies appeared generally bal-
anced across groups.
Selective reporting
Trialists from 21 studies reported that their published data were
free of selective reporting (Akinwuntan 2005; Byl 2013; Coupar
2012; Crosbie 2008; da Silva Cameirao 2011; Housman 2009;
Kim 2009; Kim 2011a; Kim 2011b; Lam 2006; Mazer 2005;
Mirelman 2008; Piron 2007; Piron 2009; Piron 2010; Saposnik
2010; Shin 2013; Standen 2011; Subramanian 2013; Sucar 2009;
Zucconi 2012). It was unclear whether selective reporting was
present in the other studies.

Effects of interventions
See: Summary of ﬁndings for the main comparison Virtual
reality for stroke rehabilitation
Primary outcomes
We present results for upper limb function and activity.
Virtual reality versus conventional therapy: effect on upper
limb function and activity: post-intervention
Results are presented for upper limb function and activity and
hand function. All outcomes were taken within days of the end of
the intervention program.
Comparisons 1.1 and 1.2: Upper limb function and activity
Twelve studies presented outcomes for upper limb function and
activity (375 participants) (Byl 2013; Crosbie 2008; da Silva
Cameirao 2011; Housman 2009; Kiper 2011; Piron 2007; Piron
2009; Piron 2010; Saposnik 2010; Subramanian 2013; Sucar
2009; Zucconi 2012). The impact of virtual reality on upper limb
function showed a small signiﬁcant effect: standardised mean dif-
ference (SMD) 0.29, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.49
(Analysis 1.1). Statistical heterogeneity was low (I2 = 11%).
Sensitivity analysis
Analysis excluding the one trial that was quasi-randomised, Sucar
2009, found that the result on upper limb function remained
signiﬁcant although the effect was slightly smaller (SMD 0.28,
95% CI 0.08 to 0.49). Analysis excluding four studies that we
deemed to be at high risk of bias in one or more domains (da Silva
Cameirao 2011; Housman 2009; Piron 2007; Sucar 2009) showed
a trend towards improved upper limb function in the virtual reality
group. However, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (SMD
0.18, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.41).
Tenof the trials(with 363participants) used the Fugl MeyerUpper
Extremity (UE) Scale as an outcome measure (368 participants)
(Byl 2013; da Silva Cameirao 2011; Housman 2009; Kiper 2011;
Piron 2007; Piron 2009; Piron 2010; Subramanian 2013; Sucar
2009; Zucconi 2012). The impact of virtual reality as measured
by the Fugl Meyer UE Scale also showed a signiﬁcant effect: mean
difference (MD) 3.30, 95% CI 1.29 to 5.32 (Analysis 1.2). The
other two trials used the Action Research Arm Test (Crosbie 2008)
and Abbreviated Wolf Motor Function Test (Saposnik 2010) as
their measure of upper limb function and activity.
Comparison 1.3: Hand function
Two trials measured the effect of virtual reality versus alternative
therapy on grip strength (kg) (44 participants) (Housman 2009;
Saposnik 2010). The impact was not signiﬁcant: MD 3.55, 95%
CI -0.20 to 7.30 (Analysis 1.3). No statistical heterogeneity was
indicated.
Upper limb function: follow-up
Only Housman 2009 measured the longer-term effects of virtual
reality on upper limb function (more than three months after the
end of treatment). This study reported that participants in the
virtual reality group had improved signiﬁcantly more on the Fugl
Meyer UE Scale at the six-month follow-up assessment than par-
ticipants in the alternative treatment group (P value = 0.045). Par-
ticipants in the virtual reality group improved by 3.6 points (stan-
dard deviation (SD) 3.9) whereas participants in the alternative
treatment group improved by 1.5 points (SD 2.7). However, the
trial found no other signiﬁcant differences between groups at six
months on the other outcome measures used (Rancho Functional
Test, grip strength and Motor Activity Log).
Upper limb function: subgroup analyses
Comparison 2.1: Dose of treatment
We compared trials providing under 15 hours of intervention with
trials providing 15 hours or more of intervention. Trials provid-
ing less than 15 hours of intervention had a non-signiﬁcant effect
(SMD 0.24, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.62) whereas trials providing more
than 15 hours of intervention showed a small signiﬁcant effect
(SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.55). However, the difference be-
tween groups was not statistically signiﬁcant (Chi2 = 0.09, df = 1,
P value = 0.84) (Analysis 2.1).
Comparison 2.2: Time since onset of stroke
We classiﬁed trials based on whether their participants were re-
cruited within six months of stroke or more than six months post
stroke. The group recruited within six months of stroke showed
a moderate signiﬁcant effect (SMD 0.78, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.29)
whereas the group recruited more than six months after stroke did
not show a signiﬁcant effect (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.46)
although there was a trend towards the virtual reality intervention.
The difference between groups was signiﬁcant (Chi2 = 3.90, df =
1, P value = 0.05) (Analysis 2.2).
Comparison 2.3: Specialised virtual reality system or
commercial gaming console
15
Virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation (Review)

----- Page 19 (native) -----
We could include only one trial using a commercial gaming con-
sole in this analysis in comparison to six trials using specialised vir-
tual reality programs (Saposnik 2010). Both groups showed a sig-
niﬁcant effect on upper limb function (commercial gaming con-
soles: SMD 1.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.24 compared with specialised
system: SMD: 0.26, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.46) (Analysis 2.3). The test
for subgroup differences did not indicate signiﬁcance (P value =
0.12).
Comparison 2.4: Severity of upper limb impairment
We compared outcomes for people with mild to moderate upper
limb impairment and people with moderate to severe impairment.
The group with mild to moderate impairment showed a signif-
icant positive effect (SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.59) whereas
the group with moderate to severe impairment did not show a
signiﬁcant effect (SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.52) (Analysis
2.4). However, the difference between groups was not signiﬁcant
(P value = 0.41).
We did not undertake other planned subgroup analyses due to
similarities in these studies in regard to the age of participants and
frequency of intervention sessions.
Additional virtual reality intervention: effect on upper limb
function
We examined the effects of virtual reality intervention when it was
compared with no intervention or when it was used to augment
standard care (i.e. people in the virtual reality intervention group
received additional therapy time relative to the control group).
Comparison 3.1: Upper limb function
Nine studies with a total of 190 participants presented outcomes
for upper limb function (Cho 2012; Coupar 2012; Jang 2005;
Kim 2011a; Kwon 2012; Shin 2013; Sin 2013; Standen 2011;
Yavuzer 2008). There was a small to moderate signiﬁcant effect
that demonstrated that a virtual reality intervention was more
effective than no intervention: SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.73
(Analysis 3.1). There was no statistical heterogeneity.
Sensitivity analysis
We excluded trials that we deemed to be at high risk of bias in one
or more categories (Cho 2012; Kim 2011a; Standen 2011). The
result was consistent with the original analysis (SMD 0.48, 95%
CI 0.11 to 0.86).
Comparison 3.2: Hand function (dexterity)
Three studies with 60 participants reported on the effect of ad-
ditional virtual reality intervention on hand function (Jang 2005;
Sin 2013; Standen 2011). The effect was not signiﬁcant: SMD
0.25, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.77 (Analysis 3.2). Statistical heterogene-
ity was present (I2 = 38%).
Upper limb function: subgroup analyses
Comparison 4.1: Dose of treatment
We compared trials providing less than 15 hours of intervention
with trials providing 15 hours or more of intervention. Trials with
less than 15 hours of intervention had a signiﬁcant effect on upper
limb function (SMD 0.40, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75). Trials providing
more than 15 hours of intervention did not have a signiﬁcant
effect (SMD 0.54, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.07). The difference between
groups was not signiﬁcant (Chi2= 0.19, df = 1, P value = 0.67)
(Analysis 4.1).
Comparison 4.2 Time since onset of stroke
We compared trials recruiting participants within six months of
stroke with trials recruiting participants more than six months post
stroke. The difference between groups was not signiﬁcant (Chi2=
0.40, df = 1, P value = 0.53) (Analysis 4.2).
Comparison 4.3 Specialised virtual reality system or gaming
console
We compared two trials evaluating the efﬁcacy of gaming console
use with seven trials evaluating the efﬁcacy of virtual reality systems
speciﬁcally designed for rehabilitation. Gaming consoles were not
found to have a signiﬁcant effect (SMD 0.50, 95% CI -0.04 to
1.04) whereas specialised systems had a signiﬁcant effect (SMD
0.42, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76). The difference between groups was
not signiﬁcant (Chi2 = 0.06, df = 1, P value = 0.8) (Analysis 4.3).
Secondary outcomes
Virtual reality versus conventional therapy: Effect on gait
and balance activity: post-intervention
Results are presented for gait speed. All outcomes are taken within
days of the end of the intervention program and measured in
metres per second. We were unable to include four relevant studies;
one of these studies, Barcala 2013, compared different doses of
therapy and three studies did not report data in a format that
allowed pooling (Kim 2009; Rajaratnam 2013; Yang 2011).

----- Page 20 (native) -----
Comparison 4.1: Gait speed
Three studies provided data on gait speed (58 participants) (Jaffe
2004; Mirelman 2008; Yang 2008). The effect of virtual reality on
gait speed was not signiﬁcant: MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.23
(Analysis 5.1). No statistical heterogeneity was indicated. Jaffe
2004 examined the effect of virtual reality on comfortable walking
speed and fast walking speed. We included the data relating to
comfortable walking speed in the meta-analysis. The effect on
fast walking speed was found to be signiﬁcantly greater in the
virtual reality intervention group than the comparative group.
Jung 2012 reported outcomes as measured by the Timed Up and
Go Test. The study found a trend towards improved outcomes in
the virtual reality intervention group (Cohen’s d = 0.78). However,
the difference between groups was not statistically signiﬁcant.
Sensitivity analysis
We excluded the study that we deemed to be at high risk of bias in
one or more categories (Jaffe 2004). The result was non-signiﬁcant
(MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.33).
Gait and balance activity: follow-up
Only Mirelman 2008 measured the longer-term effects (at three
months) of virtual reality on gait speed. This study found that
the intervention group had signiﬁcantly improved outcomes at
follow-up.
Balance
Rajaratnam 2013 reported the effects of intervention on balance.
The study found no signiﬁcant improvements in balance function
within the experimental group.
Yang 2011 reported outcomes for gait and balance that could not
be pooled due to the nature of the outcome measures and the
way in which data were presented. The results showed no signif-
icant differences between groups for quiet stance but signiﬁcant
improvement within the virtual reality group for sit-to-stand and
aspects of level walking.
Gait and balance activity: subgroup analyses
Comparison 5.1: Effect of dose of treatment on gait speed
We compared two trials providing less than 10 hours of interven-
tion with one trial providing more than 10 hours of intervention.
Neither subgroup showed a signiﬁcant effect (trials providing less
than 10 hours intervention: MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.24, and
trial providing more than 10 hours intervention: MD 0.13, 95%
CI -0.09 to 0.35). The difference between subgroups was not sig-
niﬁcant (P value = 0.47) (Analysis 6.1).
We did not undertake other planned subgroup analyses due to ho-
mogeneity with regard to the age of participants, severity of stroke,
time since onset of stroke, frequency of intervention sessions and
type of virtual reality program.
Global motor function
Three studies reported outcomes for global motor function (using
the Modiﬁed Motor Assessment scale). However, Kim 2009 com-
pared virtual reality with an alternative intervention. We pooled
two studies (with 27 participants) that examined the effect of vir-
tual reality on global motor function when used in addition to
usual care, thus increasing the therapy dose received by the inter-
vention group (Kim 2012; You 2005). The effect on global motor
function was not signiﬁcant (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.90)
(Analysis 7.1).
Cognitive function
Insufﬁcient trials included assessments of cognition to allow us to
perform analysis for this outcome.
Activity limitation
Two studies reported outcomes of a driving evaluation. However,
we were unable to pool results as Akinwuntan 2005 compared
virtual reality intervention with an alternative intervention and
Mazer 2005 compared virtual reality intervention with no alterna-
tive intervention. Akinwuntan 2005 reported the results from the
follow-up assessments, which were completed at six months and
ﬁve years post-intervention. Six months post-intervention they
found that participants in the virtual reality intervention group
had improved signiﬁcantly more in their on-road performance
(measured by the Test Ride for Investigating Practical ﬁtness to
drive checklist) than participants in the alternative intervention
group (P value = 0.005). Furthermore, 73% of the virtual reality
group compared with 42% of the group that participated in driv-
ing-related cognitive tasks were classiﬁed by driving assessors as
’ﬁt to drive’ at six months. At ﬁve years, there was no signiﬁcant
difference between the groups in regards to ’ﬁtness to drive’ or
resumption of driving.
Results are presented for activities of daily living (ADL) function.
Comparison 7.1: Virtual reality versus conventional therapy:
effect on ADL function
Although none of the following study interventions targeted ADL
retraining speciﬁcally, eight studies (with 199 participants) mea-
sured the effects of virtual reality versus the same dose of alter-
native therapy on ADL function (Byl 2013; da Silva Cameirao
2011; Kang 2009; Kim 2011b; Kiper 2011; Piron 2007; Piron
2010; Zucconi 2012). The impact of intervention had a moderate
signiﬁcant effect: SMD 0.43, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.69 (Analysis 8.1).
Statistical heterogeneity was negligible (I2 = 2%).

Sensitivity analysis
We explored the effects of methodological quality on the overall
effect by excluding studies deemed to be at high risk of bias in
one or more categories from the analysis (da Silva Cameirao 2011;
Piron 2007). The results remained similar (SMD 0.39, 95% CI
0.10 to 0.67).
Comparison 8.1: Additional virtual reality intervention: effect
on ADL function
Eight studies (with 153 participants) reported outcomes for ADL
following virtual reality intervention where the therapy was pro-
vided in addition to usual care and thus the dose of therapy was
greater in the virtual reality group (Barcala 2013; Coupar 2012;
Kim 2011a; Kim 2012; Kwon 2012; Shin 2013; Standen 2011;
Yavuzer 2008). There was a small to moderate signiﬁcant effect:
SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.76 (Analysis 9.1).
Sensitivity analysis
We explored the effects of methodological quality on the effect by
excluding studies classiﬁed as being at high risk of bias in one or
more categories (Kim 2011b; Standen 2011). The result suggested
a smaller effect size and wider conﬁdence intervals (SMD 0.39,
95% CI 0.00 to 0.78).
Participation restriction and quality of life
Heterogeneity between trials and outcome measures used meant
that we did not perform analysis for this outcome.
Two of the studies assessed whether intervention was associated
with changes on the Stroke Impact Scale (Byl 2013; Saposnik
2010). These studies were not pooled as the treatment of the con-
trol group differed substantially. Neither of the studies reported
between-group differences on the scale.
Four of the studies examined effect of intervention on the ’amount
of use’ scale within the Motor Activity Log. There were differ-
ences in the intervention approaches examined. One of the stud-
ies examined whole body physical retraining (Jang 2005), whereas
the other studies speciﬁcally examined upper limb retraining. In
addition, one of the studies used virtual reality in addition to
usual care and thus increased the therapy dose in the intervention
group (Standen 2011), whereas the other two studies compared
training in a virtual environment with an alternative intervention
(Housman 2009; Subramanian 2013). While one of the studies re-
ported no signiﬁcant difference between groups (Housman 2009),
three of the studies reported that there were greater improvements
in the intervention group than the control group on the ’amount

Voxels or regions of interest identiﬁed via imaging
We did not perform meta-analysis for this outcome as the two
studiesincludingimagingstudiesasanoutcome measure hadsmall
sample sizes (total of 20 participants for both studies) and com-
pared virtual reality with no intervention (Jang 2005; You 2005).
The variablesinthese studieswere the lateralityindexandactivated
voxels. Jang 2005 reported that following intervention all partici-
pants in the intervention group showed signiﬁcantly increased ip-
silesional activation (measured by number of voxels activated) at
the primary sensorimotor cortex area during affected elbow move-
ment. You 2005 reported that in the primary sensorimotor cortex
the laterality index in the virtual reality group showed a signiﬁcant
increase as a function of the intervention and in comparison to
the control group who received no intervention.
Adverse events
Twelve studies monitored and reported on adverse events. Ten
studies reported no signiﬁcant adverse events (Byl 2013; Coupar
2012; Housman 2009; Jaffe 2004; Kiper 2011; Piron 2007; Piron
2010; Saposnik 2010; Subramanian 2013; Yavuzer 2008). Crosbie
2008 found that two people in the virtual reality group reported
side effects of transient dizziness and headache, and Sucar 2009
found that three participants in the virtual reality group reported
pain caused by the treatment in contrast to two participants in the
conventional therapy group.

Summary of main results
This review included 37 trials with 1019 participants. The main
results are presented in the ’Summary of ﬁndings’ table (Summary
of ﬁndings for the main comparison).
Upper limb function and activity
Twelve trials with 397 participants compared virtual reality inter-
vention with conventional therapy and measured effects on upper
limb function. These trials used 10 different virtual reality pro-
grams and all interventions were delivered in a hospital or clinic
setting, with the exception of one trial that used a home-based tel-
erehabilitation approach. The majority of trials recruited patients
more than six months after stroke, with only three trials recruiting
patients within the ﬁrst six months of stroke. In addition, only one
study included in the analysis evaluated the effects of a commercial
gaming console.
Two trials compared virtual reality intervention with conventional
therapy and measured hand function (using grip strength). How-
ever, there was considerable heterogeneity between these studies
in regard to the time since onset of stroke in which patients were
recruited, the dose of therapy and the type of intervention (spe-
cialised program compared with commercial gaming console).

We also examined the effect of a virtual reality intervention on up-
per limb function when the intervention was provided to augment
the usual dose of therapy. Thus, the intervention group received
more therapy time than the control group. Nine studies with 190
participants found a moderate signiﬁcant effect in favour of the
intervention. Seven of these studies involved the use of commer-
cially available virtual reality programs and one of the studies pro-
vided the intervention in the home setting.
In summary, these studies showed that the addition of a virtual
reality intervention to usual care resulted in improvements in up-
per limb function. Furthermore, a virtual reality intervention was
a more effective approach than conventional interventions and
achieved more improvement in upper limb function although the
effect size was small. Results showed that there were beneﬁts when
the intervention was conducted in the ﬁrst six months of stroke
but not when conducted more than six months after stroke, sug-
gesting that a virtual reality intervention is most useful in the sub-
acute phase of rehabilitation. In addition, results suggested that
higher doses of therapy (programs involving more than 15 hours
of therapy) were more beneﬁcial. We found insufﬁcient evidence
to draw conclusions on the effect of a virtual reality approach on
grip strength.
Secondary outcomes
Three trials with 58 participants measured gait speed and could be
included in the analysis. Two of these trials used treadmill training
whereas the other study used a force feedback program designed to
elicit improved movement and control at the ankle. Participants
in the studies were more than one year post stroke. There was
insufﬁcient evidence to draw conclusions on whether a virtual
reality approach was more effective in improving gait speed than
conventional therapy. Three trials using the same virtual reality
program measured global motor function. Two of these studies
examined the effect of additional therapy (in the form of virtual
reality intervention). However, the effect on global motor function
was not signiﬁcant. There was a small to moderate signiﬁcant effect
on ADL. We were unable to pool results for cognitive function,
participation restriction and quality of life or imaging studies.
There were few adverse events reported across studies and those
reported (transient dizziness, headache, pain) were relatively mild.
Heterogeneity of included studies
There was considerable clinical heterogeneity between the studies
included in the review, particularly in regard to the variety of in-
tervention approaches used to address a variety of different patient
needs. Some of these interventions were very speciﬁc (for example,
retraining participants to use the local public transport system)
and therefore studies were not comparable in many circumstances.
In addition, a wide variety of outcome measures were used; this
also limited our ability to pool results. The use of meta-analysis in
cases where such heterogeneity is present can be considered con-
troversial (Higgins 2011); however, we felt that meta-analysis in
this review was justiﬁed and we were careful only to pool studies
that were relatively comparable in terms of participants, interven-
tions, comparison and outcome measures. Meta-analysis of the in-
dividual studies enabled us to explore the overall treatment effect
of the intervention when compared with an alternative more tra-
ditional intervention or no intervention. Our sensitivity analyses
suggested that there were no notable differences between using
random-effects and ﬁxed-effect models.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Although we identiﬁed 37 studies, the sample sizes of the included
studies were generally small. The studies included in our previous
review predominantly recruited patients more than six months af-
ter stroke whereas in this review there are a larger number of stud-
ies recruiting patients within the ﬁrst few months. Patients with
cognitive impairment or communication or visual deﬁcits were
often excluded, thereby raising questions about how applicable
this intervention is to a wide range of stroke survivors. Further-
more, the average age of participants in the included studies was
relatively low, therefore, it is unclear how acceptable or effective
this approach may be with older stroke survivors. Researchers in-
volved in future studies should provide more detail in their report-
ing, ensuring they clearly describe their eligibility criteria, consent
rate and the adherence and satisfaction of participants with the
intervention. These details will be of interest to clinicians who will
need to weigh up the cost of the virtual reality program with the
potential beneﬁts and the number of clients who may beneﬁt from
use.
In contrast to our previous review in which most of the virtual
reality programs were speciﬁcally designed for rehabilitation pur-
poses, this review has found a rise in the number of studies evaluat-
ing commercial gaming programs designed for the general popu-
lation. Yet it remains difﬁcult to examine the effects of game-based
interventions as the approach and gaming consoles used vary. It
seems that most studies are still at the level of testing feasibility
(Thomson 2014).
Several trials reported on the presence or absence of adverse events.
There were few events reported; the small number of events were
mild and limited to dizziness, headache and pain.
Quality of the evidence
While we were able to include a relatively large number of studies
in the review, sample sizes in the included studies were small and
larger, adequately powered studies are required to conﬁrm initial
ﬁndings. The risk of bias present in many studies was unclear due
to poor reporting and lack of clariﬁcation from study authors.

Approximately half of the studies reported adequate allocation
concealment, andinfourof the includedstudiesitwasunclearas to
whether there was blinding of outcome assessors. Thus, while there
are a large number of randomised controlled trials, the evidence
remains ’low’ or ’very low’ quality when rated using the GRADE
system.
Potential biases in the review process
While our search strategy was comprehensive, it is possible that
some studies were not identiﬁed in the search process, for example
studies where there is no published abstract in English. Whilst
in the previous version of this review we contacted manufactur-
ers of virtual reality equipment and searched conference proceed-
ings, we opted not to do so in this update as this method was
not previously effective in eliciting original studies. However, this
does mean that unpublished data may not have been identiﬁed.
Furthermore, although we contacted all corresponding authors of
included studies, not all authors responded. This resulted in the
study methodology of some trials being unclear (Cho 2012; Jang
2005; Jannink 2008; Jung 2012; Kang 2009; Kim 2011a; Kim
2011b; Kim 2012; Rajaratnam 2013; Yang 2008; You 2005), and
resulted in us being unable to include some data in the analyses.
The process of two review authors independently reviewing ab-
stracts and extracting data (with a third review author to moderate
disagreements) enabled us to minimise bias. The search date of
this review was October 2013. As this ﬁeld is rapidly expanding
there are likely to be more studies now eligible for inclusion.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Previous systematic reviews have argued that virtual reality appears
promising (Crosbie 2007; Lohse 2014; Moreira 2013; Saposnik
2011). This review is consistent with these reviews; however, due
to the more recent and comprehensive search strategy we were
able to identify a greater number of studies and conduct subgroup
analyses. The ﬁndings in this update are consistent with the ﬁnd-
ings of our initial review although the updated effect sizes were
smaller for upper limb function and ADL function. In addition,
this review provided new information about the effectiveness of
virtual reality when used as an adjunct to conventional rehabilita-
tion.

Implications for practice
We found low quality evidence that virtual reality is a safe inter-
vention that is effective at improving arm function and activities
of daily living (ADL) function following stroke. The evidence, al-
beit limited, suggests that improvements in function are greatest
when a greater dose of therapy is delivered. In addition, it appears
that patients with low to moderate upper limb impairment, and
who are less than six months post stroke, may have the greatest
beneﬁt. Gains made appear to be clinically signiﬁcant with analy-
ses showing reasonable effect sizes (that is, a small effect on upper
limb function (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.29) and a
small to moderate effect on ADL function (SMD 0.43)). How-
ever, at present, there is signiﬁcant heterogeneity between studies.
For example, there are only two studies that have examined the use
of a virtual reality driving simulation program and thus it is un-
clear how effective virtual reality may be for driver rehabilitation
after stroke. In addition, as virtual reality interventions may vary
greatly (from inexpensive commercial gaming consoles to expen-
sive customised programs), it is unclear which characteristics of
the intervention are most important. Our analyses did not provide
clear direction as to which virtual reality programs are superior
to others. Studies that compare different conﬁgurations of virtual
reality were excluded from this review but are now beginning to
provide more information regarding the comparative effectiveness
of different programs (Cameirao 2012; Fluet 2013).
Furthermore, the applicability of the intervention to stroke sur-
vivors needs further research in terms of which type of approach
is best suited to the individual patient and how acceptable the
technology may be to stroke survivors. Clinicians who currently
have access to virtual reality programs should be reassured that
their use as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program ap-
pears reasonable, taking into account the patient’s goals, abilities
and preferences.
The lack of adverse events, including motion sickness, nausea,
headache or pain, suggests that these factors should not be of
great concern to clinicians; however, this may vary depending on
the characteristics of the person, the virtual reality hardware and
software and the task.
Implications for research
This updated version of the review revealed that 18 new ran-
domised controlled trials (RCTs) were published over approxi-
mately three years. However, the sample sizes and methodological
quality of the new RCTs mirror those included in the previous re-
view. Researchers in this ﬁeld are strongly encouraged to conduct
larger, adequately powered trials that can provide more deﬁnitive
results.
Researchers and manufacturers designing new virtual reality pro-
grams for rehabilitation purposes should include the use of pilot
studies assessing usability and validity as part of the development
process. This is an important part of the development process and
should be conducted with the intended users of the program.
Our review included only RCTs, resulting in the exclusion of ob-
20

----- Page 24 (native) -----
servational studies that showed improvements in real-world tasks
based on virtual reality training. It is evident that the ﬁeld is still
developing and many studies are at feasibility and proof-of-con-
cept levels. In addition, it is challenging to design a controlled trial
comparing virtual reality to real-world correlates. This is in part
because virtual reality systems allow us to train in ways that are
not possible in the real world. Future research needs to carefully
examine what we control for when comparing real-world with vir-
tual reality-based interventions and overcome, when possible, the
challenge of making groups equivalent.
Ideally, studies should use common outcome measures. However,
this is likely to be difﬁcult due to the range of virtual reality inter-
ventions. Studies should measure whether effects are long lasting
with outcome assessment more than three months after the end
of the intervention. Researchers should also examine the impact
of virtual reality on the person’s motivation to participate in reha-
bilitation, engagement in therapy and level of enjoyment.
Many of the studies included in this review did not report the
number of participants screened against eligibility criteria. Future
research trials should report these data as they provide useful in-
formation regarding the proportion of stroke survivors for whom
virtual reality intervention may be appropriate.
The majority of studies to date have evaluated interventions that
were designedtoaddressmotorimpairments. There are few studies
that include cognitive rehabilitation or studies that aim to make
improvements at the levels of activity or participation. There is also
currently insufﬁcient evidence from RCTs to tell whether activity
training in a virtual environment translates to activity performance
in the real world.
One of the key potential advantages of using virtual reality pro-
grams is that they could be used without the need for direct ther-
apist supervision. For example, they could be used alone in the
home environment or in a group setting with supervision from
therapy aids as a way of increasing therapy dose without increasing
stafﬁng. There are few research studies that have examined virtual
reality interventions in this way, yet this is one of the most desir-
able characteristics of this approach.

Methods
RCT
Participants
Recruited via the University of California, USA
15 participants completed the study: 5 intervention, 5 intervention, 5 control
Inclusion criteria: stroke survivors more than 6 months post stroke between 25 and
75 years of age. Participants were independent in self care and independent in the
community with minimal to moderate voluntary function in the upper limb (Upper
Limb Fugl Meyer score 16 to 39). Participants needed to speak English or attend with
an interpreter
Exclusion criteria: people were excluded if they suffered from a neurological disease other
than stroke, had co-morbidities that would impact on participation, were in severe pain,
were not mentally alert or had a skin condition that would prevent wearing the robotic
orthosis
Mean (SD) age: intervention group 65.2 (5.4), control group 54.2 (20.5)
Stroke details: 70% right hemiparesis
Timing post stroke: intervention group 8.4 (4.2), control group 10.2 (5.0) months
Interventions
This trial had 3 arms: 2 of the intervention groups performed virtual reality tasks; 1
of the virtual reality groups performed bilateral tasks and the other group performed
unilateral tasks
Virtual reality intervention: the participant wore a robotic orthosis. Each session started
with a motor control evaluation task and then followed with treatment in which partic-
ipants performed repetitive movements while playing task-speciﬁc games
Control intervention: repetitive task practice involved reaching, grasping, object manip-
ulation and self care activities. Dynamic orthoses were not included in training
Sessions were 90 minutes for 12 treatment sessions (approximately 18 hours total)
Outcomes
Outcomes recorded at baseline and post-intervention
Upper limb function outcomes: Fugl Meyer, Motor Proﬁciency Speed (abbreviated Wolf
Motor Function Test and Digital Reaction Time Test)

Interventions
Virtual reality intervention: Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS). The main elements
of the system are the vision based analysis and tracking system that capture upper limb
movements through colour detection, data gloves to capture ﬁnger ﬂexion and a virtual
environment where an avatar mimics the movements of the user
Control intervention (occupational therapy): occupational therapy with emphasis on
motor tasks similar to those in the RGS (i.e. object displacement, grasp and release)
Control intervention (Wii): used the Wii gaming system. This intervention involved the
gaming features but not the neuro-scientiﬁc hypothesis regarding recovery

6 (1.6) months
Interventions
Virtual reality intervention: magnetic receivers were positioned on the participant’s arm.
As the participant grasped and moved real objects, software created a virtual environment
which displayed virtual handling and target objects, for example an envelope and a
mailbox, a hammer and a nail, a glass and a carafe. While performing the virtual tasks such
as putting the envelope in the mailbox the participant moves the real envelope and sees
on screen the trajectory of the corresponding virtual objects toward the virtual mailbox.
Participants could see not only their own movement but also the correct trajectory that
they had to execute, pre-recorded by the therapist. This allowed participants to easily
perceive motion errors and adjust them during the task
Control intervention: ’conventional’ rehabilitation focused on the upper limb
Sessions were 60 minutes, 5 times a week for 5 to 7 weeks (approximately 25 to 35 hours
total)

object displayed on the screen in accordance with the requested virtual task. 5 virtual
tasks comprising simple arm movements were devised for training

the researchers. Movements of the participant’s upper limbs are tracked by a camera and
the person interacts with on-screen games. Games included shopping in the supermarket,
making breakfast, playing basketball, cleaning, painting and driving
Control intervention: a variety of exercises guided by the therapist using equipment such
as cones and balls
Sessions were 60 minutes, 3 times a week for 5 weeks (15 hours total)
Outcomes
Outcomes recorded at baseline and post-intervention
Upper limb function and activity outcomes (arm): Fugl Meyer UE scale, Motricity Index
Adverse events reported
Other outcomes: level of interest, competence, effort, pressure and utility of the inter-
vention

Methods
RCT
Participants
Study took place in Taiwan
24 participants: 12 intervention, 12 control
Inclusion criteria: hemiparesis resulting from a single stroke occurring > 6 months ear-
lier, limited household walker, unlimited household walker or most-limited community
walker by functional walking category, not presently receiving any rehabilitation services,
no visual ﬁeld deﬁcit or hemianopia, stable medical condition to allow participation
in the testing protocol and intervention, ability to understand instructions and follow
commands
Exclusion criteria: any comorbidity or disability other than stroke that would preclude
gait training, uncontrolled health condition for which exercise was contraindicated,
neurological or orthopaedic disease that might interfere with the study
Mean (SD) age: intervention group 55 (12) years, control group 61 (9) years
50% male
Stroke details: 45% right hemiparesis
Timing post stroke: intervention group mean (SD) 6 (4) years, control group 6 (10)
years
Interventions
Virtual reality intervention: the participant walked on a treadmill as virtual environments
were displayed on a screen in front of the person with a wide ﬁeld of view. Speed and
incline of the treadmill was able to be varied in conjunction with scenery changes. Leg
movements were tracked by an electromagnetic system to detect collisions with virtual
objects. The virtual environment was designed to simulate a typical community in Taipei.
Scenarios consisted of lane walking, street crossing, negotiating obstacles and strolling
through the park
Control intervention: treadmill training. While walking on the treadmill the participant
was asked to execute different tasks. The tasks included lifting the legs to simulate
stepping over obstacles, uphill and downhill walking and fast walking
Sessions were 20 minutes, 3 times a week for 3 weeks (3 hours total)

The protocol stated that we would handsearch conference proceedings and contact manufacturers of virtual reality equipment. We
conducted these searches for the 2010 review. However, they were not successful in identifying additional studies for inclusion and
therefore were not repeated in the 2013 review.
The protocol stated that we would assess trials for risk of bias related to blinding of participants and personnel. We assessed blinding
of participants and personnel in the 2010 review. As expected, we deemed all the studies included in the 2010 review to be at high risk
of bias. As blinding is not possible in most cases we decided to omit this domain of the ’Risk of bias’ assessment tool in this update of
the review.
The protocol listed three primary outcomes. This review identiﬁed upper limb function and activity as being the primary outcome and
considered all other outcomes as secondary outcomes. We selected upper limb function and activity as the primary outcome as one of
the most common applications of virtual reality in stroke rehabilitation is upper limb rehabilitation.
