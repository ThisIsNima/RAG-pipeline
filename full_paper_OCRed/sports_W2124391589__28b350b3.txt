Introduction 
There are a number of labels to describe the young people currently studying at school, college 
and university. They include the digital natives, the net generation, the Google generation or the 
millenials. All of these terms are being used to highlight the significance and importance of new 
technologies within the lives of young people (Gibbons, 2007).  For some, new technologies have 
been such a defining feature in the lives of younger generations that they predict a fundamental 
change in the way young people communicate, socialise, create and learn. They argue that this 
shift has profound implications for education (e.g. Prensky, 2001a; Gibbons, 2007; Rainie, 2006 
and Underwood, 2007). Typically, supporters of this concept view the differences between those 
who are or who are not digital natives as primarily about when a person was born. This paper will 
critique and show new evidence against this conception of the digital native as based purely on 
generational differences. The paper will separate the ‘doing’ from the ‘being’, that is it will propose 
a number of digital activities (doing) that indicate digital nativeness and then examine which types 
of people (being) are most likely to demonstrate these characteristics. The paper will show that 
breadth of use, experience, self-efficacy and education are just as, if not more, important than 
age in explaining how people become digital natives.  
 
Prior to presenting the findings, it is useful to provide a brief review of the literature on this topic. 
The central argument to support the concept of the digital native is that young people born in the 
last two decades have always been surrounded by, and interacted with, new technologies.  
According to Prensky, one of the more radical consequences of this technology rich environment 
is a hypothesized change in the brain structure that means young people think and process 
information in fundamentally different ways compared to older generations (Prensky, 2001a; 
Prensky, 200b). He explains, “Digital Natives are used to receiving information really fast. They 
like to parallel process and multi-task. They prefer their graphics before their text rather than the 
opposite. They prefer random access (like hypertext). They function best when networked. They 
thrive on instant gratification and frequent rewards. They prefer games to “serious” work

(2001a:1). Prensky defines this younger generation as the digital natives as they, are all “native 
speakers” of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet” (2001a:1).  
 
Prensky refers to people who were born before this new digital era, which began around 1980, as 
Digital Immigrants. According to him digital immigrants may learn to use new technologies but will 
still be in some way located within the past, unable to fully understand the natives. Prensky likens 
this to the difference between learning a new language and being a native speaker. According to 
him, characteristics of digital immigrants include: not going to the Internet first for information, 
printing things out as opposed to working on screen, and reading manuals rather than working 
things out online. The supporters of this concept suggest that the differences between these two 
groups have profound implications for education. They argue that young people now have a 
range of different preferences, tools and ways of processing and using information that do not fit 
well with current educational practices. Thus, the current pedagogies employed in education need 
to change. For example, Prensky suggests that educators now need to communicate in a way 
that fits with needs of the digital natives i.e., “going faster, less step-by step, more in parallel, with 
more random access, among other things”. (2001a:2). A powerful teaching method, Prensky 
suggests, would be to use computer games to teach the digital natives. Supporters of this view 
see a gap or “digital disconnect” between students and teachers (Underwood, 2007) that is 
difficult to bridge. In Prensky’s terms, the natives are being taught by immigrants who are, in 
effect, not talking the same language (Prensky, 2001a). 
 
The use of the digital native term has become popular in public and political debate. A quick 
Google search using this term provides 910 hits for UK websites created in the last year (17,400 
worldwide) and a Nexis search throws up 48 UK newspaper articles that used this term in the last 
year (114 world wide in English language newspapers).  In comparison, Web of Science only 
 
2

----- Page 4 (native) -----
cites 2 and Scopus only 12 academic articles which ever mentioned this term1. This suggests that 
while the term is popular, there is not much academic research in this area.  
 
In fact there is very little evidence that young people are radically different in the ways they use 
and process information (Bennet et al., 2008). To justify his claims Prensky draws on the widely 
held theory of neuroplasticity, which, simply put, suggests our brains are plastic, flexible and 
subject to change throughout life in response to changes in the environment. Thus young 
people’s brains have developed differently to adults as they have grown up in a world surrounded 
by new technologies. However, it is not yet known what differences (if any) there are in the brain 
structure of adults and young people who use the Internet and other new technologies.  As 
Prensky himself admits, exactly how the brain is changing as a result of growing up with and 
using technology and the implications this has for cognitive processes associated with learning 
are still being explored by neuroscientists (Prensky, 2001b).  
 
There is a growing body of academic research that has questioned the validity of the generational 
interpretation of the digital native concept. Those in support of this digital native / immigrant 
distinction tend to assign broad characteristics (e.g. a specific learning style, amount and type of 
technology use and / or set of learning preferences) to an entire generation (Bennet et al., 2008) 
and suggest all young people are expert with technology. Yet, while the proportion of young 
people who use the Internet and other new technologies is higher than the older population (e.g. 
Dutton and Helsper, 2007; Cheong, 2008) there are significant differences in how and why young 
people use these new technologies and how effectively they use them (e.g.  DiMaggio and 
Hargittai, 2001; Facer & Furlong 2001;Hargittai and Hinnart, 2008; Livingstone & Helsper, 2007). 
Indeed, a number of writers have highlighted the complexity and diversity of use of new 
technologies by young people which tends to be ignored or minimized in many arguments in 
support of the digital native.

A second, equally important aspect of this debate is the extent to which the differences between 
digital natives and digital immigrants can be explained by generational differences. For Prensky, 
age seems to be the defining factor. For Tapscott (1998) who refers to the “generation lap” (i.e. 
technology is the one place where young people are better than older people) a digital native is 
defined by exposure to, or experience with, technology. For some writers it appears it does not 
matter a great deal if it is age or experience which defines if someone is a digital native or part of 
the net generation (Oblinger and Oblinger, 2005).  
 
However, whether the extent to which a person is a digital native is about date of birth or about a 
certain amount of exposure, experience or expertise with new technologies, is an important 
question for policy and practice. If characteristics of a digital native are determined by age then 
older generations are lost and a solution to a ‘digital disconnect’ between adults and younger 
people is out of sight. However, if being tech savvy is determined by exposure and experience 
then collaboration and learning is possible in environments where younger and older generations 
interact. The distinction between generational and experience aspects of ‘digital nativeness’ has 
been less well researched because the majority of previous studies examining young people’s 
use of technology tend to focus on young people and their parents (e.g. studies by Livingstone 
and Bober (2005) and Facer et al., 2003)) not young people as part of the wider population. In 
addition, the vast majority of the evidence cited in support of the concept of the digital native is 
based on data from the United States. Before educational policy makers and practitioners begin 
to change the educational system in the UK in response to these claims we need more empirical 
evidence to inform the debate (Kennedy, et al., 2008). 
 
This paper aims to add to this discussion by providing evidence on how the British population 
access and use the Internet and other new technologies from a nationally representative face-to-
face survey (the Oxford Internet Surveys). While this cannot tell us anything about the structure of 
the brain or cognitive processes, this data enables us to explore and test the basic assumptions 
of the digital native / digital immigrant concept. An answer to this question will inform the extent to 
 
4

----- Page 6 (native) -----
which it is possible to get teachers to “talk the same language” as their students, add to the 
debate about what and how we should be educating young people and has implications for the 
current policies to support family learning i.e. the extent to which carers and parents can support 
their children using new technologies in the home.  
 
Specifically, we will untangle the different aspects of what a native is by exploring whether acting 
like a digital native is determined by: 
  
1) age – the youngest generation who has grown up with technology and does not know 
any other context 
2) experience – those who have been on the Internet the longest, while they might not have 
grown up with the Internet when young, they have been ‘submerged’ in it for the longest 
period of time; or 
3) breadth of use – those for whom the Internet is integrated into almost every aspect of 
their everyday lives independent of their age or experience. 
 
In this paper we examine this by exploring the importance of these three variables in determining 
if someone is a digital native. While an exact definition of being a digital native is not often 
presented in the literature we define it here as someone who multi-tasks, has access to a range 
of new technologies, is confident in their use of technologies, uses the Internet as a first port of 
call for information and – given the educational focus of this article - uses the Internet for learning 
as well as other activities.  
Method 
The data upon which this article is based is taken from the 2007 Oxford Internet Survey (OxIS), 
carried out by the Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford) which provides authoritative 
information on Internet use and non-use in Britain. The surveys are multistage probability sample 
surveys of individuals 14 years and older, and are carried out face to face. The 2007 survey was 
 
5

----- Page 7 (native) -----
conducted during March and April 2007 with 2,350 respondents (a response rate of 77%) of 
which 1,578 were Internet users.  Areas covered in the survey include information about: Internet 
users (who uses / doesn't use the Internet, and how they gain access to it); Internet uses 
(including e-learning, e-government, e-entertainment and e-finance); and impacts of the Internet 
on everyday life (including changing habits and practices, privacy concerns and attitudes to 
technology).  
 
In this paper we make the distinction between those who are more and less comfortable with the 
Internet. We focus just on those who have some exposure to the technology and do not focus on 
non-Internet users or ex-users. For a more detailed discussion of non-users please see Dutton 
and Helsper (2007). Since young people are currently more likely to use the Internet than the 
elderly and retired this influences the final sample and this will be taken into consideration in the 
conclusions drawn in this paper.  
 
We start this paper by carrying out descriptive analyses of age, experience and breadth of use in 
relation to media richness of the household (i.e. the number of ICTs in the household), their level 
of Internet self-efficacy, if someone goes to the Internet first for information, if they multitask and 
what they use the Internet for. OxIS asks a number of questions about the kinds of activities 
people carry out online and from these twelve general categories of Internet uses were 
constructed based on an exploratory factor analyses. The following twelve types of Internet use 
were identified: fact checking, training, current affairs and Interests, travel, finance, shopping, 
entertainment, social networking, diary functions, person to person networking, e-government and 
civic participation (see Helsper, Dutton & Gerber 2009).  
 
As this analysis did not provide a clear answer to our question we then carried out a series of 
linear regressions to identify the variables that explain who has the most media rich household, 
who has high levels of Internet self-efficacy, who goes to the Internet first for information, who 
multitasks and who is more likely to use the Internet for learning. All of the twelve different types 
 
6

----- Page 8 (native) -----
of Internet use identified from the factor analysis could arguably be seen as indicators of learning. 
However, there are three factors that seem most directly related to learning and education: fact 
checking (using the Internet to look up a definition of a word or checking a fact); training and 
learning (looking for jobs, distance learning for an academic degree, getting information for a 
school related project, getting information for a work related project, finding out opportunities for 
further study) and current affairs and interests searching (news, sports, local events, health). 
These three factors were chosen for the linear regression because they seem the most closely 
related to potential learning opportunities and thus most relevant to the focus of this paper. 
Results  
As noted above we explored the significance of generation, experience and breadth of use in 
defining a digital native. Prior to utilizing these variables it is valuable to define them and examine 
the relationship between them. 
 
Age is a self explanatory variable, nevertheless since the concept of the digital native is so 
closely linked to generations it is important to define which generation is considered digitally 
native. Prensky’s original definition considered those born after 1980 digitally native, but in most 
of the recent literature this category seems to have shifted. Arguably the rise of web 2.0 
applications might have created a second generation of digital natives which can be separated 
from the first due to their familiarity and immersion in this new, web 2.0, digital world. The current 
generation of teenagers born after 1990 (currently 18 or younger) is here identified as second 
generation digital natives, while the young adults born between 1983 and 1990 (currently 
between 18 and 25 years old) are considered the first generation of digital natives. 
 
It is important to define what we mean by experience and breadth of use. Experience is 
operationalised as years of using the Internet. Breadth of use is operationalised as the number of 
different activities a person undertakes online. Breadth of use was calculated based on a factor 
analyses of all the uses of the Internet measured in OxIS (see Helsper, Dutton & Gerber 2009) 
 
7

----- Page 9 (native) -----
and then summing all these activities into a scale from 0 to 12.  Since we are looking at Internet 
users only the scale runs from 1 to 12 because they undertake at least 1 of the 12 types of 
activities on the Internet. In addition, OxIS measures an individual’s level of self-efficacy (how 
good are you at using the internet?)  to have a subjective indicator of expertise. 
 
Descriptive analyses of OxIS showed that breadth and self-efficacy were strongly correlated with 
age, but experience was not. That is, younger generations might have expertise, measured by a 
wide range of uses (r=-.17; p<.01) and high levels of self-efficacy (r=-.20; p<.01), but they have 
not necessarily spent more or less years using the Internet (r=.02; p=.45).  The latter is important 
because it offers an opportunity to understand the differential effect of experience and generation 
on the ‘digital nativeness’ of an individual by comparing people of different age groups with the 
same number of years of experience. 
 
 
Let us first look at each of these three variables more closely in relation to those factors that we 
earlier earmarked as indicators of digital nativeness: use of the Internet, media richness, the 
importance of the Internet as an information source and types of Internet use. That is the extent 
to which generation, experience or breadth of use can help us to define digital “nativeness”.   
Generation 
[TABLE 1 HERE] 
 
Looking at the population as a whole, younger people were more likely to be digital natives as 
they have a wider variety of ICTs at home and were more likely to be Internet users (see Table 
1). Interestingly the biggest drop in the proportion of Internet users was when users were over 55 
years old, which means that majority of educators and parents of younger children do use the 
Internet.  
[TABLE 2 HERE]

----- Page 10 (native) -----
Table 2 shows that younger age groups can indeed be qualified as digital natives in terms of the 
prominence that ICTs and the Internet have in their lives. The youngest Internet users (second 
generation digital natives) lived in households with the widest variety of ICTs and they used the 
Internet as a first port of call for the widest range of activities in comparison to almost all other 
generations. They also multitasked significantly more and referred to the Internet more than 
others for information for school and work. For most indicators of digital nativeness there was a 
linear decline with age and a clear drop in the 44 to 54 or 55 to 64 age groups. 
 
[TABLE 3 HERE] 
Table 3 provides an overview of what different age groups used the Internet for. Not surprisingly 
the teenage group was least likely to manage their finances online or use e-government. Younger 
people, when they did use the Internet were also less likely to use the Internet for civic 
participation and this corresponds to what we know about offline behaviour. Younger people were 
more likely to use the Internet for entertainment, social networking and diary functions. In terms of 
the three activity types most closely related to learning young people were more likely to use the 
Internet for fact checking (definitions of words and checking facts) and training (looking for jobs, 
eLearning, online courses). For current affairs and interests the differences between age groups 
were not significant. The linear decline by age in relation to the types of activities people engage 
with was less clear then when we looked at other indicators of digital nativeness. Although 
entertainment and social networking activities dropped steeply for those who were neither first nor 
second generation digital natives (14 to 25 year olds), for other activities related to applications 
for which some economical capital is necessary (shopping, investment and travel) first generation 
digital natives (18-25 year olds) were, not surprisingly, more likely than second generation digital 
natives (14-17 year olds) to participate.

----- Page 11 (native) -----
Experience 
Experience was also an important variable in relation to “digital nativeness”. In general there was 
an increase in household media richness (r=.22; p<.01), the importance of the Internet (r=.29; 
p<.01), multitasking (r=.20; p<.01) and internet self-efficacy (r=.38; p<.01) with an increase of 
experience. Thus those who had experienced the Internet for longer periods of time were more 
digitally native. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the most recent users (less than 6 
months) of use showed higher levels of self-efficacy (51% good or excellent skills), media 
richness (av=2.78), and importance of the internet (av=2.10) than those who had used the 
internet for 6 months to one year (28% good or excellent skills; av= 2.59 media richness; av=1.99 
internet as first port of call). . The difference was especially large for self-efficacy. We could call 
this the ‘honeymoon’ period in which the new user tries everything out and feels like the world is 
at their feet, after a few months (half a year) their enthusiasm dies down and they realise that 
there are many things they cannot do.  
 
[TABLE 4 HERE] 
 
In contrast to what was found for generational groups (see Table 3), all differences between 
experience groups were significant (see Table 4). Almost always it was those with the most 
experience, that is having used the Internet for more than 5 years, who used the Internet most 
independent of the activity observed. There were a few exceptions, entertainment, which the 
most novice users undertook more than the intermediate users. Current affairs and interests and 
person to person networking also showed a slight dip for those who had used the Internet 
between 6 months and 1 year in comparison to those who had used it less than that. For many 
other activities, including the three learning related activities (i.e. fact checking, training and 
learning and current affairs and interests) use showed a large increase for those individuals who 
had used the Internet for more than 1 year.

----- Page 12 (native) -----
Breadth of use 
The sum of all the internet uses discussed in the previous sections can be called the breadth of 
use, and the higher the number different activities a person undertakes the more the internet is 
integrated into the person’s everyday life.  
 
The increase in digital nativeness was exponential in relation to breadth of use. Not only were 
those with a narrow use less likely to multitask (r=.40;p<.01),, they were also less likely to use the 
Internet as a first port of call (r=.45;p<.01), and had far lower levels of internet self-efficacy 
(r=.49;p<.01),. In addition, they had a smaller variety of ICTs in their households (r=.37; p<.01). 
 
To understand how this type of expertise, or embededness in the Internet, is related to specific 
uses of the internet we grouped the number of different activities a person undertook based on 
quintiles of internet users. That is, we constructed five almost equally sized groups of internet 
users with different levels of breadth of use. 
 
[TABLE 5 HERE] 
 
Similar to what we found for experience groups, all differences between breadth of use groups 
were significant (see Table 5).  There was a pattern in the order in which people began to use the 
Internet for different purposes. The most popular activities for people who only used the Internet 
for one or two things tended to be shopping and travel, then, as the range of use increased, 
Internet users were more likely to use the Internet for current / affairs, training, entertainment, 
person to person networking and fact checking.  Using the Internet for social networking, finance, 
and diary functions were activities that were more likely to be undertaken by those who use the 
Internet for 10-12 activities than by those who undertake less than 10 activities.

Generation, experience and breadth of use  
Thus, the descriptives do not give straight forward answers to the question of what determines 
digital nativeness: age, experience, and breadth of use all seem important. Only by looking at 
their independent effect can we sort out which factors really determine who shows the 
characteristics of a digital native. Below we examine the importance of these three variables 
alongside gender, whether or not there are children in the household and level of education, in 
explaining: 1) being surrounded by all kinds of different technologies; 2) using the Internet as a 
first port of call for information; 3) multi-tasking; 4) self-efficacy and 5) using the Internet for three 
types of learning activities that are the focus here (fact checking, training and learning and current 
affairs and interests).  
[TABLE 6 HERE] 
 
Generation, experience and breadth of use were all significantly and independently related to the 
media richness of the household (see Table 6a). Younger people, those who had used the 
Internet for longer and those who had integrated the Internet into a wider variety of activities had 
more different ICTs in the household. In addition, the presence of children in the household and 
high levels of educational achievement were strongly related to the variety of technologies one 
had access to at home. Breadth of use and the presence of children in the household had a 
larger relative impact (based on standardized coefficients) on the media richness of the 
household than the age of the person. 
 
Generation, experience and breadth of use were all important predictors of using the Internet as a 
first port of call as a benchmark for digital natives (see Table 6b). In contrast to the media 
richness of the household, children and the level of education were not significantly related to 
using the Internet as a first port of call. However, women were significantly less likely than men to 
use the Internet as the first port of call. The strongest predictor of using the internet as the first 
port of call was the breadth of a person’s Internet use. 
 
 
12

----- Page 14 (native) -----
[TABLE 7 HERE] 
 
Similar to what was shown for media richness and using the internet as a first port of call, 
generation, experience and breadth of use were also good predictors for digital nativeness  when 
multitasking was taken as the ultimate indicator of this type of person (see Table 7a). Similar to 
internet use as a first port of call, level of education and having children did not influence the 
extent to which a person multi-tasked. 
 
 The importance of self-efficacy in relation to positive learning outcomes has been clear in offline 
learning. Similarly, the extent to which people report that their ability to use the Internet is poor, 
fair, good or excellent is a good predictor of Internet use and positive attitudes towards using the 
Internet as a source for information (see also Eastin & LaRose, 2000). However, it is not clear 
whether Internet self-efficacy itself is best explained by generation, experience and / or breadth of 
use. Table 7b shows that generation, but also experience and breadth of use as well as level of 
education were important in relation to how confident people were in their own Internet skills.  
 
[TABLE 8 HERE] 
 
Different indicators predict the three types of learning activities (fact checking; training and 
learning and current affairs (see Table 8). For fact checking breadth of use was proportionately 
the most important variable, generation and level of education were also significant predictors. In 
other words those who used the Internet for more purposes, were younger and had a higher level 
of education were more likely to use the Internet for fact checking. Breadth of use was also very 
important for training and learning, in addition this type of Internet activity was more likely to be 
undertaken by those with more education, those who were younger, those who considered 
themselves more expert at using technologies and women. For current affairs breadth of use was 
again important, along with generation and gender. Men and older generations were more likely 
 
13

----- Page 15 (native) -----
to use the Internet to keep up with current affairs. Experience (years) with using the Internet was 
not significant for any of the learning activities nor was the presence of children in the household.  
Discussion  
In this paper we have examined the extent to which generation, experience in using the Internet 
and breadth of use are good indicators of whether someone is a digital native or not. For the 
purposes of this paper a digital native has been defined as someone who comes from a media 
rich household, who uses the Internet as a first port of call for information, multi-tasks using ICTs 
and uses the Internet to carry out a range of activities particularly those with a focus on learning.  
 
Contrary to the argument put forward by proponents of the digital native concept, generation 
alone does not adequately define if someone is a digital native or not. From the analysis above it 
is clear that there are a range of factors involved. It appears that younger people do have a 
greater range of ICTs in their household, tend to use the Internet as a first port of call, have 
higher levels of Internet self-efficacy, multi-task more, and use the Internet for fact checking and 
formal learning activities. Nevertheless, generation was not the only significant variable in 
explaining these activities: gender, education, experience and breadth of use also play a part. 
Indeed in all cases immersion in a digital environment (i.e. the breadth of activities that people 
carry out online) tends to be the most important variable in predicting if someone is a digital 
native in the way they interact with the technology.  
 
In some respects these findings do support the arguments put forward by Prensky and others. A 
larger proportion of young people use the Internet, they are more likely to come from media rich 
homes are more confident about their skills and are more likely to engage in online learning 
activities. What implications this has for young people’s brain structures remains an open 
question. Nevertheless,, what is very clear is that  it is not helpful to define digital natives and 
immigrants as two distinct, dichotomous generations. While there were differences in how 
generations engaged with the internet there were similarities across generations as well mainly 
 
14

----- Page 16 (native) -----
based on how much experience people have with using technologies. In addition, the findings 
presented here confirm that individuals’ Internet use lies along a continuum of engagement 
instead of being a dichotomous divide between users and non-users (see also Warschauer, 
2002; Van Dijk 2005).   
 
This conclusion supports other research that has demonstrated that there are significant 
differences within cohorts of young people in terms of their preferences, skills and use of new 
technologies (e.g. Kennedy, et al., 2008). As Facer and Furlong argue young people are not, a 
“homogeneous generation of digital children” (Facer and Furlong, 2001: 467).  This research 
adds to existing research by showing that a generational distinction between natives and 
immigrants, us and them, is not reflected in empirical data. Therefore, the distinction is not helpful 
and could even be harmful. For example, the inequalities in use and breadth of use within 
younger generations could be exacerbated as teachers assume a level of knowledge in school 
lessons which may not be accurate for all students (Facer and Furlong, 2001); and teachers and 
parents do not help young people in this area as they feel powerless in trying to support them in 
their uses of the Internet and other new technologies (Cheong, 2008; Helsper, 2008b).  
 
So if generation is not the only defining characteristic of a digital native what implications does 
this analysis have for education policy and practice? In terms of formal education there seem to 
be two key messages. Firstly, it seems that adults, specifically teachers can “speak the same 
language” as their students if they want to. Younger people are more likely to have a wider variety 
of ICTs at home, use the Internet as a first port of call for information, multitask and use the 
Internet first for school / work information but many adults do as well. Tables 1-3 suggest that the 
biggest drop off in these activities in terms of generation appears after the age of 55 – much later 
than supporters of the digital native concept would have us believe and older than many 
educators.

Of course, some supporters of the digital native or net generation concept would agree that older 
people can learn to use technologies. For, example Tapscott (1998) draws on the work of Piaget 
to explain that learning to use technology is an assimilative process for young people who have 
always experienced technology as a part of their everyday lives. However, for older people where 
new technologies have been introduced at some stage in their life time it is an accommodative 
(thus more difficult) process (Tapscott, 1998). Whether this is true or not  cannot be gleaned from 
our data, but the findings do suggest that older generations have accommodated ICTs to a great 
extent and in quite a few instances to the same level as younger people.  
 
Secondly, this data helps to add to the debate in terms of what or how we teach young people in 
schools. While it is important to understand what young people are using new technologies for in 
debates about future developments in pedagogy and curriculum; we cannot assume that just 
because young people do more of something it is always a good thing. For example, the analysis 
here supports the view that young people multitask more. However, we do not know if this is a 
positive or negative aspect of young people’s use of new technology. Multitasking may have a 
negative impact on learning due to cognitive overload (Hembrooke and Gay 2003). Similarly, 
while young people are more likely to use the Internet as a first port of call for information this 
does not mean they are in fact skilled in dealing with and critically assessing information 
(Livingstone, 2008). Finally, while not the focus of this paper, there may not be much demand 
from young people for school to change as technology may well play very different roles in a 
student’s lives in and out of school (Bennet et al., 2008).  
 
This data also has implications for supporting informal and family learning which are important 
policy areas in the UK (Becta, 2008). It could be argued that there are potential learning benefits 
in many online activities from playing collaborative games to chatting in a forum. However, while 
in general in the policy literature access and use of the Internet is a “good thing” there is very little 
debate about the kinds of learning activities we want people to carry out online or indeed if any 
activities are seen as more “beneficial” for learning than others. Other studies with a broader 
 
16

----- Page 18 (native) -----
focus on different digital cultures and home socialization in relation to technologies argue that the 
impact of home interaction with the Internet on formal education cannot and should not be 
ignored because they influence what young people are able and willing to learn in school 
(Helsper, 2009).  Questions that educators need to ask themselves are, for example,, are we only 
interested in supporting formal learning activities or are we satisfied if people just focus on playing 
online games further developing skills they acquired in informal contexts?  In some ways this 
analysis helps to address this question. The analysis has shown that immersion in the technology 
(ie. breadth of online activities) is an important factor (although not the only factor) in 
understanding whether people are confident in their ICT skills and whether they use the Internet 
for the three learning activities classified here. Thus, perhaps policy makers should be developing 
initiatives that encourage broad use of technologies as opposed to focusing on one or two narrow 
activities. We speculatively conclude that immersion in ICTs, or perhaps more accurately, the 
integration of ICTs in many aspects of a person’s life, is likely to lead to the uptake of digital 
learning opportunities and that Internet users are unlikely to ignore these learning activities if they 
otherwise use technologies in a broad fashion.  
 
In terms of family learning there are also some interesting implications. Having children in the 
household is a significant variable in the media richness of the household. Thus, it could be 
argued that older generations might acquire the technology because they think it will benefit their 
children (Van Rompaey, Roe, & Struys, 2002; Venkatesh & Vitalari, 1992). This obviously, has 
positive implications for learning. However, interestingly, based on the analysis here, the 
presence of children in the household does not influence parents’ use of the Internet for their own 
learning activities. Parents have an important role to play in supporting their own children’s use of 
technology and our research shows know that generational gaps are far from insurmountable. 
Nevertheless,  we still need to explore and better understand the link between children’s use of 
technology, technology in the home and family learning.

----- Page 19 (native) -----
Finally, our analysis has demonstrated the continuing importance of socio-demographic variables. 
Specifically, education, and gender. The stronger a person’s educational background the more 
likely they are to feel confident in their ICT skills and use the Internet for learning activities, 
specifically fact checking and training and learning. Our analysis has also shown that gender is 
important. It is important that these issues of social inclusion and exclusion are not ignored in 
these debates around the idea of the digital native (Cheong, 2008; Facer and Furlong, 2001; 
Helsper, 2008a)  
Conclusion 
Although young people do use the Internet more, our analysis does not support the view that 
there are unbridgeable differences between those who can be classified as digital natives or 
digital immigrants based on when they are born.  
 
This is important because the term digital native, net generation and other catchy terms are being 
used widely in public and political debate. The acceptance of these generalizations is especially 
problematic in a context where JISC, BECTA and academics are investing significantly in 
research programmes that aim to explore and better understand learners’ experiences of using 
technologies. More importantly, the frequent uncritical use of these and similar terms, even if the 
term is used without accepting the underlying assumptions, could have a negative impact upon 
the perceived possibilities of teacher- student interaction. 
 
Proponents of a generational definition of concepts such as that of the digital native arguably 
support a view of society as a new era that is fundamentally different and signals a break with 
previous times (Stevenson, 2002); where technology is a key driver of this change (Webster, 
2002). Yet what this data indicates is that the opposite is true – that contemporary society is a 
continuation of the past and technology, while important, is not the only determining factor in our 
lives. There can be a tendency within educational policy to see technology as the “fix” or 
“solution” to many of the challenges the sector faces (Robins and Webster, 1989) and there is a 
 
18

----- Page 20 (native) -----
danger that the current popularity of statements about young ‘techy’ generations could increase 
the prominence of this deterministic view. To counter such claims the publication and discussion 
of empirical work on the realities of how younger and older generations learn through and engage 
with technology is needed. This study and other research such as that by Facer and Furlong 
(2001), Bennet et al (2008) and Cheong, (2008) are steps in the right direction but further 
research and greater awareness amongst parents and practitioners is necessary. 
 
While survey data goes some way to understanding these issues, more qualitative work could 
also be beneficial to explore the dynamics of family learning, what people actually do when they 
are online, how learning can take place and the importance of cognitive and neurological 
development. Reporting of use of the Internet is not the same as understanding the learning that 
may take place as a result of this use. In particular, we lack studies that discuss household 
member and peer interactions, for example in relation to proxy use, as regards the use of and 
learning from ICTs. Such research is vital in order to refine and advance existing theories of 
learning using new technologies.  
 
Prensky, Oblinger and Oblinger and others are right - we need to understand learners in order to 
teach them well. We are not saying education should not change, but debates about change must 
be based on empirical evidence and not rhetoric.
