Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1.9 million deaths worldwide are attributable to physical inactivity and at least 2.6
million deaths are a result of being overweight or obese. In addition, WHO estimates that physical inactivity causes 10% to 16% of cases
each of breast cancer, colon, and rectal cancers as well as type 2 diabetes, and 22% of coronary heart disease and the burden of these and
other chronic diseases has rapidly increased in recent decades.
Objectives
The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence of the eﬀectiveness of school-based interventions in promoting
physical activity and fitness in children and adolescents.
Search methods
The search strategy included searching several databases to October 2011. In addition, reference lists of included articles and background
papers were reviewed for potentially relevant studies, as well as references from relevant Cochrane reviews. Primary authors of included
studies were contacted as needed for additional information.
Selection criteria
To be included, the intervention had to be relevant to public health practice (focused on health promotion activities), not conducted
by physicians, implemented, facilitated, or promoted by staﬀ in local public health units, implemented in a school setting and aimed
at increasing physical activity, included all school-attending children, and be implemented for a minimum of 12 weeks. In addition, the
review was limited to randomized controlled trials and those that reported on outcomes for children and adolescents (aged 6 to 18 years).
Primary outcomes included: rates of moderate to vigorous physical activity during the school day, time engaged in moderate to vigorous
physical activity during the school day, and time spent watching television. Secondary outcomes related to physical health status measures
including: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), and pulse
rate.
Data collection and analysis
Standardized tools were used by two independent reviewers to assess each study for relevance and for data extraction. In addition, each
study was assessed for risk of bias as specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Where discrepancies
existed, discussion occurred until consensus was reached. The results were summarized narratively due to wide variations in the
populations, interventions evaluated, and outcomes measured.

Main results
In the original review, 13,841 records were identified and screened, 302 studies were assessed for eligibility, and 26 studies were included
in the review. There was some evidence that school-based physical activity interventions had a positive impact on four of the nine outcome
measures. Specifically positive eﬀects were observed for duration of physical activity, television viewing, VO2 max, and blood cholesterol.
Generally, school-based interventions had little eﬀect on physical activity rates, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and pulse rate. At
a minimum, a combination of printed educational materials and changes to the school curriculum that promote physical activity resulted
in positive eﬀects.
In this update, given the addition of three new inclusion criteria (randomized design, all school-attending children invited to participate,
minimum 12-week intervention) 12 of the original 26 studies were excluded. In addition, studies published between July 2007 and October
2011 evaluating the eﬀectiveness of school-based physical interventions were identified and if relevant included. In total an additional
2378 titles were screened of which 285 unique studies were deemed potentially relevant. Of those 30 met all relevance criteria and have
been included in this update. This update includes 44 studies and represents complete data for 36,593 study participants. Duration of
interventions ranged from 12 weeks to six years.
Generally, the majority of studies included in this update, despite being randomized controlled trials, are, at a minimum, at moderate risk
of bias. The results therefore must be interpreted with caution. Few changes in outcomes were observed in this update with the exception
of blood cholesterol and physical activity rates. For example blood cholesterol was no longer positively impacted upon by school-based
physical activity interventions. However, there was some evidence to suggest that school-based physical activity interventions led to an
improvement in the proportion of children who engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity during school hours (odds ratio (OR)
2.74, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.01 to 3.75). Improvements in physical activity rates were not observed in the original review. Children
and adolescents exposed to the intervention also spent more time engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity (with results across
studies ranging from five to 45 min more), spent less time watching television (results range from five to 60 min less per day), and had
improved VO2max (results across studies ranged from 1.6 to 3.7 mL/kg per min). However, the overall conclusions of this update do not
diﬀer significantly from those reported in the original review.
Authors' conclusions
The evidence suggests the ongoing implementation of school-based physical activity interventions at this time, given the positive eﬀects
on behavior and one physical health status measure. However, given these studies are at a minimum of moderate risk of bias, and the
magnitude of eﬀect is generally small, these results should be interpreted cautiously. Additional research on the long-term impact of these
interventions is needed.

School-based physical activity programs for promoting physical activity and fitness in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18
It is estimated that as many at 1.9 million deaths worldwide are attributable to physical inactivity, and that inactivity is a key risk factor
in the development of most chronic diseases and cancers. This is alarming particularly because it is known that physical activity patterns
track from childhood into adulthood.
There is some evidence to suggest that school-based physical activity interventions are eﬀective in increasing the number of children
engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity, as well as how long they spend engaged in these activities. There is also evidence to
suggest that these interventions reduce the amount of time spent watching television.
This review included 44 studies that evaluated the impact of school-based interventions focused on increasing physical activity among
36,593 children and adolescents. Participants were between the ages of six and 18 living in Australia, South America, Europe, China, and
North America. Duration of interventions ranged from 12 weeks to six years. No two school-based physical activity promotion programs
had the same combination of interventions. Furthermore, the duration, frequency, and intensity of interventions varied greatly across
studies. Data collection methods for outcomes were reported to be valid and reliable in a little over half of the included studies.
There is some evidence that school-based physical activity interventions are eﬀective in increasing duration of physical activity from five
to 45 min more per day, reducing time spent watching television from five to 60 min less per day, and increasing maximal oxygen uptake
or aerobic capacity, reflecting physical fitness level of an individual. The evidence also suggests that children exposed to school-based
physical activity interventions are approximately three times more likely to engage in moderate to vigorous physical activity during the
school day than those not exposed. At a minimum, a combination of printed educational materials and changes to the school curriculum
that promote physical activity during school hours result in positive eﬀects for these outcomes. School-based interventions are not
eﬀective in increasing physical activity rates among adolescents, or in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood cholesterol,
body mass index, and pulse rate.

Description of the condition
International public health and health promotion organizations
have identified the health risks across the lifespan associated with
physical inactivity. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates
that 1.9 million deaths throughout the world are attributable to
physical inactivity and at least 2.6 million deaths are a result
of being overweight or obese (WHO 2004a). Globally, physical
inactivity is estimated to cause 10% to 16% of cases each of breast
cancer, colon, and rectal cancers as well as type 2 diabetes, and
22% of coronary heart disease and the burden of these and other
chronic diseases has rapidly increased in recent decades (WHO
2004a). In addition, the literature indicates that an elevated body
mass index (BMI) places children and adolescents at greater risk
for cardiovascular disease (CVD) as adults (Haque 2008; USDHHS
2008), and that diet and physical activity are important factors
in maintaining a healthy BMI range (Elgar 2005). Recognizing the
unique opportunity that exists to formulate and implement an
eﬀective strategy to reduce deaths and disease burden worldwide
substantially by improving diet and promoting physical activity,
WHO adopted, in May 2004, the "Global Strategy on Diet, Physical
Activity and Health". Since its adoption, WHO has been working
with stakeholders providing technical assistance and support to
facilitate implementation of this global strategy.
The promotion of physical activity is an essential public health
and health promotion strategy to improve the health of individuals
and populations (WHO 2004a). In fact several systematic reviews
have been published highlighting the benefits of physical activity
among healthy children (Armstrong 1994; Brown 2009; CDC 1997;
CDC 1999; McMurray 2002; Thakor 2004; Tolfrey 2000; Whitt-Glover
2009 ; Zahner 2006). To ensure sustained progress toward major
improvements in chronic disease prevention, the WHO called on
public health organizations within and between countries to work
collaboratively with key partners, including educators and health
professional bodies, educational institutions, consumer groups,
the research community, and the private sector, in providing
a comprehensive strategy to promote physical activity among
children and adolescents (WHO 2004a). The WHO specifically
identified schools as a target setting for the promotion of physical
activity among children and youth. To this end, activities include
the provision of collaboration on the development of health-
related curricula; educational policy and guideline development;
professional development opportunities for educators and other
partners; and, research, evaluation, and knowledge exchange
to facilitate the development of evidence-informed policies,
programs, and practices.
This systematic review was first published in 2009. Since that time,
several new trials have been published and have been included
in this update. While addition of these new studies contributed
further to the evidence-base, they did not substantively alter
the findings of the original review or change recommendations
made for promoting physical activity and fitness in children and
adolescents within the school system. The purpose of this update
is to synthesize new data on the eﬀectiveness of school-based
physical activity interventions with data included in the original
review. This update includes evaluations of published studies
indexed up to and including 21 October 2011. While evidence exists
documenting the benefits of physical activity for healthy children,
at the time the original review was conducted, no other reviews had
systematically examined the eﬀectiveness of various combinations
of school-based interventions in promoting physical activity and
fitness in children. In addition, since one of the goals of the public
health system is to reduce obesity-related mortality and morbidity
(OMoH 1997; WHO 2008), it is important to identity and then
implement eﬀective strategies to address obesity and overweight
among children.
Magnitude of the problem
Physical inactivity is one of the leading causes of the major chronic
diseases, and largely contributes to the burden of disease, death,
and disability in developing and developed countries (WHO 2004a).
Elimination of modifiable risk factors including an unhealthy
diet, tobacco use, and physical inactivity would prevent 80% of
premature heart disease, 80% of premature stroke, 80% of type
2 diabetes, and 40% of cancer (WHO 2008). Physical inactivity
has been identified as a serious problem and major public health
concern for people of all ages (Health Canada 2007; USDHHS 2008).
In fact, physical activity was labeled as "today's best buy in public
health" almost two decades ago (Morris 1994) with a suggestion
that significant savings in health care could result from a mere
10% increase in physical activity population wide (CFLRI 1997;
Katzmarzyk 2000; Katzmarzyk 2004). Despite these assertions,
physical inactivity rates have risen rather than decreased in
the past two decades. In addition to significant savings, being
physically active is stated to be one of the most important steps
people can take to improve their health (USDHHS 2008). Yet,
according to the latest international Health Behaviour in School-
aged Children (HBSC) study, less than two-thirds of all young
people report participating in suﬀicient physical activity to meet
current guidelines (CDC 2008; WHO 2004b). Previous reports have
concluded that the intensity, frequency, and duration of physical
activity contribute to overall physical health status and suggest
that a 'threshold' must be maintained in order to produce positive
health eﬀects (CDC 1997; CDC 1999; McMurray 2002; Pate 1994;
Shephard 1997; Thakor 2004; Tolfrey 2000; Zahner 2006). In fact,
a positive linear association between duration of physical activity
and positive health eﬀects has been established, with longer
duration associated with increased physical health (Pate 1994;
Shephard 1997). Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) is a standard
measure associated with fitness levels, with increasing values
expected as fitness level improves, and is an important indicator
of successful physical activity interventions. Current guidelines
suggest that children and adolescents should engage in 60 min
or more of active play per day (Janssen 2010; USDHHS 2008;
WHO 2004b) and that the majority of this time should be spent
engaged in aerobic activity. The guidelines also recommend that
adolescents should engage in three or more sessions per week of
activities that last 20 min or more at a time, that require moderate
to vigorous levels of exertion.
Examples of moderate to vigorous activities include brisk walking,
jogging, stair climbing, basketball, racquet sports, soccer, dance,
swimming laps, skating, strength training, lawn mowing, strenuous
housework, cross-country skiing, and cycling. Research suggests
that the best primary strategy for improving the long-term health
of children and adolescents through exercise may be creating a
lifestyle pattern of regular physical activity that will carry over to the
adult years (Freedson 1992; Telama 2005; Twisk 2000). Longitudinal
data have shown that for each weekday that normal weight
adolescents participated in physical education (PE), the odds of

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
becoming overweight in adulthood decreased by 5% (Menschik
2008). It is therefore of primary importance to identify approaches
that will be eﬀective in increasing and sustaining activity levels of
children and adolescents during school hours.
International surveys of physical activity (Cale 1992; CFLRI 1997;
CFLRI 2007; Kannas 1992; Marella 1992; WHO 2004b) highlight
the epidemic of physical inactivity among children. Despite
many methodological diﬀerences, these surveys have consistently
reported that fewer than 50% of boys and girls are active enough to
produce health benefits, that a considerably smaller proportion of
girls than boys are suﬀiciently active, and that activity participation
declines with age during adolescence (Adams 1995; CDC 1997; CDC
1999; CDC 2008; WHO 2004b). However, it is not clear at what age
the decline begins, if the rate of decline is linear (Sallis 2000; Stone
1998), and if the decline is greater in girls than boys (Story 2009 ;
WHO 2004b).
These data are alarming for several reasons: a) changes in risk-
related behaviors (e.g. increasing physical activity) may modify
risk factors for chronic diseases such as hypertension or raised
blood lipids among children (Arbeit 1992; Ball 2003; Gutin 1997;
Hagberg 1983; Hansen 1991; Harrell 1996; Killen 1989; Walter 1988);
b) physical activity aﬀects physical and psychosocial health as
physically active adolescents had lower prevalence of anxiety and
depression (Summerbell 2005); c) physical activity patterns track
from childhood into adulthood (CDC 2008; Dennison 1988; Kelder
1994; Klepp 1993; Malina 1996; Malina 2001; Raitakari 1994; Sallis
1992; Summerbell 2005); d) children are increasingly exhibiting
risk factors for CVD, such as obesity (Hill 1998; Katz 2009; Moran
1999; Troiano 1995; Warden 1997), elevated blood lipids (Lee 1986),
and hypertension (Fernandes 2000; Katz 2009), conditions that are
known to track into adulthood (Gonzalez-Suarez 2009; Kemper
1990; Lauer 1989; Mahoney 1991; Nicklas 1995; Porkka 1991; Power
1997; Shear 1986; Webber 1983; Webber 1991; Whitaker 1997); and
d) atherosclerotic fatty streaks in the coronary arteries, indicative of
coronary heart disease, have been found in overweight adolescents
(Haque 2008), and postmortem in children (Berenson 1992).
Determinants of physical activity among children
Increasing physical activity among children and adolescents is
diﬀicult as behavior is influenced by several factors including:
personal factors; institutional, community, and public policy; and
the physical environment (CIHR 2004). Lindquist 1999, basing their
work on Kohl 1998, provided a typology for understanding the
multitude of factors that may influence children's physical activity
patterns. This classification considers determinants at four levels:
physiological, psychological, sociocultural, and ecological.
Physiological determinants of physical activity among children
and adolescents include age, gender, and ethnicity (Hudson 2008;
Lindquist 1999; Pate 1994; Reynolds 1990; Sallis 1993; Sallis 2000).
Specifically, girls have been found to be less active than boys,
older children and adolescents less active than younger children,
and black girls less active than white girls (Adams 1995; CDC
1997; Kelder 1995b; Ogden 2006; Robinson 1995; Zakarian 1994).
Psychological determinants of physical activity include confidence
in one's ability to engage in exercise (self eﬀicacy) (Dishman 2004),
perception of physical or sport competence (Sallis 2000), having a
positive attitude toward physical activity (Trost 1997), enjoyment
of physical activity (Dishman 2005), and perceiving benefits from
engaging in physical activity (Ferguson 1989; Tappe 1990; Zakarian
1994). Conversely, perceived barriers to physical activity, such
as lack of time or feeling tired, are negatively associated with
physical activity among adolescents (Tappe 1990; Zakarian 1994).
Sociocultural influences include support for and participation in
physical activity of peers and siblings (Sallis 1988), parental level of
physical activity (Adkins 2004; Andersen 1992; Biddle 1992; Butcher
1985; Freedson 1992; Garcia 1995; McMurray 1993; Moore 1991;
Poest 1989; Reynolds 1990; Sallis 1988; Sallis 1992; Stucky-Ropp
1993; Zakarian 1994), parental support (Sallis 2000), and parental
income. Ecological determinants of physical activity include access
to play spaces, facilities, availability of equipment (Stucky-Ropp
1993), and transportation to activities or programs (Sallis 1992).
In addition, time spent outdoors in the early years is positively
correlated with physical activity levels among children (Sallis 1993).
Description of the intervention
The school setting is an ideal environment for population-based
physical activity interventions as no other institution has as
much influence on children during their first two decades of life
(Story 2009). Physical activity in schools has also been shown
to be indirectly associated with academic achievement including
lower drop-out rates, better classroom behavior, self-esteem and
engagement in school, and on-task behavior (Mahar 2006; Trudeau
2008). While the schools alone cannot solve the problem of
inactivity, they do have the potential to become the central
element in a community that ensures students participate in
the recommended amount of time engaged in physical activity
(Koplan 2005; Pate 2006).   Schools provide benefit to children
from all risk groups (Harrell 1996; WHO 2004a), particularly those
with limited or no access to play areas (McKenzie 1996); and
avoids stigmatization of at-risk children (Harrell 1998). Leading
organizations recommend that schools implement policies that
require daily PE; elementary school recess; and physical activity
before, during, and afer school (Pate 2006). However, it is not clear
what the most eﬀective strategies are to promote life-long healthy
behaviors.
Worrisome trends in the school setting are occurring concurrently
with the increasing prevalence of obesity including a decline in
physically active transport to and from school, recess duration, and
enrolment in PE classes (Pate 2006). Although most schools require
PE as part of their curriculum, PE classes may occur infrequently
and children are ofen relatively inactive in them (McKenzie 1995;
Pate 2006; Simons-Morton 1990; Simons-Morton 1994). Increasing
the frequency and duration of PE is not always feasible given
competing curriculum demands. It is thus essential to promote
physical activity throughout the school day during classes, lunch
times, and recess, and to develop strategies to promote more
eﬀicient use of PE class time.
The studies included in the original review and now in this
update, all implemented diﬀerent combinations of physical activity
promotion interventions in schools, with some also implementing
interventions concurrently in the community as well as in the
home. Generally the interventions focused on providing students
with information about the benefits of physical activity and healthy
nutrition, the risks associated with inactivity and unhealthy food
choices, and increasing the amount of time students were engaged
in physical activity during the school day, as well as ensuring
they expended greater amounts of energy during physical activity
sessions. The interventions targeted school curriculum (related to
PE classes specifically and whole curriculum generally), teacher

ways to promote physical activity and to incorporate it into
curricula); training materials including kits, packages of materials
to be used in curricula, and materials to be given to students
and parents. Packages included teaching notes on exercise, how
the body works, healthy eating and nutrition. They also targeted
PE classes by increasing the level of activity students engaged in
during these classes, introduced activities geared to the age and
level of development of the child, and put greater emphasis on
games. Students were also encouraged to be more active outside
of school during leisure time. The curriculum focused on creating a
positive self-image through awareness of physical activity benefits.
Curriculum changes were also implemented in other courses, such
as science, where discussions of healthy eating and physical activity
were incorporated. Some interventions also included changes to
the food provided in school cafeterias so as to increase the number
of healthy food choices. Other strategies included a risk factor
assessment of students to identify students with established risk
factors and develop a plan to reduce their risk through increased
physical activity, healthy nutrition, and goal attainment.
Adverse eﬀects of the intervention
There are a number of advantages to school-based physical
activity promotion strategies. For example, school-based strategies
targeting all students through curriculum, ensures 100% of
students are exposed to the intervention, thereby increasing
the reach of these interventions. In addition, targeting the
interventions at all students in a school could avoid stigmatizing
children who are overweight, obese, or with established risk
factors for chronic diseases. Stigmatization of children and
adolescents has been shown to have a negative impact on self
esteem, self worth, and mental health. Therefore interventions
directed at entire school populations could eﬀectively avoid these
negative impacts. However, it is also likely that stigmatization
will not be avoided, particularly when unfit students must engage
in rigorous physical activity in front of their peers. In fact
the more rigorous the activity, the greater the likelihood that
certain students will be identified as being particularly unfit by
their peers, and potentially subjected to ridicule. In addition,
having to change clothes to engage in physical activity may be
particularly stressful for overweight and obese students and it
is diﬀicult to identify strategies to reduce issues associated with
changing clothes that would not further stigmatize these students.
Another potential adverse eﬀect of school-based physical activity
promotion interventions arises from 'forcing' students to engage in
rigorous activity when they do not want to. Instead of promoting
positive perceptions of exercise this intervention could produce the
opposite eﬀect resulting in students not wanting to engage in any
activity, and having very negative perceptions. This may result in
worse outcomes with respect to activity levels. Furthermore, being
made to engage in certain behavior may result in reactance, which
means students will do the exact opposite. In both instances it is
possible that an even further reduction in physical activity levels
could occur. Another adverse eﬀect of school-based interventions
related to the development of a reward system, such as a grade,
is the loss of the intrinsic motivation to engage in an activity
that was previously viewed as fun. In other words students might
become unmotivated to engage in physical activity because they
now perceive it to be 'work', or they require larger and larger
rewards for doing a behavior they previously engaged in for no
reward. Finally, it is possible that sof tissue injuries might occur
among students associated with the increased rigorous physical
activity.
How the intervention might work
Given school-aged children spend a significant amount of their
wakeful hours either in transit to or in the school setting,
and that in many countries, all children attend school until
they reach adolescence, school-based physical activity promotion
interventions have potential to reduce population-wide chronic
diseases. School-based interventions can target simultaneously,
children both at risk and not at risk for future chronic diseases,
and can increase both knowledge and behavior conducive to
healthier lifestyles. The intent of school-based physical activity
interventions is to increase the overall percentage of children and
adolescents engaged in physical activity each day and to increase
the duration of moderate to vigorous activity engaged in on a
weekly basis. The aim is to create a school environment that
is more conducive to achieving higher rates of physical activity
among children and adolescents as well as increasing the time
spent engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity. Generally
this means significant changes to school curriculum that support
increased time for physical activity as well as increased levels
of activity during this time. There is an important opportunity
through school-based interventions to ensure greater attention to
improving knowledge of chronic disease prevention and health
promotion, and by providing students with both knowledge and the
opportunity to be more active during the school day, children will
develop healthier behaviors that may track in adulthood.
Why it is important to do this review
A number of reviews have been conducted on similar topics. For
example, Summerbell 2005 explored the impact of interventions
to prevent obesity in children, and Thomas 2004a assessed the
impact of strategies to promote healthy body weight in children
and adolescents. Both reviews are of rigorous methodological
quality and provide important direction for healthy body weight
promotion policies and programs. What is diﬀicult to ascertain from
these reviews is the specific impact of school-based strategies on
healthy body weight, as well as the specific role of physical activity
in reducing risk factors associated with chronic diseases. In both
the Summerbell 2005 and Thomas 2004a reviews, interventions
were multifaceted, meaning the interventions targeted multiple
behaviors including diet and physical activity simultaneously, and
that they were implemented congruently in multiple settings such
as the community, schools, and public places. In both reviews it
is unclear what specific contribution the school setting had on
intervention eﬀectiveness as well as the individual contribution
of physical activity on improved health status measures, such as
blood pressure, blood lipids, weight, and fitness measures.
However, given school-aged children spend such a significant
amount of time in the school setting, and that many barriers
exist to participation in physical activity outside of the school
setting (e.g. resources, availability), it is particularly important
to understand the extent to which school-based physical activity
promotion interventions are eﬀective in increasing activity and
fitness levels. When school-based interventions are combined with
broader community-based interventions, it is diﬀicult to ascertain
the impact of school-based strategies. However, in developing

comprehensive physical activity or chronic disease prevention
strategies, it is crucial to incorporate eﬀective school-based
strategies. Therefore, it is timely, given the worldwide attention to
physical inactivity, that a review focused solely on the eﬀectiveness
of school-based physical activity interventions be conducted and
regularly updated.
O B J E C T I V E S
The purpose of this systematic review was to assess, analyze,
and draw conclusions about the eﬀectiveness of school-based
interventions in promoting physical activity and fitness in school-
attending children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. The specific
objectives were:
•
to evaluate the eﬀects of school-based interventions on
promoting physical activity and fitness in children and
adolescents;
•
to evaluate the eﬀects of school-based interventions on
improving measures of physical health status;
•
to determine if certain combinations or components (or both)
of school-based interventions are more eﬀective than others in
promoting physical activity and fitness in this target population.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
In the original review and this update the following criteria were
used to select studies. The intervention had to be relevant to public
health practice (meaning the focus was on health promotion from
an individual or population-wide perspective, was not physician
or clinic based); b) the intervention could be implemented,
facilitated, or promoted by staﬀ in local public health units,
meaning interventions that were only relevant to other health
professionals (e.g. physicians), or fitness experts (e.g. personal
trainers) were not considered 'regular' practice for public health
professionals; c) the intervention was implemented in a school
setting and was aimed at increasing physical activity and fitness in
children and adolescents.
Furthermore, in this update we included data only from
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum intervention
duration of 12 weeks.
Three unique changes were made to the protocol of this update in
comparison to the original review.
1. Due to the availability of numerous RCTs, both those included
in the original review and those that became available afer
the original review was published in The Cochrane Library,
the inclusion/exclusion criteria were modified to include only
those studies that were RCTs. This change in inclusion criterion
resulted in a number of non-RCTs included in the original review
being excluded from the update.
2. Studies had to have at a minimum an intervention duration of at
least 12 weeks otherwise they were excluded from the update.
Again this resulted is some studies included in the original
review being excluded from the update.
3. Studies not aimed at the general population (e.g. studies
including obese children only, or only low-active children) were
excluded from this update. Again this resulted in a small number
of studies included in the original review being excluded in the
update.
The review authors are aware that post hoc questions are
susceptible to bias (Higgins 2011); however, in light of the growing
body of literature on the eﬀectiveness of school-based physical
activity promotion interventions, we believe the changes in
inclusion and exclusion criteria were necessary to ensure the most
rigorous evidence answering our research question was included in
this update.
Types of participants
Studies that included school-attending children and adolescents
between the ages of 6 to 18 years were included in this review. This
included all otherwise healthy children and adolescents whether
they were overweight, obese, or not. We excluded studies where
participants received a physical activity intervention as part of a
treatment regimen for a specific critical illness or comorbidity (e.g.
diabetes).
Types of interventions
Strategies
Any study that assessed educational, health promotion,
counseling, and management strategies focused on the promotion
of physical activity and fitness, that were or could be provided by
public health professionals was included in this review.
Interventions included
The range of interventions included changes to school curriculum;
changes in school routines to increase time spent by students
being physically active; increase in the time students engaged
in vigorous physical activity during PE classes; provision of
equipment; training for teachers in incorporating physical activity
into school curriculum and routines; and educational materials for
teachers, students, and parents. In some instances the intervention
included strategies to engage parents in the intervention, as
well as community-based strategies, mass media, and policy
development.
Setting
Studies where the interventions were targeted primarily within
the school setting were included in this review. In some instances
interventions were also implemented in the community and home
setting in addition to the school-based interventions, although the
primary focus had to be the school setting. We excluded studies
when the intervention was conducted entirely outside of the school
setting (e.g. community setting, public place, recreation facility,
physician oﬀice, camp setting).
Types of comparisons
Generally, these programs were compared to standard, currently
existing PE programs in schools.
Intervention personnel
The interventions were implemented by a variety of professionals
including PE teachers, classroom teachers, research staﬀ, health
professionals, peers and in a few studies parents.

Indicators of theory and process
In a number of studies the development of the intervention was
guided by one or more theories such as the health-belief model,
social-cognitive theory, stages of change, or a combination. Where
theory informed the development of the intervention this was
noted.
Interventions excluded
Interventions excluded from this review included those that were
not focused on changing physical activity and fitness levels or were
not implemented primarily in the school setting among healthy
children aged 6 to 18 years or were implemented by physicians, or
fitness experts.
Types of outcome measures
To be included, studies had to report one or more of the
following outcomes, presenting a baseline and a post intervention
measurement. These data were used to evaluate change from
baseline if not reported in the study.
Primary outcomes
•
Rate of  moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (per cent
of sample engaged in MVPA). The rate of  MVPA was assessed
either through self-report or through the use of accelerometers
during both school or non-school (or both) time. The rate
was calculated by dividing the number of students engaged in
MVPA by the total number of students allocated to either the
intervention or control group.
•
Duration of physical activity (time spent engaged in MVPA).
Duration of physical activity was measured as the total minutes
per hour or week spent engaged in MVPA generally through
self-report, although some studies collected these data via
accelerometers.
•
Television viewing (time spent watching TV). Television viewing
was measured by self-report or parental report as the minutes
per hour or week spent watching television, outside of school.
Secondary outcomes
•
Mean systolic blood pressure (mmHg). This outcome
was 
measured 
either 
manually 
using 
a 
mercury
sphygmomanometer or via a Dinamap machine. The timing of
when blood pressure was measured diﬀered significantly across
studies with timing varying between 5 and 15 min following
active periods during school hours.   Additionally, in some
studies the average of three measures taken one minute apart
were used, in others five measures were averaged, and in others
the second and third of three measures were averaged.
•
Mean diastolic blood pressure (mmHg). This outcome was
measured in the same way as systolic blood pressure.
•
Mean blood cholesterol (mg/dL). Blood samples were taken for
some studies afer fasting, and for others with no fasting. Blood
samples were taken by health professionals trained to follow a
given protocol and sent for processing.
•
BMI (kg/m2). This outcome was measured by trained health
professionals using calibrated scales. However, diﬀerences
existed across studies in which clothes were worn by
participants during measurement; and when height and weight
were measured during school time.
•
Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) (mL/kg/minute).
This outcome was measured in diﬀerent ways by trained
professionals. In some instances pulse rate recovery was used
as a proxy for VO2max and in other instances actual maximal
oxygen uptake was measured.
•
Pulse rate (beats/minute). This outcome was measured by
trained professionals during school time, during seated rest. It
was usually taken at the same time as blood pressure.
Timing of outcome measurement
Outcomes were primarily measured at baseline and immediately
post intervention. In a small subset of studies outcomes were
measured six months, nine months, 12 months, and, in one study,
up to four years post intervention.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
The search strategy, was developed to be inclusive and rigorous
(Higgins 2011) and consistent with The Cochrane Collaboration
methodology for conducting a comprehensive search of the
literature.
For the original review the following databases were searched
from 1985 to July 2007: MEDLINE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, EMBASE,
SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). For the updated
review, the same databases were searched again to capture studies
published between July 2007 to October 2011. Search strategies for
each database are included in Appendix 1. Additional key words
of relevance were detected during initial electronic searches. The
search strategies were then modified to incorporate these terms.
The MEDLINE search strategy was adapted for use in the above
databases. Studies were not excluded on the basis of language. For
an overview of the search process see Figure 1.

Searching other resources
Contacting experts
Experts in the field of physical activity promotion in children and
adolescents were contacted with a view to seeking additional
references.
Reference lists checked
We identified additional studies by searching the reference lists
of included studies and (systematic) reviews, meta-analyses, and
health technology assessment reports.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
The review team was composed of a health services researcher
(MD), a project coordinator (KD), program manager (HH), and
research assistants (DT, PR, for the original review and RL, for
this update) from an academic research center. Where multiple
publications for the same study existed, a project account was
created and relevant data extracted from all articles.
The abstracts from all search strategies were imported into
Reference Manager and screened independently by RL, HH, and KD.
Project accounts (studies) judged as being potentially relevant were
retrieved in their entirety and assessed for relevance independently
by two review authors (MD, RL) using a standardized tool. Where
disagreement occurred, discussion ensued until consensus was
achieved. Selection criteria for the original review included: a)
an intervention relevant to public health practice was described
(meaning the focus was on health promotion from an individual
or population-wide perspective, was not physician or clinic based);
b) the intervention could be implemented, facilitated, or promoted
by staﬀ in local public health units, meaning interventions that
were only relevant to other health professionals (e.g. physicians), or
fitness experts (e.g. personal trainers) were not considered 'regular'
practice for public health professionals; c) the intervention was
implemented in a school setting and was aimed at increasing
physical activity and fitness in children and adolescents; d)
outcomes were reported for children and adolescents (aged 6 to
18 years); and e) the study design was prospective and included
a control group. New selection criteria were added for the update
including: f) the study was an RCT; g) the intervention was targeted
at all school children; and h) the intervention was implemented

for 12 or more weeks. All criteria had to be met for a study to be
included in the review. Those studies that were deemed relevant
were then assessed for risk of bias. An adapted PRISMA (preferred
reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) flow-
chart of study selection is attached (Figure 1) (Liberati 2009).
Data extraction and management
For this update three review authors (MD, RL, KD) independently
abstracted relevant population and intervention characteristics
for all new studies using standard data extraction templates (see
Characteristics of included studies, Table 1, Appendix 3, and
Appendix 4). All disagreements were resolved by discussion. Any
relevant missing information was sought from the primary author
of the study. Data from all new studies were extracted using the
same data extraction tool as used in the original review (Thomas
2004b). Extracted data included year and country of study, research
design, sample, intervention (descriptors, theoretical framework,
provider, setting, target group, target group size, consumer
involvement), intervention duration and intensity, length of follow-
up, and outcome data.
Dealing with duplicate publications
Where multiple publications for the same study existed, a project
account was created and relevant data extracted from all articles.
The article containing the most complete data on the project was
identified as the primary article for a project account. All other
related articles were identified as companion articles for a project
account. All primary and companion article groupings are available
in the section Included studies. The final data collection point for
each outcome in each study has been used to assess intervention
eﬀectiveness.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
In the original review the methodological rigor of included studies
was assessed using a previously developed and tested quality
assessment tool (Thomas 2004b). For the update all studies from
the original review as well as studies identified for this update
were assessed independently for risk of bias by two of three review
authors (MD, RL, KD). MD assessed all studies for risk of bias while
RL and KD each conducted risk of bias on approximately half of
the studies. Critical assessments were made separately for each
of seven domains with judgments of low risk of bias, high risk of
bias, and unclear risk of bias (Higgins 2011). The following domains
were assessed: sequence generation, allocation concealment,
blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting,
and two 'other issues': control of confounders, and data collection
methods, which were two criteria used in the original review to
assess methodological quality (Thomas 2004b). Disagreements
were resolved through discussion until consensus was reached.
We assessed if the allocation sequence was adequately generated
and likely to produce comparable groups.  If the investigators
utilized and described a random component in the sequence
generation process we a
ssigned a judgment of low risk of bias. If there was no description of
allocation sequence given beyond a statement claiming to allocate
participants randomly, a rating of unclear risk of bias was given.
We also assessed whether the allocation sequence was adequately
concealed prior to and during recruitment. If the investigators
utilized and described an adequate process for concealing the
allocation sequence we assigned a judgment of low risk of bias.
  If the process was not adequate a rating of high risk of bias was
assigned. If there was no description of the process of allocation
concealment a rating of unclear risk of bias was given.
For blinding, we assessed whether any steps were taken to blind
participants, intervention providers, and outcome assessors to
which group participants were allocated. If adequate blinding
occurred a rating of low risk of bias was given. If blinding was not
adequate, we assigned a judgment of high risk of bias, and if it was
not described, a judgment of unclear risk of bias.
We assessed whether incomplete data were adequately
addressed.  Where studies did not report intention-to-treat (ITT)
analysis, review authors assessed how data related to attrition and
exclusions were reported and whether the data were comparable
to the total randomized number. A judgment of low risk of bias
was given when incomplete data were addressed adequately. A
judgment of high risk of bias was given when incomplete data were
not addressed adequately and unclear risk of bias if incomplete
data were not addressed.
For selective outcome reporting, we assessed whether reports of
the study were free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting.
Where all outcomes identified a priori were reported upon a rating
of low risk of bias was given. When prespecified outcomes were
not reported or outcomes were not prespecified and given no
justification, a rating of high risk of bias was given. If there was
insuﬀicient information to permit judgment, we assigned a rating
of unclear risk of bias.
We assessed the extent to which potential confounders were
assessed in the primary studies and whether diﬀerences at baseline
in these variables across groups were accounted for in the
analysis.  Studies that assessed all important confounders and
accounted for diﬀerences at baseline (if relevant) were given a
rating of low risk of bias. Those that did not assess for and take
into account all relevant confounders and those that either did not
assess most relevant confounders or did not account for diﬀerences
at baseline in the analysis (or both) were given a rating of high
risk of bias. Where there was not enough information to assess this
criteria, we assigned a rating of unclear risk of bias.
The reliability and validity of all data collection measures were also
assessed and data extracted only for those outcomes for which
some degree of reliability and validity was demonstrated. However,
in this literature the degree to which validity was established in
the most rigorous sense, for self-reported physical activity levels
was limited to construct or face validity. The majority of studies
measured physical activity rates through self-report. Therefore, this
criterion was not overly helpful in discriminating studies of lower
risk of bias.
Although in the original review, studies judged as having significant
limitations were removed, none of the new studies identified for
this update were removed from further analysis as a result of being
judged to have a high risk of bias. 
Measures of treatment eﬀect
No recalculations were performed. Unless otherwise stated, all data
are presented in the format mean and standard deviation (SD) with

95% confidence intervals (CI), where provided. Results with P > 0.05
are reported as not significant (NS).
Unit of analysis issues
Generally the unit of analysis was either classes or schools
depending on how groups were allocated to intervention and
control groups. Attention was paid to the extent to which the
appropriate unit of analysis was used in data analysis. However, in
some studies individuals were randomly allocated to intervention
and control groups and this was noted as needed in the risk of bias
assessment.
Dealing with missing data
Relevant missing data were sought from the primary authors.
Evaluation of important numerical data such as screened, eligible,
and randomized participants as well as ITT and per-protocol (PP)
populations was conducted. Attrition rates, for example drop-outs,
losses to follow-up, and withdrawals, were investigated.
Assessment of heterogeneity
Variation in the interventions, populations, and outcomes
measured made it inappropriate to combine the results statistically
across studies, therefore the results are synthesized narratively. For
example, the populations studied varied greatly in socioeconomic
status, ethnicity, and country. No two school-based physical
activity promotion programs had the same combination of
interventions. Furthermore, the duration, frequency, and intensity
of interventions varied greatly across studies. Finally, the outcomes
were measured diﬀerently across studies: some measured
television viewing as minutes per hour while some measured
in minutes per week. Due to this level of variation among
studies, meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate even for those
outcomes such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI,
and blood cholesterol where greater standardization of the
measurement existed. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed
by visually evaluating the results for each outcome in tables. When
heterogeneity was suspected, we assessed potential reasons for the
diﬀerences by examining individual study characteristics and those
of subgroups of the main body of evidence.
Assessment of reporting biases
Assessment for reporting biases was conducted. However,
published protocols for all of the studies included in this update
were not identified through our search strategy. Therefore, it is not
possible to know with certainty if all outcomes that were meant to
be reported on actually were in the published reports. It appears,
from the published reports included in this update, that all studies
reported on the outcomes that they intended to as reported in the
Methods sections of the published papers.
Data synthesis
Each study was summarized and described according to
variables such as characteristics of participants, characteristics
of interventions, follow-up, and outcomes measured. Results are
summarized narratively across all outcomes.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Only those subgroup analyses conducted in the primary studies are
reported on. This was limited to age and gender.
Sensitivity analysis
Given meta-analysis was not conducted sensitivity analyses were
not conducted in this review.
R E S U L T S
Description of studies
A total of 13,841 records related to physical activity interventions
with children and adolescents were identified in the original review.
Of these, 302 studies were assessed for eligibility, and 26 were
deemed of suﬀicient quality to be included in the original review.
The most common reasons studies were judged as not relevant
were data on relevant outcomes for children and adolescents (aged
6 to 18 years) were not reported, and the intervention was not an
intervention normally performed by public health professionals.
For example, the intervention was conducted by a physician in a
physician's oﬀice, or by a fitness specialist in a fitness center.
For the update, when the new inclusion and exclusion criteria were
applied (i.e. RCTs only, all children in a school, and intervention
duration of 12 weeks), 12 of the original 26 studies were excluded:
nine because they were not RCTs (Alexandrov 1988; Berenson 1993;
Graf 2005; Klepp 1994; Lionis 1991; Manios 1999; Marcus 1987;
Plotnikoﬀ 1999; Sallis 1997); one was excluded because the study
sample included overweight or obese children only (Carrel 2005a)
and two others were excluded because the intervention was shorter
than 12 weeks (Eliakim 1996; Fardy 1996). Therefore, this update
includes 14 of the original 26 studies (Bayne-Smith 2004; Burke
1998; Bush 1989; Ewart 1998; Haerens 2006; Luepker 1996; Petchers
1988; Robinson 1999; Simon 2004; Stephens 1998; Stone 2003;
Trevino 2004; Verstraete 2006; Walter 1988).
In addition, the search strategy for this update from July 2007 to
October 2011 identified 2378 records related to physical activity
interventions with children and adolescents. Of these, 285 unique
studies were assessed for eligibility. Of the 285 unique studies,
30 met all relevance criteria and were included in this update
(Angelopoulos 2009; Araujo-Soares 2009; Barbeau 2007; Colin-
Ramirez 2010; Dishman 2004; Donnelly 2009; Dorgo 2009; Gentile
2009; Haerens 2009; Jones 2008; Kipping 2008; Kriemler 2010;

2008; Webber 2008; Weeks 2008; Williamson 2007; Wilson 2011;
Young 2006). The most common reasons studies were judged as
not relevant were: the design was not an RCT; data on relevant
outcomes for children and adolescents (aged 6 to 18 years) were
not reported; or the intervention was not school based. This
update includes 44 studies (14 from the original review and 30
from the update), and represents complete data for 36,593 study
participants. A flow diagram depicting these results is presented in
Figure 1. Citations for the 543 excluded studies are available in the
Excluded studies section, and reasons for exclusion are provided in
the Characteristics of excluded studies table.
In addition to the information in the characteristics of Included
studies tables, more detail is provided for each study in Table 1
(overview of included studies), Appendix 3 (summary of baseline
characteristics for each included study), and Appendix 4 (Matrix of
endpoints for each study).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
The majority of studies were conducted in the US (24), Australia
(5), Belgium (3), China (2), and Greece (1). Several other countries,
mostly in Europe, conducted one study each, as well as one study
from Canada and one from India. All but 11 studies involved
children 12 years of age and under at baseline, three of which
included participants who were 16 years at baseline. The majority
of children were between nine to 11 years of age at baseline. Others
also targeted to receive interventions during these studies included
parents, teachers, and cafeteria staﬀ. The majority of studies
evaluated outcomes immediately following the intervention (n
= 34), with one study evaluating outcomes two weeks post
intervention (Wilson 2011), one at three months (Haerens 2009),
three at six months (Burke 1998; Gentile 2009; McManus 2008),
one at nine months (Araujo-Soares 2009), and four at 12
months (Li 2010; Petchers 1988; Salmon 2008; Singh 2009). The
samples were comprised of multiple ethnicities including African-
American, Asian, Australian, European, First Nations/Aboriginal,
Greek, Hispanic, Scandinavian, and white participants. Generally,
the interventions were implemented in urban centers among all
socioeconomic classes.
All studies had intervention components that were delivered in the
school setting. Some projects provided additional interventions
in the home, community, physician oﬀices, local theatre, and
via the telephone or computer. A number of studies (n = 15)
focused primarily on grade school programs that included some
parental involvement (Burke 1998; Bush 1989; Colin-Ramirez 2010;
Ewart 1998; Gentile 2009; Haerens 2006; Lubans 2009; Luepker
1996; Neumark-Sztainer 2010; Petchers 1988; Reed 2008; Robinson
1999; Stone 2003; Trevino 2004; Young 2006). The three most
common intervention providers across the 44 included studies
were classroom teachers (n = 28), members of the research team
(n = 13), and PE teachers (n = 9). Specialist teachers, nurses,
social workers, physicians, volunteers, psychologists, dentists,
nutritionists, and peers were occasionally identified as intervention
providers.
All studies included a control group that represented either a
school or group of schools from a diﬀerent community, city, or
state that did not receive the school-based intervention. However,
in some studies the control schools received other physical
activity promotion interventions provided through other health
organizations or venues or standard PE curriculum. The duration of
the interventions varied greatly from a minimum of 12 weeks to six
years, with six studies reporting intervention periods of three years
or greater (Bush 1989; Donnelly 2009; Luepker 1996; Simon 2004;
Walter 1988; Wang 2008).
Several theoretical models were used to develop the physical
activity interventions, although in several studies it was unclear
if a theoretical model had been used. The most commonly used
theories were social cognitive theory and the health-belief model
while self-determination theory, PRECEDE, social learning theory,
and the transtheoretical model were used to a lesser extent.
Social cognitive theory suggests that motivations and actions
are controlled by thought and in order for behavior change to
occur, an individual will anticipate an outcome by considering:
perceived self-eﬀicacy (the belief in one's capabilities); situation-
outcome (belief that consequences will occur without interfering
personal action); and action-outcome (belief a behavior will lead
to an outcome) (Bandura 1982; Luszczynska 2005). The health-
belief model (Rosenstock 1966) acts on the premise that an
individual's behaviors are aﬀected by perceived susceptibility of
developing health problems, perceived impact of health problems
on one's quality of life, and the belief that changing behavior
will be beneficial in avoiding the health problem (Hochbaum
1958; Rosenstock 1966). PRECEDE uses cues, prompts, and
reinforcements to alter behavior (Skinner 1953). This framework
is a cost-benefit evaluation that provides a comprehensive
structure for assessing health and quality of life needs for
designing, implementing, and evaluating health promotion
programs (Green 1974). Social learning theory proposes that
behavior change is aﬀected by environmental influences, personal
factors, and attributes of the behavior itself (Bandura 1977). The
transtheoretical model suggests that individuals progress through
six stages (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action,
maintenance, and termination) to enable health behavior change
and the individual’s stage of change must match the messages in
order to be eﬀective in changing the behavior (Prochaska 1997).
The studies reported in this review diﬀered in funding levels,
the number of project staﬀ, and the resources available to
deliver the program or training provided for the delivery of the
program. Further, although all of the projects were primarily
school-based, none of the projects used the same combination of
interventions with the same intensity, making each project unique.
However, some similarities with respect to the ways in which
the interventions were delivered were observed. For example,
almost all studies implemented curricula focused on increasing
time spent in physical activity and on increasing knowledge about
the benefits of an active lifestyle. The majority of studies also
distributed printed or audio-visual educational materials primarily
to students, but sometimes to parents as well, ofen in association
with educational sessions. About a quarter of the studies involved
school-based activities other than school curricula (e.g. school
fun nights, walkathons, educational materials or sessions (or
both) for school staﬀ and parents, game equipment). Community-
based interventions, such as training sessions and workshops
for parents and parent involvement in home-based physical
activities (homework), were used in conjunction with school-based
interventions in about half of the studies. Finally, some studies
also reported the use of counseling, health screening, and support
groups.
Risk of bias in included studies
The results of the risk of bias assessment for the 44 studies
are presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3.  The most notable
methodological weakness of these studies was the lack of
blinding of participants, providers, outcome assessors, and data
analysts. More specifically most studies in this review did not have
blinded outcome assessors. For example, for behavioral outcomes
in most studies the data were collected through student self-
report (e.g. time engaged in physical activity, time spent watching
television). It was also likely, though diﬀicult to determine, that the
students were aware of the outcomes being assessed.

Another important limitation of this literature was the lack of
consistency in how outcomes were measured across studies.
While the data collection procedures for the physical health
measures (blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, pulse, and maximal
oxygen uptake (VO2max)) were generally more objective than the
behavioral measures, there were still significant diﬀerences in
how the data were collected. Even BMI, which was measured
most consistently across studies, diﬀered in terms of the amount
of clothing worn by participants. Blood pressure measures were
least consistent where in some studies blood pressure was taken
manually using a mercury sphygmomanometer, and in others
electronically using a Dinamap machine. Furthermore, the timing
of when blood pressure was measured diﬀered significantly across
studies with timing varying between 5 and 15 min following active
periods during school hours. Additionally, in some studies the
average of three measures taken one minute apart were used, in
others five measures were averaged, and in others the second and
third of three measures were averaged. For cholesterol, while the
procedures for taking a blood sample and analyzing the sample
were similar, about half the studies used nonfasting blood samples
and the other half used fasting blood samples. Finally, for the six
studies measuring VO2max half measured blood gases following
exertion, while the other half used pulse rate recovery as a proxy for
maximal oxygen uptake. Data collection methods were reported to
be valid and reliable in a little over half of the included studies. In
the remaining studies it was either unclear whether methods were
valid and reliable or methods were used that were subject to bias.
While all of the studies were RCTs, generally there was little
description across studies of how the randomization sequence

was generated. Another limitation of this literature was unit of
allocation errors. In some of the studies allocation was ofen by
institution (e.g. school) or classroom, but assessment occurred at
the level of the individual. Furthermore, in very few cases were
measures taken to account for clustering eﬀects within schools
and only just over a third of studies (n = 16) reported that they
conducted an ITT analysis. This, along with the other risks of bias
identified in this literature, has likely resulted in an overestimation
of treatment eﬀects.
Components for which many studies were considered to have low
risk of bias were only observed for allocation concealment. For
all but one study, allocation to treatment or intervention groups
occurred at one point in time afer study recruitment, and was
unknown in one other. Studies were also found to be free of
selective reporting; however, because many of these studies did
not have published protocols it is impossible to know for certain
if all outcomes were reported on. For over 90% of studies, all of
the study's prespecified outcomes of interest were reported upon.
For the most part, confounders were adequately controlled in over
50% of studies although for some studies important confounders
such as socioeconomic status and parental education were not
accounted for. Finally, many studies attempted to evaluate the
extent to which the intervention was implemented as intended
(intervention integrity), and some conducted process evaluations
in addition to evaluating intervention eﬀectiveness.  However,
cost-eﬀectiveness was assessed in only one study.  Finally,
adverse eﬀects associated with exposure to the school-based
physical activity interventions were generally not addressed in the
published reports of studies.
Eﬀects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison School-
based physical activity programs for promoting physical activity
and fitness in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years
The outcomes included in this review represent two broad outcome
categories: behavior and physical health status. Specific outcomes
related to behavior included: physical activity rates (five studies),
duration of physical activity (23 studies), and time spent watching
television (16 studies). Specific outcomes of physical health status
included: mean systolic blood pressure (16 studies), mean diastolic
blood pressure (16 studies), blood cholesterol level (10 studies),
BMI (32 studies), VO2max (six studies), and pulse rate (six studies).
Primary outcomes: behavior (physical activity)
Physical activity rates
Seven studies reported results for physical activity rates in the
original review (Alexandrov 1988; Fardy 1996; Klepp 1994; Marcus
1987; Petchers 1988; Simon 2004; Verstraete 2006). However, four
of these were excluded from this update (Alexandrov 1988; Fardy
1996; Klepp 1994; Marcus 1987). In this update an additional two
studies have been added to the results presented in Appendix 5
(Colin-Ramirez 2010; Dishman 2004). In total, this update includes
five studies evaluating the impact of school-based physical activity
interventions on physical activity rates.
Of these, four studies focused on grade school children only (Colin-
Ramirez 2010; Petchers 1988; Simon 2004; Verstraete 2006), and
one reported on grade school and secondary school students
(Dishman 2004). All studies reported results for a mixed sample of
boys and girls combined, except for Dishman 2004, who included
girls only. All but one study evaluated impact on physical activity
rates immediately following the intervention, while Colin-Ramirez
2010, evaluated impact one year post intervention.
The results were mixed. Two of the studies reported statistically
significant positive eﬀects on physical activity rates of children
(Simon 2004; Verstraete 2006), and three did not report statistically
significant eﬀects (Colin-Ramirez 2010; Dishman 2004; Petchers
1988). Simon 2004 reported a statistically significant increase
in physical activity rates in those exposed to the intervention
compared to those in the control group (P < 0.0001), and found that
intervention group children were almost three times more likely
to be physically active outside of school compared to controls (OR
2.74). The 95% CI ranged from 2.01 to 3.75. Verstraete 2006, who
measured MVPA using accelerometers, also reported a statistically
significant diﬀerence in moderate to vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) among children in the intervention group compared to
those in the control group (P < 0.01), although an eﬀect size and
95% CI were not provided. Children in the intervention group
experienced a smaller decrease in MVPA from baseline to follow-
up (57% to 53%) compared to the control group (56% to 44%).
The results reported by Colin-Ramirez 2010 and Dishman 2004 did
not illustrate a trend toward a positive eﬀect, and data to make
this assessment were not available for Petchers 1988. The sample
sizes of the five studies ranged from 235 to 2111 participants. It is
likely all studies had significant power to detect a moderately large
treatment eﬀect. With the exception of Simon, the magnitude of
eﬀect is relatively small.
Of the two studies reporting statistically significant positive eﬀects
the intervention ranged from three months (Verstraete 2006)
to four school years (Simon 2004), while for those reporting
no eﬀect the intervention ranged from one school year to
12 months. Interventions across all studies sought to increase
MVPA in children during school hours, and all but one study
(Verstraete 2006) included changes to the curriculum. Among the
two studies showing statistically significant positive eﬀects, one
involved a comprehensive, intensive intervention comprised of
school curriculum changes, printed education materials, greater
time spent engaged in MVPA during the school day, audio-
visual materials, and community-based strategies, while the
second provided printed education materials, game equipment
for children to play on, with play cards illustrating how the
equipment was to be used. Intervention providers also varied
widely from research staﬀ, to teachers, to physical education (PE)
teachers, nutritionists, and peers. One of the two studies reporting
a statistically significant positive eﬀect used accelerometers to
measure physical activity rates (Verstraete 2006), while all other
studies used self-report.
Generally, those studies not reporting a statistically significant
eﬀect on physical activity rates implemented similar combinations
of interventions, (i.e. school curricula, physical activity sessions,
parental involvement, and some community-based activities).
Studies reporting a statistically significant positive eﬀect diﬀered
slightly from those not reporting an eﬀect on intervention provider,
with the former using PE teachers and research staﬀ, while the latter
used classroom teachers to implement the intervention.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Duration of physical activity
Duration of physical activity was reported in seven studies in the
original review and all but one, Manios 1999, remained in this
update (Bayne-Smith 2004; Ewart 1998; Haerens 2006; Luepker
1996; Robinson 1999; Stone 2003). Interestingly there was no
overlap in studies between those that studied physical activity
rates, and those that studied duration of physical activity. In this
update 16 additional studies were identified that measured the
impact of a school-based intervention on duration of physical
activity (Araujo-Soares 2009; Barbeau 2007; Donnelly 2009; Haerens
2009; Jones 2008; Kriemler 2010; Lubans 2009; McManus 2008;
Neumark-Sztainer 2009; Neumark-Sztainer 2010; Peralta 2009;
Salmon 2008; Webber 2008; Weeks 2008; Williamson 2007; Wilson
2011). In addition, the results of one study in the original review, for
which four-year post intervention data were published in 2008 have
been added (Simon 2004). The results are presented in Appendix
6. In total this update includes 23 studies reporting the impact
of school-based physical activity interventions on physical activity
duration.
Of these, 17 studies reported results for   grade school children
only (Araujo-Soares 2009; Barbeau 2007; Donnelly 2009; Haerens
2006; Haerens 2009; Jones 2008; Kriemler 2010; Luepker 1996;
McManus 2008; Neumark-Sztainer 2009; Peralta 2009; Robinson
1999; Salmon 2008; Stone 2003; Webber 2008; Williamson 2007;
Wilson 2011),  two included grade school and secondary school
students (Lubans 2009; Weeks 2008), and three reported results
for adolescents only (Bayne-Smith 2004; Ewart 1998; Neumark-
Sztainer 2010). The majority of studies reported results for a mixed
sample of boys and girls combined, two reported results for boys
and girls separately, and three included girls only. Most studies
measured impact on physical activity duration immediately post
intervention, while one study measured impact at two weeks post
intervention, one at five months, one at six months, one at nine
months, one at 12 months, and one at four years. The length of the
intervention ranged from 12 weeks to six years, with the median
being one to two school years. Two studies in the original review
(Ewart 1998; Stone 2003), and six in the update measured duration
of physical activity using accelerometers (Kriemler 2010; Lubans
2009; McManus 2008; Peralta 2009; Webber 2008; Wilson 2011),
although the majority still relied on self report.
Among the studies evaluating duration of physical activity among
grade school children only, 12 studies reported statistically
significant positive eﬀects (Araujo-Soares 2009; Barbeau 2007;
Donnelly 2009; Ewart 1998; Haerens 2006; Kriemler 2010; Luepker
1996; McManus 2008; Salmon 2008; Simon 2004; Stone 2003;
Webber 2008), two of which measured duration of physical activity
with accelerometers. However, while Haerens 2006 reported a
statistically significant eﬀect overall, further subgroup analysis
demonstrated a significant eﬀect for boys only. The remaining
studies (n = 5) did not report a statistically significant eﬀect on
physical activity duration among grade school children. Among
the two studies including both grade school and secondary school
children, one did not report statistically significant eﬀects (Lubans
2009), while the second reported a statistically significant eﬀect
in favor of the control group (Weeks 2008). One of three studies
evaluating impact on adolescent girls reported a statistically
significant positive eﬀect (Ewart 1998) and two did not (Bayne-
Smith 2004; Neumark-Sztainer 2010). The sample size of the
studies ranged from 33 participants to 4019. There did not
appear to be a trend indicating that studies with smaller sample
sizes reported non-significant (NS) results more ofen than larger
studies. However, it is possible that some studies with smaller
sample sizes were underpowered to detect statistically significant
changes in physical activity duration.
The magnitude of eﬀect varied across studies reporting statistically
significant eﬀects from just under five min to 45 min more
per week of MVPA, and the CIs ranged from as little as 1.4
min to approximately 90 min more per week of MVPA. Similar
to physical activity rates, these findings generally represent a
relatively modest magnitude of eﬀect. In some studies participants
in the intervention group engaged in MVPA longer than control
group participants at follow-up, while in other studies, those in
the intervention group had a smaller decrease in duration of
physical activity in comparison to control group participants. Of
the 14 studies in total reporting statistically significant positive
eﬀects for children and adolescents combined, the intervention
was implemented over 18 weeks to several years. Generally,
studies reporting statistically significant eﬀects implemented the
intervention over a longer period of time in comparison to
those not reporting statistically significant eﬀects. While specific
combinations of interventions varied there were some similarities
across the studies reporting positive eﬀects. The intervention in all
studies reporting statistically significant eﬀects included changes
to school curricula, and in many studies printed educational
materials. Other interventions included education sessions, audio-
visual materials, support groups, self contracts, and community-
based interventions. The intervention provider in the majority
of studies was classroom teachers; however, other intervention
providers included PE teachers, research workers, peers, and
physical activity instructors. Generally, those studies not reporting
statistically significant eﬀects on duration of physical activity
implemented similar combinations of interventions  (i.e. printed
educational materials, school curricula), by classroom teachers,
but for a shorter period of time (i.e. 12 weeks to 10 months).
Time spent watching television
The impact of school-based interventions on television viewing was
formerly reported by four studies all of which were included in this
update (Burke 1998; Haerens 2006; Robinson 1999; Simon 2004). In
this update 12 additional studies were added (Colin-Ramirez 2010;
Gentile 2009; Jones 2008; Kipping 2008; Lubans 2009; Neumark-
Sztainer 2009; Neumark-Sztainer 2010; Peralta 2009; Salmon 2008;
Singh 2009; Webber 2008; Williamson 2007). In addition four-year
follow-up results for Simon 2004 published in 2008 have been
included in this update. The results are presented in Appendix 7.
In total this update includes 16 studies evaluating the impact of
school-based physical activity interventions on television viewing.
Of these, 13 studies focused on grade school children only (Burke
1998; Colin-Ramirez 2010; Gentile 2009; Haerens 2006; Jones 2008;
Kipping 2008; Neumark-Sztainer 2009; Peralta 2009; Robinson 1999;
Salmon 2008; Simon 2004; Webber 2008; Williamson 2007), two
reported on participants aged 12 to 14 (Lubans 2009; Singh 2009),
and one reported on adolescents only (Neumark-Sztainer 2010).
The results were generally reported for boys and girls combined,
with results for girls only being reported in three studies (Jones
2008; Neumark-Sztainer 2010; Webber 2008), and one for boys only
(Peralta 2009). Just over half of the studies measured television
viewing immediately post intervention, with three measuring
impact at six months (Gentile 2009; Peralta 2009; Neumark-Sztainer
2010) and four at 12 months (Colin-Ramirez 2010; Salmon 2008;

Singh 2009; Webber 2008). All studies measured television viewing
through self-report. The length of the intervention ranged from 12
weeks to two school years, with half of the studies implementing
interventions for 20 weeks or less.
In total seven studies reported statistically significant positive
eﬀects on time spent watching television (Burke 1998; Gentile
2009; Jones 2008; Robinson 1999; Simon 2004; Singh 2009; Webber
2008), and one reported a statistically significant eﬀect in favor
of the control group (Salmon 2008). For the two studies reporting
results for boys and girls separately, one study found a significant
eﬀect in grade school boys six months post intervention, but
not in girls (Burke 1998), and the second study did not report
a statistically significant eﬀect (Haerens 2006). Of the six studies
reporting statistically significant positive results, all demonstrated
a significant decrease in the amount of time children spent
watching television, compared to the control group. The magnitude
of eﬀect ranged from as little as five min less per day to as much
as 60 min less per day of television viewing. For example Robinson
1999 reported a 50-minute decrease in television viewing per day,
compared to 10 min per day in the control group (P < 0.001). Simon
2004 reported that participants exposed to the intervention were
half as likely (OR 0.49) to spend more than three hours per day
watching television compared to those in the control group (P <
0.0001); the 95% CI ranged from 0.35 to 0.69. Burke 1998 reported
that six months post intervention boys exposed to the intervention
watched five min less per day of television compared to those in
the control group (P < 0.01). Two studies, Singh 2009 and Webber
2008, reported results at one year post intervention (3 hours and
1 hour less per week, respectively), while a third study, Gentile
2009, reported results at six months post intervention (2 hours less
per week). Only one study not reporting a statistically significant
eﬀect may have been underpowered to detect a significant eﬀect.
In studies reporting 95% CIs, reduction in television viewing ranged
from approximately one minute less per week to two hours less per
week, generally suggesting modest impact on television viewing,
and drawing into question whether these reductions would result
in reduced risk for the development of chronic diseases.
Among the seven studies reporting statistically significant eﬀects
the length of the interventions varied from 12 weeks to four
years. Generally, there did not appear to be noteworthy diﬀerences
in length of the intervention between studies reporting a
statistically significant eﬀect and those not. School curriculum
was a component in all studies reporting statistically significant
eﬀects, with printed education materials, education sessions,
and community-based strategies being implemented in almost
all studies reporting statistically significant eﬀects. Interventions
occurring in only one study included: counseling, teacher training,
physical activity sessions, audio-visuals materials, mass media,
and support groups. Among studies reporting a statistically
significant positive eﬀect the intervention was more likely to be
implemented by a member of the research team, followed by
classroom teachers. Among studies not reporting a statistically
significant eﬀect, the intervention providers were somewhat more
likely to be classroom teachers.
Secondary outcomes: physical health status
Mean systolic blood pressure
Ten studies reported results for mean systolic blood pressure in
the original review (Alexandrov 1988; Bayne-Smith 2004; Burke
1998; Bush 1989; Ewart 1998; Graf 2005; Lionis 1991; Luepker
1996; Stephens 1998; Walter 1988). However, three were excluded
from the update (Alexandrov 1988; Graf 2005; Lionis 1991). In
this update eight additional studies have been added to the
results presented in Appendix 8 (Angelopoulos 2009; Kriemler 2010;
Martinez 2008; McManus 2008; Reed 2008; Walther 2009; Wang
2008; Young 2006). In addition, four-year post intervention results
for Simon 2004, published in 2008 have been included for a total of
16 studies evaluating the impact of school-based physical activity
interventions on mean systolic blood pressure.
Thirteen of 16 studies reported results for grade school children
only (Angelopoulos 2009; Burke 1998; Bush 1989; Kriemler 2010;
Luepker 1996; Martinez 2008; McManus 2008; Reed 2008; Simon
2004; Stephens 1998; Walter 1988; Walther 2009; Wang 2008),
and three on children attending secondary school (Bayne-Smith
2004; Ewart 1998; Young 2006). All but two of the 13 studies
involving grade school children reported results for the whole
sample (Burke 1998; Martinez 2008), and all three studies involving
students in secondary school included girls only (Bayne-Smith
2004; Ewart 1998; Young 2006). Twelve studies evaluated impact on
mean systolic blood pressure immediately post intervention, while
two measured the outcome at six months (Burke 1998; McManus
2008) one at nine months post intervention (Angelopoulos
2009) and one 4 years post intervention Simon 2004. Nine
of the studies (Angelopoulos 2009; Burke 1998; Kriemler 2010;
Luepker 1996; Martinez 2008; Reed 2008; Simon 2004; Wang
2008; Young 2006), measured blood pressure using an automated
sphygmomanometer and the remainder were taken manually.
Four of the 16 studies reported statistically significant positive
eﬀects on mean systolic blood pressure (Angelopoulos 2009;
Bayne-Smith 2004; Ewart 1998; Reed 2008), two of which used
an automated sphygmomanometer (Angelopoulos 2009; Reed
2008). Two studies, Angelopoulos 2009 and Reed 2008, reported
statistically significant positive eﬀects on grade school children,
and two studies, Ewart 1998 and Bayne-Smith 2004, on secondary
school girls. On average, the intervention group experienced a 2
to 5 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure in comparison to
the control group. The sample sizes of the 12 studies not reporting
statistically significant eﬀects ranged from 90 to 4019 participants.
It is likely that some of these studies were underpowered to detect
a statistically significant eﬀect. Furthermore, only one study (Wang
2008) appeared to demonstrate a trend toward a positive eﬀect,
while the remaining studies showed little to no diﬀerence in systolic
blood pressure between the intervention and control groups.
Of the four studies reporting statistically significant positive
eﬀects the interventions were implemented for 12 weeks (Bayne-
Smith 2004), 18 weeks (Ewart 1998), 11 months (Reed 2008),
and 12 months (Angelopoulos 2009). Among studies reporting no
eﬀect, interventions ranged from 12 weeks to six years. Changes
to the school curriculum were the only consistent component
across all four studies reporting a positive eﬀect. Community-
based strategies were used in two studies, and printed education
materials and education sessions were used in one study each. In
three of the four studies reporting a positive eﬀect the intervention
was provided by members of the research staﬀ (Angelopoulos
2009; Ewart 1998; Reed 2008), and was not stated in the fourth
study (Bayne-Smith 2004). Generally, the studies not reporting a
statistically significant eﬀect on mean systolic blood pressure used
similar combinations of interventions, but tended to use classroom

and PE teachers more ofen, and tended to be implemented
for longer periods of time, in comparison to studies reporting
statistically significant positive eﬀects.
Mean diastolic blood pressure
Nine studies reported results for mean diastolic blood pressure
in the original review (Bayne-Smith 2004; Burke 1998; Bush 1989;
Ewart 1998; Graf 2005; Lionis 1991; Luepker 1996; Stephens 1998;
Walter 1988). However, two were excluded from this update (Graf
2005; Lionis 1991). In this update an additional nine studies
have been added to the results in Appendix 9 (Angelopoulos
2009; Kriemler 2010; Martinez 2008; McManus 2008; Reed 2008;
Walther 2009; Wang 2008; Young 2006), including four-year post
intervention results for Simon 2004 published in 2008.
Thirteen of 16 studies reported results for grade school children
only (Angelopoulos 2009; Burke 1998; Bush 1989; Kriemler 2010;
Luepker 1996; Martinez 2008; McManus 2008; Reed 2008; Simon
2004; Stephens 1998; Walter 1988; Walther 2009; Wang 2008), and
three on children attending secondary school (Bayne-Smith 2004;
Ewart 1998; Young 2006). All but two of the 13 studies involving
grade school children reported results for the whole sample (Burke
1998; Martinez 2008), and all three studies involving students in
secondary school included girls only (Bayne-Smith 2004; Ewart
1998; Young 2006). Twelve studies evaluated impact on mean
diastolic blood pressure immediately post intervention, while two
measured the outcome at six months (Burke 1998; McManus
2008) one at nine months post intervention (Angelopoulos 2009)
and one at four years post intervention (Simon 2004).   Nine
of the studies (Angelopoulos 2009; Burke 1998; Kriemler 2010;
Luepker 1996; Martinez 2008; Reed 2008; Simon 2004; Wang
2008; Young 2006) measured blood pressure using an automated
sphygmomanometer and the remainder were taken manually.
Three of the 16 studies reported statistically significant
positive eﬀects on mean diastolic blood pressure (Angelopoulos
2009; Bayne-Smith 2004; Bush 1989), one of which used an
automated sphygmomanometer (Angelopoulos 2009). Two studies
(Angelopoulos 2009; Bush 1989) reported statistically significant
positive eﬀects on grade school children, while Martinez 2008
reported a statistically significant negative eﬀect on grade school
boys and no eﬀect on girls. Bayne-Smith 2004 reported a significant
positive eﬀect on secondary school girls. Among the three studies
reporting positive eﬀects, on average the intervention group
experienced a 3 to 4 mmHg reduction in mean diastolic blood
pressure in comparison to the control group. Martinez 2008 found
boys in the control group had a 2 mmHg greater reduction in
mean diastolic blood pressure in comparison to boys in the
intervention group. The remaining 12 studies did not report
statistically significant eﬀects on mean diastolic blood pressure,
and no studies showed a trend toward a positive eﬀect. The sample
sizes of the studies ranged from 90 to 4019 participants. It is likely
that some of the studies were underpowered to detect a statistically
significant eﬀect.
Of the three studies reporting statistically significant positive
eﬀects the interventions were implemented for 12 weeks (Bayne-
Smith 2004), 12 months (Angelopoulos 2009), and four years (Bush
1989). Among studies not reporting a statistically significant eﬀect,
interventions ranged from 12 weeks to six years. Changes to the
school curriculum were the only consistent component across
all three studies reporting statistically significant positive eﬀects.
Printed education materials were used in two of the three studies,
and counseling was also used in one study. Intervention providers
included members of the research staﬀ (Angelopoulos 2009;
Bush 1989; Martinez 2008) for studies showing both statistically
significant positive and negative eﬀects. Classroom teachers were
also used in one study reporting a positive eﬀect. Generally,
the studies not reporting a statistically significant eﬀect on
mean diastolic blood pressure used similar combinations of
interventions, but tended to use classroom and PE teachers more
ofen, in comparison to studies reporting a statistically significant
positive eﬀect.
Mean blood cholesterol level
Seven studies reported results for mean total blood cholesterol
level in the original review (Alexandrov 1988; Bayne-Smith 2004;
Bush 1989; Lionis 1991; Luepker 1996; Manios 1999; Walter 1988).
However, three of them have been excluded from this update
(Alexandrov 1988; Lionis 1991; Manios 1999). In this update
an additional five studies have been added to the results in
Appendix 10 (Martinez 2008; Reed 2008; Walther 2009; Wang 2008;
Young 2006). In addition, four-year post intervention results for
Simon 2004, published in 2008, have been added. In total 10
studies evaluating the impact of school-based physical activity
interventions on mean blood cholesterol (mg/dL) were included in
this update.
All but two studies focused on grade school children, with Bayne-
Smith 2004 and Young 2006 including girls in secondary school
only. One of the eight studies focused on grade school children
reported results for boys and girls separately (Martinez 2008),
the remainder reported results for boys and girls combined.
All of the studies evaluated impact on mean blood cholesterol
immediately post intervention. Most studies measured fasting
blood cholesterol.
Only one of the 10 studies reported a statistically significant
positive eﬀect on mean blood cholesterol (Walter 1988), and
in that study only schools in the intervention group from a
higher socioeconomic status reported a statistically significant
positive eﬀect. No other studies reported statistically significant
changes in mean blood cholesterol at the end of the intervention
in comparison to controls. Walter 1988 reported a 2 mg/dL
decrease in mean blood cholesterol among boys and girls of higher
socioeconomic status in comparison to children in the control
group. The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 188 to
4019 participants. It is likely that some of these studies were
underpowered to detect a statistically significant eﬀect. There also
did not appear to be a trend toward a positive eﬀect.
There were no diﬀerences between the one study reporting
a statistically significant positive eﬀect (Walter 1988) and the
remaining studies not reporting a statistically significant eﬀect with
respect to intervention strategies or duration. All studies measuring
mean blood cholesterol (mg/dL) used school curriculum, and the
majority also used printed educational materials. Some also used
community-based strategies (Bush 1989; Luepker 1996; Simon
2004; Walter 1988). The duration ranged from 12 weeks to four
years.
Body mass index (BMI)
Fourteen studies reported results for BMI in the original review

However, five of these were excluded from this update (Alexandrov
1988; Carrel 2005a; Lionis 1991; Manios 1999; Sallis 1997). In this
update an additional 22 studies have been added to the results
presented in Appendix 11 (Angelopoulos 2009; Barbeau 2007;

2008; Williamson 2007; Young 2006). In addition, four year post
intervention results for Simon 2004 published in 2008 have been
added. In total, this update includes 32 studies evaluating the
impact of school-based physical activity interventions on BMI.
Of these, 23 studies focused on grade school children only
(Angelopoulos 2009; Barbeau 2007; Burke 1998; Bush 1989;
Donnelly 2009; Gentile 2009; Haerens 2006; Kipping 2008; Kriemler

2008; Simon 2004; Stone 2003; Walter 1988; Wang 2008; Webber
2008; Williamson 2007), seven on adolescents in secondary school
only (Bayne-Smith 2004; Dorgo 2009; Ewart 1998; Li 2010; Neumark-
Sztainer 2010; Singhal 2010; Young 2006), and two with both grade
school and secondary school children (Singh 2009; Weeks 2008).
Twenty-one of the studies reported results for a mixed sample of
boys and girls combined, five for boys and girls separately (Burke
1998; Haerens 2006; Martinez 2008; Singh 2009; Weeks 2008), six
studies included girls only (Barbeau 2007; Bayne-Smith 2004; Ewart
1998; Neumark-Sztainer 2010; Webber 2008; Young 2006), and one
included only boys (Peralta 2009). Twenty-four of the thirty-two
studies evaluated impact on BMI immediately post-intervention,
three at approximately six months post-intervention (Gentile 2009;
Neumark-Sztainer 2010; Peralta 2009), three at 12 months (Li 2010;
Salmon 2008; Singh 2009), one at three years post-intervention
(Luepker 1996) and one at four years post intervention Simon 2004.
Overall eight of the 32 studies reported statistically significant
positive eﬀects on BMI in favor of the intervention (Angelopoulos
2009; Barbeau 2007; Burke 1998; Haerens 2006; Kriemler 2010; Li
2010; Robinson 1999; Salmon 2008), while one study reported a
statistically significant eﬀect in favor of the control group (Weeks
2008). One additional study showed a strong trend toward a
positive eﬀect following four years of intervention (Simon 2004),
while most did not appear to have a trend toward a positive eﬀect.
Five studies reported statistically significant positive eﬀects on a
mixed sample of boys and girls (Angelopoulos 2009; Kriemler 2010;
Li 2010; Robinson 1999; Salmon 2008), one for boys only (Burke
1998), and two for girls only (Barbeau 2007; Haerens 2006). All
studies reporting a statistically significant positive eﬀect on BMI,
demonstrated a smaller increase in BMI from baseline to follow-
up for those in the intervention group compared to those in the
control group. On average, the intervention group experienced an
increase of 0.1 to 1.0 kg/m2 less in comparison to those in the
control group. In only one study (Salmon 2008) was a larger eﬀect
size noted, with the intervention group gaining 1.5 kg/m2 less than
the control group, with the 95% CI ranging from -2.8 to -0.2 kg/
m2. The eﬀect of baseline weight as a moderating variable varied
among studies. In one study (Singh 2009), a statistically significant
eﬀect on BMI was observed among non-overweight children in the
intervention group, but not among those who were overweight or
obese at baseline. In contrast, another study found the intervention
was only eﬀective in preventing weight gain (increased BMI) among
those children in the intervention group who were overweight or
obese at baseline but not among those who were not overweight
(Li 2010). The sample sizes of the studies ranged from 32 to 4120
participants. While it is likely that some of the studies not reporting
statistically significant eﬀects were underpowered to detect a
statistically significant eﬀect, the majority did have suﬀicient power
to see a significant eﬀect.
Of the eight studies reporting statistically significant positive
eﬀects, the intervention was implemented for six months in
one study (Robinson 1999), nine months in two studies (Burke
1998; Kriemler 2010), 10 months in one study (Barbeau 2007),
one year in three studies (Angelopoulos 2009; Li 2010; Salmon
2008), and two years in one study (Haerens 2006). While specific
combinations of interventions varied there were some similarities
across the eight studies. For example, the intervention in all
studies included changes to the school curriculum. All studies
used printed education materials, while three studies included
community-based strategies (Burke 1998; Haerens 2006; Kriemler
2010), and three included education sessions (Burke 1998; Kriemler
2010; Salmon 2008). Two studies used audio-visual materials (Li
2010; Robinson 1999), and two included physical activity sessions
(Barbeau 2007; Li 2010). Other strategies used by only one study
included support groups (Haerens 2006), counseling (Burke 1998),
and self contracts (Salmon 2008). In four of the studies reporting
a statistically significant positive eﬀect the intervention providers
were classroom teachers (Barbeau 2007; Burke 1998; Haerens 2006;
Robinson 1999), while in two studies PE teachers were primarily
responsible for implementing the intervention (Kriemler 2010;
Salmon 2008). In two studies the intervention was provided by
either members of the research staﬀ or a psychologist,
PE teacher, or a multidisciplinary healthcare team. Generally, the
24 studies not reporting a statistically significant eﬀect on BMI
used similar combinations of interventions implemented by similar
combinations of providers for similar lengths of time.
Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max)
Five studies reported results for VO2max in the original review
(Bayne-Smith 2004; Carrel 2005a; Eliakim 1996; Fardy 1996; Trevino
2004). However, three were excluded from this update (Carrel
2005a; Eliakim 1996; Fardy 1996). In this update four additional
studies have been added to the results presented in Appendix 12
(Barbeau 2007; McManus 2008; Walther 2009; Wang 2008). In total
six studies evaluating the impact of school-based physical activity
interventions on VO2maxwere included.
Of these, five studies focused on grade school children (Barbeau
2007; McManus 2008; Trevino 2004; Walther 2009; Wang 2008) and
one on those attending secondary school (Bayne-Smith 2004). Four
studies reported results for boys and girls combined (McManus
2008; Trevino 2004; Walther 2009; Wang 2008), and two included
girls only (Barbeau 2007; Bayne-Smith 2004). All but one study
evaluated impact on VO2max immediately post intervention, with
the one study reporting results at six months post intervention
(McManus 2008). Two studies measured VO2max through blood
gases afer exertion (Barbeau 2007; McManus 2008), and four
measured heart rate recovery following exertion as a proxy for
VO2max (Bayne-Smith 2004; Trevino 2004; Walther 2009; Wang
2008).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Four of the six studies reported statistically significant positive
eﬀects on VO2max (Barbeau 2007; Trevino 2004; Walther 2009;
Wang 2008). Statistically significant positive eﬀects were observed
among grade school children only. The results illustrate a positive
improvement in VO2max across studies ranging from 1.6 to 3.7 mL/
kg per min, while a fourth study reported a lower heart rate by
4 beats/min afer strenuous exercise following the intervention.
Barbeau 2007 found children in the intervention group increased
their VO2max by 1.6 mL/kg per min, while Trevino 2004 reported
an increase of 1.9 mL/kg per min, and Walther 2009 reported an
increase of 3.7 mL/kg per min. The 95% CIs ranged from 0.2 to 7.2
mL/kg per min. The sample sizes of these two studies ranged from
182 to 1221 participants. It is possible that one of the two studies
not reporting a statistically significant eﬀect was underpowered to
detect a significant diﬀerences.
Studies reporting a positive eﬀect made changes to the school
curriculum, two also included printed education materials, and one
included education sessions. Classroom teachers implemented
the intervention in two of the studies reporting positive eﬀects
and were unknown in the remaining studies. Generally, the two
studies not reporting statistically significant eﬀects used similar
combinations of interventions implemented for similar lengths
of time, although the intervention provider is unknown in these
studies.
Pulse rate
Five studies reported results for pulse rate in the original review
(Bush 1989; Ewart 1998; Luepker 1996; Stephens 1998; Walter 1988).
All of these studies were retained in this update. One additional
study was added in this update (McManus 2008). In total six studies
were included in this update evaluating the impact of school-based
physical activity interventions on pulse rate.
Of these, five studies focused on grade school children (Bush 1989;
Luepker 1996; McManus 2008; Stephens 1998; Walter 1988), and
one on adolescents (Ewart 1998). The results are summarized in
Appendix 13. One study included adolescent females in secondary
school only (Ewart 1998), and the other five studies reported results
for a sample of boys and girls combined. All studies evaluated
impact on pulse rate immediately post intervention.
Only one study reported a statistically significant positive eﬀect
on pulse rate (Luepker 1996). One other study (Stephens 1998)
reported a statistically significant positive eﬀect, but on pulse
rate during maximal exercise and recovery (P < 0.05), rather than
resting pulse rate. Interestingly, Luepker 1996 did not observe a
statistically significant eﬀect immediately following the three-year
intervention, but rather at three years post intervention (P < 0.03).
All five remaining studies did not report a statistically significant
eﬀect. The sample sizes of the studies ranged from 88 to 4019
participants. It is likely that some of the studies were underpowered
to detect a statistically significant eﬀect. Furthermore, of those that
provided data on pulse rate, one demonstrated a trend toward a
positive eﬀect, and the others did not.
D I S C U S S I O N
Summary of main results
Generally the results of this update are for the most part unchanged
from those reported in the original review with two exceptions.
Whereas in the original review we found school-based physical
activity interventions had a positive impact on duration of MVPA,
television viewing, blood cholesterol, and VO2max, in this update,
the positive eﬀect on blood cholesterol was no longer observed.
However, the magnitude of eﬀect for duration of MVPA, television
viewing, and VO2max, remained the same in the update as in the
original review. Also, in this review there is some limited evidence
to suggest that school-based physical activity interventions may
have a positive eﬀect on physical activity rates in children, meaning
there was some limited evidence to suggest that school-based
interventions were eﬀective in increasing the proportion of children
who engaged in MVPA during school hours. This was not observed
in the original review. There is also some limited evidence in this
update that these positive eﬀects are maintained in the longer
term, (i.e. six months to four years), although only a small number
of studies measured outcomes beyond the end of the intervention.
However, this also demonstrates an improvement from the original
review in that evidence now exists, where it did not previously, that
positive eﬀects can be maintained in the longer term on outcomes
such as duration and rate of physical activity, and VO2max.
The evidence suggests that school-based physical activity
interventions of longer duration may be needed to eﬀect change
in duration and rate of physical activity and VO2max among grade
school children. However, the evidence is less convincing for
those attending secondary school. The evidence also suggests that
eﬀective school-based interventions include some combination of
school curricula, printed educational materials, and likely, though
there is less evidence to support it, educational sessions, physical
activity specific sessions, and community-based initiatives. In
order to produce sustainable eﬀects, it may be necessary to
widen the scope of the intervention to include the community so
as to promote multiple environments that support active living
as children move from childhood to adolescence to adulthood.
Community-based strategies have been shown to be somewhat
eﬀective in promoting healthy behavior among populations
(Dobbins 2011). Careful consideration of the similarities between
the study population and local populations may be helpful
in ascertaining the likelihood of local initiatives achieving a
positive eﬀect if the same intervention was implemented. There
is only limited evidence that boys and girls respond diﬀerently
to school-based interventions as well as diﬀerent components of
interventions from the studies included in this review. Given known
gender diﬀerences in determinants of physical activity (DiLorenzo
1998), future research in this field should test various gender-
specific strategies within the school setting.
Given the primary focus of many of the studies was to promote
physical activity it was surprising only five studies reported physical
activity rates as an outcome. In addition, it is interesting to
note that there was no overlap in studies measuring rates of
physical activity and those measuring duration. However, in this
update significantly more studies measured duration of MVPA (n
= 23) representing a positive trend toward the measurement of
important outcomes when evaluating the eﬀectiveness of physical
activity promotion interventions.
In this update there continues to be limited overlap between those
studies measuring physical activity rate or duration and VO2max.
For example, there was only one study that measured both physical
activity rate and VO2max in the original review and one other that

measured duration of physical activity and VO2max. Afer excluding
studies based on the revised inclusion/exclusion criteria, in this
update there were no studies measuring both physical activity
rate and VO2max, and only three studies measuring both physical
activity duration and VO2max.
While new evidence suggests some promise with respect to the
longer-term impact of school-based physical activity interventions
on physical activity duration and rate, and VO2max, ongoing eﬀorts
to evaluate impact in the long term are needed. It is important,
especially for those interventions having positive eﬀects, for
outcomes to be measured in the long term so that these results
can better inform policy and program decision making at multiple
levels.
All of the interventions included in this review were multifaceted
interventions focused on changing multiple risk behaviors
associated with adult-onset CVD. Some of the multiple components
addressed in these studies were physical activity, nutrition,
and smoking. Although empirical evidence (Thomas 1999) and
theoretical frameworks suggest that CVD risk reduction strategies
should target multiple high-risk behaviors simultaneously, it is
unclear from the results of this update how these multicomponent
strategies interact to impact on indicators of physical activity or
fitness measures. Given that exposure (dose) to the physical activity
interventions was assessed in just a small number of studies,
it is conceivable that more emphasis was placed on CVD risk
reduction strategies other than physical activity, thereby providing
insuﬀicient exposure to physical activity interventions to produce
significant behavioral or fitness changes. An alternative hypothesis
might be that children and adolescents have a limited capacity at
any given time to adopt new behaviors and absorb new knowledge,
and interventions simultaneously addressing multiple factors such
as nutrition, physical activity, and smoking, may be overwhelming.
At this time there is some limited evidence to suggest that school-
based physical activity interventions have a small to moderate
impact on behavioral outcomes related to physical activity as well
as on one physical health status measure. However, at best the
evidence is of moderate risk of bias, and therefore must be used
cautiously. Furthermore, adverse eﬀects as a result of the school-
based physical activity interventions were generally not reported
upon by the studies included in this update. Future studies should
seek to determine if there are any adverse eﬀects experienced by
children and adolescents as a result of the intervention.
Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
A comprehensive search of RCTs was conducted. While it is possible
that some studies were missed by our search strategy, we anticipate
that this number would be small, and that the results of our
review have not been significantly impacted upon. The studies
included in this review are generally applicable to public health
practice in developed countries. However, it is not clear if these
findings are applicable to low- and middle-income countries
particularly among those where the public health sector system or
school systems (or both) are diﬀerent, or when cultural diﬀerences
are taken into account. Future research should evaluate school-
based physical activity interventions in low- and middle-income
countries.
Quality of the evidence
As discussed previously there are a number of limitations inherent
in the studies included in this review that reduce the overall
methodological quality of this evidence. As such the results must be
interpreted cautiously and likely overestimate the true treatment
eﬀect. Specific limitations include: lack of blinding particularly
of outcome assessors, lack of consistency in how outcomes are
measured, reliance on self-reported outcomes for most behavioral
outcomes, and a lack of description of the process used to
randomly allocate participants to intervention and control groups.
Furthermore, a number of studies experienced high attrition rates
as well as incomplete outcome data. This as well likely contributed
to an overestimation of the treatment eﬀect, given those engaging
in the intervention may have been more likely to complete
the study and data collection, and therefore biasing the results
toward a positive eﬀect. However, on a positive note, significant
improvements in the quality of the evidence were observed from
the original review to this update.
While the majority of outcomes were assessed using measures
with at least some degree of demonstrated reliability and validity,
most of the behavioral outcomes were measured through self-
report (except for a small, albeit growing, number of studies
using accelerometers), while the physical health status outcomes
were measured through more objective means. In only nine of
25 studies were more objective outcome measurements obtained
from pedometers or accelerometers on time spent engaged in
physical activity, and only one of 14 studies did not rely on self-
report to measure time spent watching television. For physical
health status measures such as systolic and diastolic blood
pressure and BMI, in almost all studies it is unclear if the outcome
assessors were blinded to study allocation. This represents an
important risk of bias for this literature and likely resulted in
either overestimating the treatment eﬀect or finding a statistically
significant positive eﬀect where one did not exist. This alone may
explain why a positive impact was observed for the behavioral
outcomes, while a positive eﬀect was observed for only one of the
six physical health status outcomes.
However, the explanation cannot be so simplistic, at least not for
duration of physical activity. For this outcome, 14 of 23 studies
demonstrated a positive eﬀect, and of those five studies measured
duration of physical activity with an accelerometer. This detracts
from the argument that the ways in which the outcomes were
measured is responsible for the diﬀerence in positive eﬀects
observed between the behavioral outcomes versus the physical
health status outcomes.
Potential biases in the review process
It is possible that bias was introduced during the review process
despite the implementation of strategies to reduce bias. Most
notably, it was not possible to conduct searches in databases that
are not English. For example articles published in Chinese that
were not indexed in English language databases were not eligible
for inclusion. However, the review team recognizes a growing
body of evidence in physical activity promotion being produced in
Chinese. It is likely in subsequent updates that additional search
strategies to ensure non-English publications are assessed for
eligibility. Given a meta-analysis was not conducted, it is possible
that the review team may have overestimated treatment eﬀects
when interpreting the results across studies. While eﬀorts were

undertaken to minimize this bias (multiple review authors were
involved in interpreting the results and provided comments on
drafs of this update) it is still possible that we have interpreted the
results to be more positive than they actually are. Consumers of
this review are cautioned therefore to examine the results carefully
across studies.
The variability in these findings may be indicative of the limitations
and diﬀiculties inherent in doing community-based research where
randomization to treatment groups, blind assessment, reliable and
valid outcome measures, and prevention of co-intervention are
diﬀicult to control. It also demonstrates the diﬀiculty in measuring
outcomes associated with physical activity, both from a physiologic
as well as a behavior perspective. Inconsistent findings in these
studies can further be attributed to: a) variability in strategies used
and in the frequency, intensity, and duration of interventions; b)
the use of various theoretical models to guide the intervention; c)
using a variety of instruments with varying reliability and validity
to assess physical activity or physical fitness (or both); and d)
follow-up periods of diﬀerent durations. Many of these studies
have reported modest change in levels of physical activity, physical
fitness rates, or both. Lack of change in leisure time physical
activity or physical fitness, in turn, has been attributed most
ofen to issues of: a) inadequate dose (Tolfrey 2000); b) poor
compliance (Baranowski 1990); c) inattention to the multiplicity of
risk factors for physical inactivity and subsequent overly simplistic,
unidimensional interventions; d) methodologic errors in measuring
fitness (e.g. assessing heart rate only afer, as opposed to during,
activity); and e) a failure to control for potentially confounding
variables (Tolfrey 2000).
Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews
The findings of this update are consistent with the findings of
reviews conducted by Flynn 2006, Reilly 2003, Thomas 2004a,
and Waters 2011, who reported mixed results regarding the
eﬀectiveness of interventions to prevent obesity, promote healthy
eating, and promote physical activity in children and adolescents.
An additional review by Hillsdon 2005 also reported similar results
among adults for interventions to promote physical activity.
Furthermore, a review of studies evaluating the impact of physical
activity interventions reported increased physical activity among
adolescent girls (Brown 2009), and another found a positive eﬀect
on fitness measures in children generally (Trudeau 2008). Others
have found that while children and adolescents can experience
increased levels of MVPA, this does not necessarily translate into
reduced BMI (Cawley 2007; Gonzalez-Suarez 2009; Harris 2009).
Similar results were reported by Summerbell 2005, who found
little to no impact of obesity prevention interventions in children.
However, an update to this review by Waters 2011 indicated there is
evidence to suggest that obesity prevention strategies are eﬀective
in reducing BMI among children aged 6 to 12 years. However, it
is important to point out that there was significant heterogeneity
of results across studies and that overall, the magnitude of
eﬀect reported by Waters 2011 generally was small. Another
meta-analysis of school-based obesity prevention interventions
found a positive eﬀect on weight, and clearly argued the need
for ongoing school-based intervention (Katz 2009). While these
additional reviews suggest that school-based interventions may be
eﬀective in preventing and reducing obesity in children, the result
of our update indicate that focusing on physical activity may be
insuﬀicient to address issues of healthy weight adequately, and
that a comprehensive approach focused on physical activity and
diet, at a minimum, may be needed to impact weight in children
significantly. Furthermore, the results of Waters 2011 illustrate
that strategies outside of the school setting in addition to school-
based strategies are likely needed. The findings of this update
as well as other reviews suggest that schools are an important
setting in which to promote physical activity. Almost all recent
reviews illustrate that school-based physical activity interventions
do result in children and adolescents spending more time engaged
in MVPA and in some instances this translates into improved fitness
measures. The finding in this review that changes to BMI were not
observed, does not suggest that school-based interventions are not
eﬀective, but may suggest that a more comprehensive approach
(e.g. home, community, policy) is needed and as suggested in the
original review, that BMI may not be an appropriate measure to
evaluated the eﬀectiveness of interventions to promote physical
activity among children. Future reviews should consider additional
outcomes such as percentage body fat and abdominal girth.

Implications for practice
The implications for public health practice, based on the findings
of this update, are not as clear as one might wish. Nonetheless,
the following are suggestions for consideration by public health
practitioners, decision makers, and policy makers at this time.
1. Since 
school-based 
physical 
activity 
interventions 
are
associated with some positive eﬀects, such activities should
continue and be encouraged by public health to local schools
and school boards.
2. School-based physical activity interventions should be focused
on fostering positive attitudes toward physical activity and
should be geared toward the developmental level of students.
3. Teachers and school staﬀ should encourage children and
adolescents to be more physically activity during the course of
the school day. This may require some dramatic changes within
the working environment of teachers and school staﬀ.
4. Parental involvement could be an integral part of school-based
interventions.
5. More emphasis should be placed on promoting physical activity
within school-based interventions (i.e. making physical activity
a priority along with other healthy behaviors).
6. Public health staﬀ should work in collaboration with teachers,
schools, and school boards to lobby local and provincial policy
makers to increase resources for the promotion of physical
activity within the school system.
Implications for research
There are many gaps in the literature that require considerable
exploration, and subsequently, systematic reviews.
1. Research must take care to assess the impact of school-based
physical activity interventions more ofen on physical activity
rates and duration and intensity of physical activity.
2. More research is needed to assess the validity and
appropriateness 
of 
outcomes 
that 
represent 
program
eﬀectiveness of school-based physical activity interventions for
children and adolescents. Additional outcomes that should be

assessed to evaluate intervention eﬀectiveness should include:
student satisfaction, health-related quality of life, self-esteem,
self-eﬀicacy for physical activity, reduction in alcohol/drug
consumption, involvement in extracurricular activities, and
cost-eﬀectiveness.
3. Research is needed to assess the impact of physical activity
strategies that take into account the known barriers and
facilitators of physical activity among children and adolescents,
particularly among those of various socioeconomic status and
ethnicity and urban/rural location.
4. Additional subgroup analysis including an examination of the
diﬀerences in physical activity by gender as well as age and
ethnicity, and the impact of strategies that take into account the
diﬀerent factors that aﬀect physical activity among males and
females and children and adolescents must be examined.
5. All outcomes related to the impact of school-based physical
activity interventions require follow-up data so that the long-
term impact of these interventions can be determined.
6. To increase the depth of knowledge in this field, national
granting agencies need to make research related to physical
activity promotion a major priority and recognize the need
to fund projects that span multiple years of intervention
implementation and evaluation.

Intervention: 12-month program (January 2005 to January 2006) integrated in the existing school cur-
riculum in combination with physical education (PE) and science and environmental classes, providing
the least possible disturbance. Program material included a student's workbook and teacher's manu-
al, which offered activities for use in class in an appendix. The manual covered: self-esteem, body im-
age, nutrition, physical activity, fitness and environmental issues, and materials were used 1 to 2 h per
week. Motivational methods and strategies were used to increase knowledge (i.e. discussion, active
learning, cues), increase skills and self efficacy (i.e. modeling, guided practice, enactment), achieve bet-
ter self-monitoring (i.e. problem solving, goal setting), improve attitudes and beliefs (i.e. self re-eval-
uation, environmental re-evaluation, arguments, modeling, direct experience), and modify social in-
fluence (i.e. modeling, mobilizing social support). School teachers trained by the research team deliv-
ered the intervention and there was a home component for which parental involvement was required
to provide reinforcement

Intervention: 10-month after-school physical activity (PA) program on body composition and cardio-
vascular fitness in young black girls, offered every school day during the school year with transporta-
tion (i.e. school bus service) provided to encourage participation. 30 min of homework time while sub-
jects received a free, healthy snack, and 80 min of PA. Snacks were individually packaged, and every
day offered something salty (e.g. crackers and cheese), something sweet (e.g. low-fat cookies), or a
fruit or vegetable. Subjects chose 1 snack with the option of another if they wished. The PA included
25 min of skill development, 35 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), with 20 min of
toning and stretching. Subjects wore Polar Accurex Plus HR monitors (Port Washington, NY) every day
and were instructed to maintain their heart rate above 150 beats/min during the MVPA. MVPA activi-
ties included games such as basketball, tag, softball, relay races, etc., modified for activity of all sub-
jects through the 35-min period. Subjects received small weekly prizes for behavior and attitude, and
for having no more than 1 unexcused absence. A student of the month in each school received a slight-
ly larger prize with the prizes intended to reward good behavior, participation, and effort. Parents were
called when students had 2 consecutive unexcused absences, with reasons discussed and parents en-
couraged to send their daughter back to the program. Teachers mostly worked the intervention in their
own school and in some cases were assigned to work in a different school. Teachers received formal
training with background information on childhood obesity, PA, and cardiovascular risk factors, study

Role playing was a large component of the training; teachers were asked to prepare a lesson plan for
1 day and did a shortened simulation of it, so feedback could be provided. A Manual of Procedures for
each school included all information needed to implement the intervention, including several potential
activities. Teachers hired after the training received one-on-one training on the theoretical aspects and
observed several sessions before their own implementation

Duration: 12 weeks 
Intervention: the PATH curriculum was taught as a personal wellness course that integrated vigorous
exercise, health and nutrition education, and behavior modification. PATH student manuals were de-
veloped to provide students with information about the anatomy and physiology of the heart, cardio-
vascular risk factors, the heart disease process, proper exercise and nutrition, stress management, cig-
arette smoking avoidance and cessation techniques, and strategies for modifying high-risk health be-
haviors. PATH teacher manuals were provided to physical education (PE) teachers containing instruc-
tions for teaching the program curriculum and assessing outcomes. PE teachers using the PATH cur-
riculum received in-service training from the investigation team before and during the intervention.
The PATH program consisted of 30-min classes conducted 5 days per week for 12 weeks. Individual
classes began with a 5- to 10-min lecture and discussion featuring a topic on cardiovascular health and
fitness and suggestions for modifying health behaviors. In addition, students frequently were given
homework assignments designed to enhance or clarify lecture material through use of the PATH manu-
als. The lecture and discussion were followed by 20 to 25 min of vigorous physical activity in the form of
either resistance exercise to improve muscular strength and endurance or aerobic exercise to improve
cardiovascular fitness. Students alternated resistance and aerobic training each day. Resistance exer-
cise consisted of a vigorous program of circuit weight training at a variety of isotonic and isokinetic ex-
ercise stations. Students performed 90- to 120-second bouts of weight lifting at 50% to 70% of the 1-
repetition maximum (the maximum resistance that can be lifted 1 time). Aerobic training included a va-
riety of vigorous exercises, such as stationary bicycling, stair stepping, rope jumping, fast walking, jog-
ging, step aerobics, and aerobic dance. Students were instructed to exercise continuously at 70% to
85% of their age-predicted maximum heart rate. Students were taught how to self-monitor heart rates
during or immediately upon cessation of exercise by palpation of the radial or carotid pulse 
Control: the frequency and duration of traditional PE classes were identical to those of PATH classes.
Since PE classes did not have lecture and discussion, they had approximately 5 min more physical ac-
tivity per class than PATH classes

Setting: school, home, unstated if urban or rural 
Provider: teachers, research staﬀ, parents 
Duration: 9 months 
Intervention 1: standard physical activity (PA) and nutrition program (WASPAN) in 6 schools, which
consisted of classroom lessons to establish a rationale, plus 20-min fitness sessions daily by means
of small group activities that allowed for individual fitness levels and provided a range of options by
means of progression through graded activities. Four fitness sessions per week were considered a re-
alistic expectation. The nutrition program aimed to improve children's diets by prompting families to
review their diets; reducing consumption of fat, sugar, and salt; increasing fiber intake; and creating
links between home and school for health promotion. The nutrition program is built around 4 comic
books in which 2 space creatures must discover the dietary habits of humans. It includes a Teachers'
Handbook, Home-based Mission Booklet, Class Activities Booklet, Incentives, and a Recipe Booklet that
presents recipes written for children by children. Home-based Missions and Class Activities are com-
bined in activities such as planning a week's grocery shopping on the basis of advertised prices and in
learning strategies to resist peer pressure. The Incentives Booklet includes a progress chart, stickers,
and a completion certificate to encourage participation from children and parents. Duration of nutri-
tion class activities aimed for 1 hour per week. 
Intervention 2: standard WASPAN program plus a PA-enrichment program for higher-risk children in 7
schools, which consisted of incorporating the teacher-parent-student triad and allowed for PA needs
and preferences to be met outside the setting of the whole class. Children kept regular, but not con-
tinuous, 7-day PA diaries, which were used by teachers to identify preferred activities and ways these
might be increased in duration or frequency. Teachers and students worked together to establish goals
and decide on how these might be attained. Parents were asked to monitor completion of the diaries
and to encourage increased levels of PA 
Control: no program in 5 schools

Setting: grade school, urban
Provider: mixed – a) health teams including a physician, dentist, psychologist, nurse, social worker, b)
classroom teachers, physical education (PE) teachers
Duration: 2 academic years
Intervention: RESCATE program, included physical activity and nutritional components. Physical activ-
ity was addressed at 3 levels: individual, school, and family. At the 'individual level', classroom lessons
and exercise breaks were implemented. The educational component in the classroom involved weekly
30-min lessons that emphasized the importance of physical activity, delivered by trained health teams
(a physician, a dentist, a psychologist, a nurse and a social worker). Exercise breaks in the classroom
lasting 2–10 min were designed to increase energy output and promote physical activity in the class-
room. The TAKE 10 program of classroom physical activity was adapted for this purpose and included
in the procedure manual for the classroom teachers who led the exercises. 'School-level' intervention
included PE classes. The aim of this component of the program was to increase the length of time that
children participated in moderate to strenuous exercise during PE classes. For 30 min twice a week,
there was a substitution of regular exercise during PE classes for new ones that required moderate to
vigorous energy output. PE teachers received a manual with the appropriate exercise options. 'Family
level' involved family members in support and reinforcement of classroom lessons. Each child received
a book of activities to take home with exercises that corresponded to the lessons at school and was im-
plemented with collaboration with his parents. In addition, the parents received recommendations for
achieving a more active lifestyle. Recommendations included decreasing time spent on sedentary ac-
tivities such as watching television, using a computer or playing video games

Intervention: Lifestyle Education for Activity Program (LEAP), a comprehensive school-based interven-
tion that emphasized changes in instruction and the school environment. Designed to increase phys-
ical activity in high-school girls by creating a school environment that supported the unique physical
activity needs and interests of adolescent girls. Aimed to increase girls' self-efficacy for physical activ-
ity, via physical education (PE), school environment, health education, school health services, facul-
ty or staﬀ health promotion, and parent and community involvement. The intervention staﬀ assisted
teachers to develop curricula designed to help adolescent girls enhance physical activity self-efficacy
through successful experiences with physical activity both inside and outside of school and develop
physical and behavioral skills necessary to adopt a physically active lifestyle during the teenage years
and to maintain it through adulthood. Teachers at each school developed behavioral skill instructional
units that emphasized the acquisition and practice of self-regulatory behaviors (e.g. goal setting, time
management, identifying and overcoming barriers, and self-reinforcement); the units were implement-
ed in health education, biology, family and consumer science, or PE, depending on how each school
provided health education. The PE component developed motor skills in a variety of physical activities
that were popular with high-school girls including aerobics, weight training, dance, and self-defence
using approaches that favored small groups and cooperative and successful learning experiences. In
addition to facilitating noncompetitive mastery of skills, the instruction also used modeling of success,
encouragement, and moderately intense exercise directed toward enhancing self-efficacy 
Control: standard PE as part of school curriculum

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Setting: school, urban 
Provider: teachers 
Duration: 2 years 
Intervention 1: physical activity (PA) and nutrition intervention. The PA intervention focused on in-
creasing levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) to at least 60 min per day. Schools re-
ceived an intervention box with sports materials such as ropes, balls, and beach ball sets and were en-
couraged to create more noncompetitive opportunities to be physically active during breaks, at noon
or during after-school hours, and to vary content of PAs offered. Children received a physical fitness
test at the beginning of the second intervention year where all children had to cycle for 10 min on a
computerized cycle ergometer, then were given information on their fitness levels and possible ways
to improve it. The computer-tailored portion of the intervention was completed once each school year
during 1 class hour. Children completed PA questions on a computer screen, which was immediate-
ly followed by tailored feedback on the screen (e.g. normative feedback regarding activity levels, PA
recommendations). The nutrition intervention focused on 3 behavioral changes: (i) increasing fruit
consumption 2+ pieces/day, (ii) reducing sof drink consumption and increasing water consumption,
and, (iii) reducing fat intake. Schools were asked to sell fruit at very low prices or for free at least once a
week, to offer fruit for dessert at lunch, and to offer free water via drinking fountains 
Intervention 2: PA and nutrition intervention (same as Intervention 1 group) plus parental involvement.
Schools invited parents for an interactive meeting on healthy food, PA and the relationship with over-
weight and health. Three times per year, information on healthy food and PA was published in school
papers and newsletters for parents, and parents received a free CD with the adult computer-tailored
intervention for fat intake and PA (same as the children's computer tailored intervention) for use at
home, and asked to discuss results with their child and to give their child support to create a healthier
lifestyle

Intervention: computer tailored physical activity (PA) program consisting of 3 parts: (a) an introduction
page, (b) a diagnostic tool, and (c) advice. The questionnaire used in the diagnostic tool could be filled
out on the computer screen and consisted of a demographic questionnaire, a PA questionnaire, and a
questionnaire on psychosocial determinants. After questionnaires were completed, feedback was se-
lected out of a database with messages for each possible combination of answers (e.g. normative feed-
back that related students' PA levels to the PA guidelines). 
Control: 1.5pg advice including information on the benefits of PA, public health recommendations, dif-
ferences between moderate and vigorous intensity activities, and tips on how to become more active.
The information was a selection of the most essential information in the tailored advice, but not tai-
lored to each individual.

Country: US 
Setting: school, unstated if urban or rural 
Provider: peer, physical education (PE) teachers and other teachers 
Duration: 1.5 school years 
Intervention: the IMPACT intervention included 3 major components: 1) a health curriculum for grades
6 and 7 (classroom lessons and behavioral journalism); 2) a PE program; and 3) a school food service
component that emphasized calcium-rich food choices). Peer-based behavioral journalism involved
the use of media (e.g. school-based newsletter with role model stories). The intervention used a 6th
grade health curriculum, including 16 sessions that were implemented during PE classes, 3 times per
week. The lessons in this curriculum promoted increased consumption of calcium-rich foods and in-
creased weight-bearing physical activities. The curriculum also contained behaviorally based and ac-
tive lessons adapted to the PE environment. Science-based lessons were administered during 7th
grade science classes. The PE component of the program (i.e. "IMPACTivities") was implemented in the
6th and 7th grades during PE and athletics classes. The classes contained an initial 10-min warm-up
(i.e. high-impact activities - rope-jumping, circuit training, and box-step activities) 
Control: the control group participated in the usual health program

taught mostly outdoors by PE teachers. Three to five 2 to 5-min activity breaks (motor skill tasks - jump-
ing or balancing on 1 leg, power games, coordinative tasks) were provided each day during academic
lessons. The children also received daily physical activity homework (10 min' worth), prepared by the
PE teachers, including: aerobic, strength, or motor skill tasks (e.g. brushing their teeth while standing
on 1 leg, hopping up and down the stairs, rope jumping, or comparable activities)

als provided included: activity cards (each activity card introduced 1 exercise and explained how to
perform it); video demonstrations (showing students from the pilot study performing the activities;
teachers could either demonstrate the activity or show it on a video); and tracking posters and stick-
ers (used to illustrate the progress of each class). Teachers (i.e. classroom tutors, health educators, or
both) attended a half-day training session (conducted by the staﬀ of the National Institute for Nutri-
tion and Food Safety, China CDC) to learn how to integrate the program into the school curriculum, and
how to perform the activities. The training also included information about childhood obesity, risk fac-
tors, health consequences, and prevention. Activities (taken from TAKE 10! Program) included: "invis-
ible jump rope"; "copy cat"; "all about you"; "stories on the move!"; and "stories in space". Students,
teachers, and parents were encouraged to develop new activity models along with program staﬀ (and
included: "story in zoo"; "story in farm"; "who is wearing yellow today"; "time like a colt"; "happy and
health"; and "little frog"). All activities were of moderate to vigorous intensities. Each 10-min session
included: 1) the teacher or student selected an activity card(s) - 1 to 3 activities were performed at each
session; 2) several children were chosen to model the exercise(s) in the front of the classroom with the
other students following along; 3) a cool-down period following the activities; and 4) the students were
taught a health message

Country: Australia 
Setting: school, home, unstated whether urban or rural 
Provider: teachers 
Duration: unstated 
Intervention: the intervention group (Program X intervention, based on the LEAF pilot study) included
the same school sport program (as the control), however, with the following additions/alterations: 1)
enhanced school sport program, delivered once a week for 10 weeks, focusing on lifetime physical ac-
tivities that can be continued into adulthood (e.g. aerobics, weight training); 2) information sessions
and interactive summary lecture focusing on physical activity and healthy eating; 3) pedometers for
physical activity monitoring over the 6-month intervention; 4) physical activity and nutrition hand-
books and monthly information newsletters for parents (designed to educate parents on strategies to
support the health behaviors taught to their children in Program X); and 5) social support for physical
activity and dietary behavior change using e-mail. Teachers introduced 1 of 10 physical activity and nu-
trition messages (selected because they represent the behaviors commonly associated with lower lev-
els of disease risk and maintaining a healthy weight) at the beginning of each school sport session and
delivered an activity reinforcing the message. These messages included: 1) Keep track of your physi-
cal activity (using goals/diary); 2) every step counts; 3) reduce your time spent watching television, us-
ing the computer, and playing electronic games immediately after school; 4) be active with friends and
family; 5) identify excuses for not being active; 6) keep track of fruit and vegetable intake (using goals/
diary); 7) aim for 2 pieces of fruit and 5 servings of vegetables each day; 8) drink more water and swap
sugary drinks for diet drinks; 9) reduce your portion sizes and eat at the dinner table; and 10) reduce
your junk food snacks. A member of the research team delivered an interactive lecture summarizing
the 10 messages following the 10-week school sport component of the study. 
Control: the control group attended a 10-week school sport program and were given instructions (ex-
ercise program booklet) on how to complete the school sport sessions. They were not given any of the
'Program X messages' or additional materials or strategies to support behavior change or nutrition be-
haviors

Intervention (overview): The CATCH intervention included school-based (school food service, physical
education, classroom curricula) and family-based (home curricula, family fun nights) components. The
school food service changes and physical education enhancement were ongoing throughout the 3 school
years whereas the classroom and home curricula were implemented (by classroom teachers) over a fixed
time period during each school year and addressed eating habits (grades 3 through 5), physical activity
(grades 4 and 5), and cigarette smoking (grade 5 only). Eat Smart, the food service intervention, provided
children with healthy meals that maintained recommended levels of essential nutrients and child partic-

ipation in the school meal programs. Food service personnel attended a 1-day training session at the be-
ginning of each school year. They were provided with more information, assistance in planning, and other
support during monthly follow-up visits to the schools and booster sessions. The physical education spe-
cialists and teachers attended 1 to 1.5 days of training every school year. The classroom curricula includ-
ed: the Adventures of Hearty Heart and Friends (grade 3 to 15, 30- to 40-min classes during 5 weeks); Go for
Healths (grade 4 to 24, 30- to 40-mi classes during 12 weeks); and Go for Health-5 (grade 5 to 16, 30- to 40-
min classes during 8 weeks) and F.A.C.T.S. for Five (grade 5 - 4-session tobacco use prevention curriculum).
The classroom teachers attended 1 to 1.5 days of training every year to learn how to implement the curric-
ula. For the home curriculum, 19 activity packets (over the course of 3 school years) that complemented
the classroom curricula were sent home with the students and required adult participation to complete.
During grades 3 and 4, students invited their family members to a "family fun night" (dance performances,
food booths, recipe distribution, games). The intervention schools were further randomized into 2 equal
subgroups 
Intervention 1: One group received a school-based program consisting of school food service modifica-
tions, physical education interventions, and the CATCH curricula 
Intervention 2: One group received the same school-based program plus a family-based program 
Control: the control group received the usual health curricula, physical education, and food service
programs, but none of the CATCH interventions

Intervention 1: educational program group completed a 2-week education program using targeted
materials, providing learner guidance and feedback, and promoting retention of the desired behav-
ior. Content included heart rate monitor skills and education about heart health, goal-setting, and role
play. Heart rate monitor skills and goal setting included: information about activity targets (light, mod-
erate, vigorous); daily activity accumulation to achieve 30 to 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity
activity (MVPA); and how to use a heart rate monitor for feedback about progression to this goal. This
content was taught via an active games approach and a take home booklet. Following the education-
al program, children in the 2 intervention groups completed 2 weeks with heart rate feedback and 2
weeks without heart rate feedback (counterbalanced) 
Intervention 2: no-education program group completed a 2-week control program (physical educa-
tion classes without physical activity or heart health education). Following the educational program,
children in the 2 intervention groups completed 2 weeks with heart rate feedback and 2 weeks without
heart rate feedback (counterbalanced). The No-education Program Group were not given any informa-

Provider: unstated 
Duration: approximately 16 weeks 
Intervention: the intervention included 3 components: 1) 14 x 2-hour after-school theatre sessions; 2) 8
weekly after-school booster sessions; and 3) family outreach to enhance home support for behavioral
changes through positive reinforcement of health behaviors, parent-child participation in physical ac-
tivities, and availability of healthy foods. Each theatre session included: 1) a 'check-in' in which children
were given an opportunity to share any behavioral changes they had made over the past week (e.g. eat-
ing more fruits and vegetables) and talk about how take-home packages were received by families; 2)
easy-to-prepare healthy snacks; 3) a movement component of fun and easy activities requiring mini-
mal resources (e.g. dancing or walking); and 4) theatrical ACTivities. For the initial sessions, the ACTiv-
ities component included exercises to introduce the children to theatre techniques and to build trust
and cooperation. In later sessions, the ACTivities focused on enhancing knowledge and skills related
to physical activity and healthy eating and promoting a positive body image through interactive activi-
ties. Children were asked to share their personal experiences related to being active and eating health-
fully. The content of the script for the Ready. Set. ACTION! play was developed through these activities.
During the final sessions, children were introduced to the script and began to rehearse for the final play

performance. The booster sessions included activities such as: creating advertisements for fruits and
vegetables; painting positive affirmations (e.g. I am special) on a mirror to take home; brainstorming
ways to be active while watching television (e.g. doing jumping jacks during commercials); teaching
dance and strength training exercises to their classmates; learning exercises to do at home with their
families; and rehearsals for the school performance of the Ready. Set. ACTION! play. For the family out-
reach component, Weekly Fun and Fitness packs (i.e. a healthy food with a simple recipe or fitness in-
centives for the family) and a CD of the Ready. Set. ACTION! songs were sent home (each pack also had
a parent postcard with information and interactive activities on a topic addressed in the after-school
program). There were also 2 family events: 1) the students' performance of the play; and 2) a 'Ready.
Set. ACTION! DVD Release Party' (i.e. a family viewing of the DVD recording of the play production, a
short performance by the children, and a communal family dinner)

semester of the school year. They also received the New Moves curriculum during their PE class (ap-
proximately 16 weeks) and participated in New Moves activities throughout the rest of the school year
(maintenance period). This program included: 1) the New Moves PE class - nutrition and social sup-
port/self-empowerment sessions (physical activity (Be Fit) 4 days/week taught by school PE teachers (3
days) and community guest instructors (1 day) and nutrition (Be Fueled) or social support/self-empow-
erment (Be Fab) classes 1 day/week); 2) individual counseling sessions using motivation interviewing
techniques (to set personal goals for behavioral change based on eight New Moves objectives); 3) lunch
get-togethers ("lunch bunches") once a week during the maintenance period where participants were
served healthy food and engaged in informal discussions on New Moves topics; and 4) minimal parent
outreach activities (i.e. 6 postcards sent home to reinforce New Moves messages and a parent-daugh-
ter retreat day focused on New Moves messages during the maintenance period). PE teachers attend-
ed full-day training before the intervention and half-day training during the intervention. They also re-
ceived regular, ongoing support from New Moves staﬀ throughout the program. New Moves interven-
tion staﬀ ran all program components aside from the PE class. These staﬀ received training and ongo-
ing support in motivational interviewing techniques 
Control: the control group continued to participate in the all-girls PE class during the first semester of

Country: Australia 
Setting: school, unstated if urban or rural 
Provider: research worker, lay person, physical education (PE) teacher 
Duration: 16 weeks 
Intervention: the intervention program was primarily based on Social Cognitive Theory, with 16 pro-
gram weeks, with each week comprising 1 x 60-min curriculum session and 2 x 20-min lunchtime phys-
ical activity sessions. Each 60-min curriculum session included practical and/or theoretical compo-
nents focused on promoting physical activity through increasing physical self-esteem and self-effica-
cy, reducing time spent in small screen recreation on weekends, decreasing sweetened beverage con-
sumption, and increasing fruit consumption and the acquisition and practice of self-regulatory behav-
iors such as goal setting, time management, and identifying and overcoming barriers. Behavior mod-
ification techniques (e.g. group goals converting time spent in physical activity to kilometers to reach
a specified destination, and the use of incentives) were used. The practical component included mod-
ified games and activities. The researcher primarily facilitated the intervention with staﬀ and parents'
involvement. A Program Champion (PE teacher) liaised with School Executive and other staﬀ to pro-
mote the program within the school and assist with logistical requirements. Eleventh grade students
peer facilitated lunchtime sessions, based on their potential to be positive role models and had one 20-
min training session. Parents were emailed 6 newsletters throughout, informing them of the program
content, motivating them, and suggesting strategies to engage the family in healthy behaviors, creat-
ing a stronger connection between parents and the school 
Control: participated in 16 x 60-min physical activity curriculum at the same time as the intervention
group, with a school PE teacher facilitating the control group

Heart Association provided training for teachers. In total, 14 training covered relevant content and hu-
manistic education teaching techniques. Training was supplemented by a comprehensive teachers'
manual with specific objectives for each module, suggested time frames and alternative activities for
teachers to select those most compatible with their own teaching styles. 
Control: control classes received the traditional curriculum with approximately the same amount of
teaching time. Control group teachers were provided an alternative experience to the training sessions
for the intervention group in the form of a separate in-service training day (general literature and lec-
tures by a cardiologist and an educator

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Duration: 11 months 
Intervention: the Action Schools! BC model was consistent with the 'active school' framework and em-
phasized an integrated whole-school approach rather than traditional classroom-based health educa-
tion, targeting 6 Action Zones: i) School Environment, ii) Scheduled Physical Education, iii) Extracurric-
ular, (iv) School Spirit, v) Family and Community and vi) Classroom Action. Classroom Action was the
only prescriptive component of the AS! BC model in which teachers delivered 15 min of moderate to in-
tense physical activity daily to achieve 75 min of extra physical activity per week (in addition to 2 x 40
min physical education (PE) classes). Teachers provided opportunities to 'snack on physical activities'
such as skipping, dancing, and resistance exercises throughout the day. A school Action Team – com-
prised of the school principal, teachers, or both - was convened in each school and an AS! BC facilitator
worked with Action Teams to design a program with activities across the 6 Action Zones. A 1-day train-
ing workshop was held for INT teachers, who were provided a Classroom Action Bin with resources to
support their Action Plan with the goal for each school to provide students with 150 min of physical ac-
tivity per week (2 x 40 min PE classes and 15 x 5 min per day of Classroom Action) 
Control: teachers in usual practice schools continued their regular program of PE and school-based
physical activity

Cognitive Theory it involved 18 lessons of 30 to 50 min as part of standard curriculum, taught by reg-
ular classroom teachers trained by research staﬀ. Most lessons occurred in the first 2 months of the
year and early lessons included self-monitoring and self-reporting for TV and video game use followed
by a 10-day TV turnoﬀ challenge after which students were encouraged to follow a 7-h per week bud-
get. Newsletters designed to help parents motivate students and regulate time spent on TV and video
games for the entire family were distributed. Each household received 1 (or more if requested) TV time

Country: Australia 
Setting: school, urban 
Provider: specialist physical education (PE) teacher 
Duration: 1 school year 
Intervention: students were assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: a behavioral modification group (BM; N = 69);
a fundamental motor skills group (FMS; N = 73); a combined BM and FMS group (N = 90). Components
of the intervention program were developed by the study team, with others adapted from previous in-
terventions (SPARK), concepts outlined in Robinson's study, from Planet Health, and from the Victo-
rian Fundamental Motor Skills program. BM condition: included 19 sessions of 40 to 50 min' duration
over 3 school terms by the intervention specialist teacher, with different aims for each set of lessons
(e.g. increasing awareness of time-use, health benefits of physical activity, self-monitoring time spent
in sedentary behaviors and physical activity, raising awareness of the home and community environ-
ments in relation to choices and opportunities, decision-making skills, developing their own physical
activities and games, 'intelligent viewing', a 'Switch-oﬀ Challenge', and intermittent reinforcement
schedule with a small reward). FMS condition: 19 sessions of 40 to 50 min over 3 school terms taught by
the same intervention specialist teacher who delivered the BM intervention. The FMS intervention fo-
cused on 6 skills, including 3 object control skills and 3 locomotor skills. Skills were taught with an em-
phasis on fun through games and maximum involvement for all the children. Most lessons focused on
at least 2 skills, and each skill was a focus lesson in at least 6 or more sessions

practices with indigenous learning modes (e.g. story telling) incorporated. Classroom component: 2 x
45-min lessons delivered by teachers weekly for 12 weeks during grades 3 and 4, decreased to 8 weeks
in grade 5. Food service component: nutrient guidelines and tools for reducing fat content of school
meals while meeting nutrient requirements. Food service staﬀ provided skill-building for planning, pur-
chasing, and preparing lower-fat school meals. PE component: a minimum of 3 x 30-min sessions per
week of moderate to vigorous physical activity based on SPARK. Family component: assistance creat-
ing a supportive environment with an interactive forum to discuss Pathways and additionally, 1) family
action packs, and 2) family events at schools

and agreed on rules with the children about the use and the loss or damage of the game equipment to
assure its endurance. The teachers were advised to divide the game equipment into different sets and
to exchange those sets regularly to prevent children losing interest in the equipment. Children were
only allowed to play with the equipment of their own class. The set of game equipment for each class
group included 2 jump ropes, 2 double Dutch ropes, 2 scoop sets, 2 flying discs, 2 catchballs, 1 poco bal,
1 plastic bal, 2 plastic hoops, 2 super grips, 3 juggling scarves, 6 juggling rings, 6 juggling beanballs, 1
diabolo, 1 angel-stick, 4 spinning plates, 2 sets of badminton racquets and 2 sets of oversized beach
paddles.

Intervention: special curriculum targeting voluntary changes in risk behavior in the area of diet, phys-
ical activity, and smoking. Curriculum content was designed to provide the information and motiva-
tion necessary for behavioral changes, as well as training in the skills necessary to make such changes.
The intervention foci (perceived susceptibility to, and severity of health problems, perceived benefits
of and barriers to adopting and maintaining risk-reduction types of behavior) were derived from the
Health Belief Model, skills training strategies were derived from Social Learning Theory. Cognitive-de-
velopment theory provided a framework for the appropriate tailoring of these constructs to the chil-
dren's changing maturational stages ad the study progressed over a 5-year period. The physical activity
component of the intervention fostered the adoption of a regular program of endurance exercise. The
special curriculum was taught in classrooms by specially trained regular teachers for approximately 2
hours per week throughout each school year.

activities. The snacks were provided through the US Department of Agriculture's National School Lunch
and Child and Adult Care Food Programs in cooperation with the school nutrition service. The academ-
ic enrichment activities were incorporated into the program to ensure that participation in the FitKid
intervention during the after-school hours would not damage the academic progress of the children.
The 80 min of physical activity included a variety of activities designed to improve sport skills, aerobic

Country: US 
Setting: community, school, unstated whether urban or rural 
Provider: research staﬀ, community groups, teachers 
Duration: 2 years 
Intervention: TAAG health education included 6 lessons in each of the 7th and 8th grades designed to
enhance behavioral skills known to influence physical activity participation. Activity challenges associ-
ated with the lessons reinforced the contents, encouraged self-monitoring, and set goals for behavior
change. To meet the varying formats in which health education was taught at the school, TAAG health
education was offered in 2 forms: 1 for a traditional classroom setting and 1 for physical education (PE)
class. TAAG PE class promoted moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for at least 50% of class
time and encouraged teachers to promote physical activity outside of class. Activities targeted to cre-
ate (1) environmental and organizational changes supportive of physical activity and (2) cues, mes-
sages, and incentives to be more physically active. Specifically, the intervention was designed to es-
tablish more opportunities, improve social support and norms, and increase self-efficacy, outcome ex-
pectations, and behavioral skills to foster greater MVPA. 35 to 40 girls were the focus of the interven-
tion; however, health and PE classes were part of the usual school curriculum and most included boys
as well. An innovative feature of the intervention was linking school and community agencies to devel-
op and promote physical activity programs for girls. These programs were delivered both on and oﬀ
school property, in most cases either before or after school

The Healthy Eating and Exercise (HEE) and Alcohol/Tobacco/Drug abuse prevention (ADT) programs were
developed as environmental approaches for weight gain. The primary components of the programs were
to alter the physical and social environment of the schools. Both programs were rationally linked to a
“Wise Mind” concept, which was a central feature of both programs, thus allowing the use of Wise Mind
as the name for the program (as a whole), as opposed to just one intervention arm of the study. The Wise
Mind concept represents the idea that with knowledge and environmental changes, students can make
wise decisions about nutrition, physical activity, and substance use/abuse. The environmental changes
were designed to alter the ecology of the school environments, including policy, personal, social, cultural,
and physical environmental changes. 
Intervention: Healthy Eating and Exercise (HEE) program, designed with the goal of preventing inap-
propriate weight gain by modifying the school environment to improve healthy eating habits, increase
physical activity, and decrease sedentary behavior at school and to encourage these same behavioral
changes outside the school environment. The goal of the physical activity program was to increase
physical activity during the school day and at home. Teachers were provided with containers filled with
indoor play supplies (e.g. balloons, bean bags) and outdoor play supplies (e.g. balls, jump ropes) to
promote active play during class time and recess. Posters encouraged the use of these physical activi-
ty centers (PACs), and brief lesson plans provided academic games that used the supplies contained in
the PACs 
Control: Alcohol/Tobacco/Drug abuse prevention (ADT) program, designed with the goal of modify-
ing children's beliefs and attitudes regarding the use and abuse of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs so
that they reflected "healthier" values

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Duration: 17 weeks
Intervention: ACT, a 17-week program implemented on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays for 2 hours
after school. On Wednesdays students practiced what they had learned in the after-school program in
their home environment. A trained team leader, with expertise in implementing physical activities (PA)
in youth, provided the structure for the ACT intervention program implementation. The program had 3
main components: homework/snack (30 min), moderate to vigorous physical activities (MVPA) (60 min)
that students selected each week, and a behavioral skills and motivational component (30 min) during
which intervention staﬀ worked with participants on developing strategies for increasing their MVPA in
their home environment. The ACT intervention specifically targeted development of behavioral skills
(communication, reciprocity of social support, group goal setting, and behavioral competence) for in-
creasing PA outside of program days. In addition, the ACT after-school program social environment (au-
tonomy, choice, participation, belongingness, fun, enjoyment, support) was designed to have a posi-
tive impact on cognitive mediators (self-confidence, perceived competence) and motivational orienta-
tion (intrinsic motivation, commitment, positive self-concept) to promote long-term PA behavior. 
Control: the General Health Education Program (comparison program) focused on nutrition, stress
management, drug prevention, and drop-out prevention (with no PA component). The program con-
sisted of a homework/snack (30 min) and 3 hands-on activities related to general health (30 min each).
The comparison program was held on the same days and times as the ACT intervention program.

Interventions
Country: US
Setting: school, urban
Provider: teacher hired by project
Duration: 1 year (school year)
Intervention: the intervention was taught by a teacher hired by the project. Intervention content in-
cluded information to make an informed decision about the personal benefits of a physically active
lifestyle, develop problem-solving skills, and obtain support from others. Specific strategies that were
taught and reinforced included goal setting, problem-solving barriers, communication skills, reinforce-
ment of goal achievement through internal and external rewards, and learning from relevant role mod-
els. Skills were taught using class lectures and discussions, small-group discussions, and homework ac-
tivities. Physical activity self-monitoring was given a strong focus. Students were encouraged to keep
weekly exercise logs from which the teacher provided feedback on progress toward goal attainment
and reward strategies. All students in class received the intervention, irrespective of whether they were
trial participants. The intervention was also designed to maximize physical activity during physical ed-
ucation (PE) class. The format was congruent with the school's PE curriculum - 1 semester of individual
sports and 1 semester of team sports - taught 5 days per week. Classes were optimized for physical ac-
tivity by teaching units that were active in nature (e.g. soccer instead of softball (personal fitness unit)),
breaking skills training into small-group activities, and playing games in small groups (e.g. 3-on-3 bas-
ketball). Skills training was limited to that needed for competency rather than proficiency. Written tests
focused on health-related physical activity and fitness concepts and behavioral skills. The family sup-
port component consisted of a family workshop, monthly newsletters, and adult-child homework as-
signments. A 2-hour family workshop, scheduled shortly after randomization, featured tips on how par-
ents could provide support to their daughters. As an in-class activity, students worked on skits illustrat-
ing support strategies that were videotaped and viewed at the workshop. Families who did not attend
were mailed copies. Families also received a 2-page family support newsletter each month that con-
tained an article on ways families can support physical activity with their daughter 
Control: standard PE class was a curriculum in which students were taught skills in individual and team
sports. For example, during the basketball unit, students were taught how to dribble, shoot, and pass,
and were tested on concepts such as game rules and defense strategies. Similar to the intervention
structure, 1 semester focused on individual sports and the other on team sports. Classes were taught
by certified PE teachers employed by the school. Parents of participants in the standard PE class also
received monthly newsletters. Topics were of general health interests and included an article about PE
class content that month

vational methods used for increasing knowledge,
skills and self-efficacy and improving self-monitor-
ing and social influence. School teachers trained
by the research team delivered the intervention.

team member supervised preparation for each ses-
sion, before which each student was asked to keep
a diary for a period of 1 week. After the intervention
they were asked to keep the diary for an addition-
al 2 weeks. Worksheets and a 3-min film were used,
and each student received a leaflet with main top-

program consisted of 30 min of homework time
with a healthy snack, and 80 min of PA (25 min skill
development, 35 min MVPA, and 20 min of toning
and stretching). Activities during the MVPA includ-
ed games such as basketball, tag, softball, relay
races, etc., all of which were modified to keep all of
the subjects active throughout the 35-min period.
Subjects received small weekly prizes (e.g. boun-
cy balls, slinkies, pencils, note pads, lip gloss, play
jewelry) for maintaining good behavior and atti-
tude and at most 1 unexcused absence. Absences
were discussed with parents. Teachers providing
the intervention were trained on childhood obesi-
ty, PA, and CV risk factors, the goals of the study,
the specific protocol to be followed, and the types
of activities appropriate for each segment of the in-
tervention and manuals were provided to schools

with the 'active school' framework and empha-
sized an integrated whole-school approach rather
than traditional classroom-based health educa-
tion, targeting 6 Action Zones: i) School Environ-
ment, ii) Scheduled Physical Education, iii) Ex-
tracurricular, (iv) School Spirit, v) Family and Com-
munity, and vi) Classroom Action. Classroom Ac-
tion included 15 min of moderate to intense PA dai-
ly (75 min of extra PA per week in addition to 2 x
40 min PE classes). Teachers provided opportuni-
ties to 'snack on physical activities' such as skip-
ping, dancing, and resistance exercises through-
out the day. A school Action Team was convened
in each school with a facilitator who helped to de-
sign a program with activities across the 6 Action
Zones. INT teachers received a 1-day training work-
shop and a Classroom Action Bin with resources,
with the goal for each school to provide students
with 150 min of PA/week (2 x 40 min PE classes + 15
x 5 min/day Classroom Action)

Cluster RCT
I: 12-month program integrated into the existing curriculum in-
cluding: student workbook, teacher manual; covering themes:
self-esteem, body image, nutrition, PA, fitness, environmen-
tal issues. Implemented for 1 to 2 hours per week with motiva-
tional methods used for increasing knowledge, skills, and self-
efficacy and improving self-monitoring and social influence.
School teachers trained by the research team delivered the in-
tervention. Parental involvement (reinforcement) was required
to complete some (unspecified) home activities

I: 2 x 90-min PA sessions with related homework. A trained psy-
chologist delivered the intervention, assisted by a sports edu-
cation teacher. A research team member supervised prepara-
tion for each session, before which each student was asked to
keep a diary for a period of 1 week. After the intervention they
were asked to keep the diary for an additional 2 weeks. Work-
sheets and a 3-min film were used, and each student received a

modified to keep all of the subjects active throughout the 35-
min period. Subjects received small weekly prizes (e.g. boun-
cy balls, slinkies, pencils, note pads, lip gloss, play jewelry) for
maintaining good behavior and attitude and at most 1 unex-
cused absence. Absences were discussed with parents. Teach-
ers providing the intervention were trained on childhood obe-
sity, PA, and CV risk factors, the goals of the study, the specific
protocol to be followed, and the types of activities appropriate
for each segment of the intervention and manuals were provid-
ed to schools 
 
C: not specified
Bayne-Smith 2004
RCT
I: the intervention (PATH program) consisted of 30-min classes
conducted 5 days per week for 12 weeks. Classes included: 1)
brief lecture/discussion on featured topics (CV health and fit-
ness, health behaviors); and 2) 20 to 25 min of vigorous PA (e.g.
resistance exercise, endurance or aerobic exercise, alternated
each day) 
 
C: the frequency/duration of PE classes were the same as PATH
classes (but without lecture/discussion, so 5 extra min of PA
each class)

Reed 2008
Cluster RCT
I: the Action Schools! BC model was consistent with the 'active

approach rather than traditional classroom-based health ed-
ucation, targeting 6 Action Zones: i) School Environment, ii)
Scheduled Physical Education, iii) Extra-curricular, (iv) School
Spirit, v) Family and Community and vi) Classroom Action.
Classroom Action included 15 min of moderate to intense phys-
ical activity daily (75 min of extra PA per week in addition to 2 x
40 min PE classes). Teachers provided opportunities to 'snack
on physical activities' such as skipping, dancing, and resistance
exercises throughout the day. A school Action Team was con-
vened in each school with a facilitator who helped to design a
program with activities across the 6 Action Zones. INT teach-
ers received a 1-day training workshop and a Classroom Action
Bin with resources, with the goal for each school to provide stu-
dents with 150 min of PA/week (2 x 40 min PE classes + 15 x 5
min/day Classroom Action)

year and included self-monitoring and self-reporting for televi-
sion and video game use followed by a 10-day television turnoﬀ
challenge after which students were encouraged to follow a 7-
h per week budget. Newsletters designed to help parents moti-
vate students and regulate time spent on television and video
games for the entire family were distributed. Each household
received television time master(s) to regulate television and

consisting of 5 min of warm-up and stretching, plus 20 min of
aerobic activity. Activities incorporated repetitive movements
of large muscle groups, designed to elevate the pulse rate 40–
60 beats over resting level. Sessions ended with a 5–10 min
cool-down with presentation of educational material about nu-
trition, exercise, and disease prevention 
 
C: students in the control classroom received no additional PA
beyond regular PE classes

I: 6 TAAG health education lessons per school year to enhance
behavioral skills known to influence PA participation (self-mon-
itoring, setting goals for behavior change). Offered in 2 forms: 1
for a traditional classroom setting and 1 for PE class. Girls were
the focus of the intervention; however, health and PE classes
were part of the usual school curriculum and most included
boys as well

Cluster RCT
I: Healthy Eating and Exercise (HEE) program; goal was to in-
crease PA during the school day and at home. Teachers were
provided with containers filled with indoor play supplies (e.g.
balloons, bean bags) and outdoor play supplies (e.g. balls, jump
ropes) to promote active play during class time and recess.
Posters encouraged the use of these physical activity centers
(PACs), and brief lesson plans provided academic games that
used the supplies contained in the PACs

C: Alcohol/Tobacco/Drug abuse prevention (ADT) program, de-
signed with the goal of modifying children’s beliefs and atti-
tudes regarding the use and abuse of tobacco, alcohol, and il-
licit drugs so that they reflected "healthier" values
Wilson 2011
Cluster RCT
I: ACT, a 17-week program implemented for 2 hours, 3 days/
week by a trained instructor. Three main components: home-
work/snack (30 min), MVPA activities (60 min) that students
selected each week, and a behavioral skills and motivational
component (30 min) 
 
C: the General Health Education Program (comparison pro-
gram) focused on nutrition, stress management, drug preven-
tion, and drop-out prevention (with no PA component), and
consisted of a homework/snack (30 min) and 3 hands-on activ-
ities related to general health (30 min each). The comparison
program was held on the same days and times as the ACT inter-
vention program
Social Cognitive

Young 2006
RCT
I: included information to make an informed decision about
the personal benefits of a physically active lifestyle, develop
problem-solving skills, and obtain support from others. Specif-
ic strategies taught by a trained teacher included: goal setting,
problem-solving barriers, communication skills, reinforcement
of goal achievement through internal and external rewards,
and learning from relevant role models. The PA portion of the
intervention was congruent with the school's PE curriculum (1
semester of individual sports and 1 semester of team sports)
taught 5 days per week. The family support component consist-
ed of a family workshop, monthly newsletters, and adult-child
homework assignments 
 
C: standard PE class in which students were taught skills in in-
dividual and team sports. Similar to the intervention structure,
1 semester focused on individual sports and the other on team
sports. Classes were taught by qualified PE teachers employed
by the school. Parents of participants in the standard PE class
also received monthly newsletters

PA was assessed with the International Physi-
cal Activity Questionnaire for adolescents using
the 7-day recall method. Children indicated how
many sessions of activities they had engaged in
and how long each lasted. From this question-
naire a measure of general MVPA and exercise
was derived consisting of a composite score that
multiplied the frequency of sessions per week
with minutes per session.

tered Physical Activity Checklist (SAPAC), as
well as with the Calcium, Osteoporosis and
Physical Activity (COPA) questionnaire. The
SAPAC had an additional section for seden-
tary activities such as TV and video watching
at 3 time periods during the previous day
It is worth noting that the control group spent
a lot more time in sedentary behaviours at
follow-up than they had at baseline, and al-
so that the control group had much lower
sedentary behavior at baseline than the inter-
vention group

col began with a 4-min warm up at 0% grade
and 2.0 mph. The speed was then increased 0.5
mph every 2 min until reaching 3.0 mph, at which
time the grade increased to 2% for 2 min, then in-
creased an additional 3% every 2 min until reach-
ing 20% grade or exhaustion

Peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) was assessed
from a walk-run treadmill test to volitional ex-
haustion. If maximum was not reached at the end
of the running stages, speed was held constant
and the gradient increased by 2% each minute
until exhaustion. Respiratory gas samples were
analyzed using an Oxycon Pro metabolic cart.
The system was calibrated before each test with
gases of known concentrations. Peak VO2 was ac-
cepted as a maximal effort when at least 2 of the
following were achieved: (i) respiratory exchange
ratio over 1.0 (ii) heart-rate within 5% of the age-
predicted maximum(iii) leveled heart-rate over
the ﬁnal stages (iv) intense signs of effort such as
facial ﬂushing, sweating, hyperpnea

Change in Scope: Three new relevance criteria added and ap-
plied to all included studies: 1) Randomized controlled trial; 2)
Intervention implemented for a minimum of 12 weeks; 3) Inter-
vention aimed at general population. This resulted in 12 studies
from the original review being excluded from the update: 9 be-
cause they were not RCTs (Alexandrov 1988; Berenson 1993; Graf
2005; Klepp 1994; Lionis 1991; Manios 1999; Marcus 1987; Plot-
nikoff 1999; Sallis 1997); 2 because the intervention was shorter
than twelve weeks (Eliakim 1996; Fardy 1996); and 1 because the
study sample included overweight or obese children only (Carrel
2005a)

Significant diﬀerences between the protocol and review exist including the addition of risk of bias and overview of study population tables.
Changes were made to the inclusion criteria afer consulting with the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group because of the large
number of studies published since 2008. On 11 March 2010, review authors decided to exclude studies that did not provide the intervention
to the general population of elementary students. This decision was made because in a number of developed countries more than half of
school attending children are overweight. The purpose of this review is to determine if school-based intervention, directed at otherwise
healthy children. On 29 April 2010, review authors decided to limit their scope by including only RCTs and studies where the intervention
was implemented for a minimum of 12 weeks. Similar criteria have been implemented in recent Cochrane reviews. This resulted in 12 of
the 26 studies included in the original review being excluded in this update. In the original review, studies of very poor methodological
quality were excluded from the review. In this update, all studies identified for the update meeting the relevance criteria, were included
regardless of the level of bias.
