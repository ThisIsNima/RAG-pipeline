The ligands for programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), an immunoinhibi-
tory receptor belonging to CD28/cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4
family, are PD-1 ligand 1 and 2 (PD-Ls). Recent reports suggest that
the aberrant expression of PD-Ls on tumor cells impairs antitumor
immunity, resulting in the immune evasion of the tumor cells.
Although an inverse correlation between the expression level of
PD-Ls and patients’ prognosis has been reported for several ma-
lignant tumors, the follow-up period was limited because of the
lack of the antibody (Ab) applicable to parafﬁn-embedded speci-
mens. Here we generated a new Ab against PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)
and analyzed the expression level of PD-Ls in human ovarian cancer
using parafﬁn-embedded specimens. Patients with higher expres-
sion of PD-L1 had a signiﬁcantly poorer prognosis than patients
with lower expression. Although patients with higher expression
of PD-1 ligand 2 also had a poorer prognosis, the difference was not
statistically signiﬁcant. A signiﬁcant inverse correlation was ob-
served between PD-L1 expression and the intraepithelial CD8 T
lymphocyte count, suggesting that PD-L1 on tumor cells directly
suppresses antitumor CD8 T cells. Multivariate analysis showed
the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and intraepithelial CD8 T
lymphocyte count are independent prognostic factors. The PD-1/
PD-L pathway can be a good target for restoring antitumor immu-
nity in ovarian cancer.

R
ecent developments in treatment modalities including wide
resection-based surgery and new chemotherapy regimens
have achieved a marked improvement in the short-term survival
of patients with ovarian cancer (1–3). Nevertheless, the long-
term prognosis in advanced cases remains unsatisfactory, requir-
ing a new paradigm in the treatment strategy. Various prognostic
factors have been proposed and used clinically to predict the
clinical course and to aid clinical decision-making in ovarian
cancer patients. Currently, the clinical staging system of the
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, which
focuses on the extent of the disease, is extensively used to predict
the prognosis of the patients (4). However, even using this
system, prediction of the long-term prognosis, especially of late
recurrence after remission, remains difficult, suggesting a need
to introduce other parameters such as sensitivity to chemother-
apy and the strength of antitumor immune response. Several
reports have shown the significance of tumor-infiltrating lym-
phocytes (TILs) as a prognostic factor in malignant tumors such
as cutaneous melanoma, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer,
renal cancer, and ovarian cancer, suggesting that immunological
parameters are significant and useful in assessing the prognosis
of cancer patients (5–9). However, there are few reports sug-
gesting that a specific molecule can represent the extent of the
host–tumor immunity.
It is usually assumed that, although tumors are persistently
exposed to host immune attack, they evade this attack via an
immunological phenomenon termed as ‘‘tumor immune es-
cape.’’ A unique feature of this phenomenon is that tumors
frequently use physiological immunosuppressive mechanisms to
escape from host immunity. For example, tumors secrete various
immunosuppressive factors such as transforming growth factor 
and the soluble MHC class I chain-related molecule (10–12),
express immunosuppressive molecules such as Fas ligand (13), or
induce the expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 on T
cells (14, 15). Recently, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), an
immunoinhibitory receptor belonging to the CD28 family, has
been found to play a critical role in the tumor immune escape
(16, 17). PD-1 expressed on activated T and B cells inhibits their
activation by recruiting protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2
(18–20). Two ligands for PD-1, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; B7-H1)
and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2; B7-DC), have been identified based
on the similarity to other B7 family molecules (21–24). PD-L1 is
expressed on T cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and
some nonimmune cells and is up-regulated after their activation.
PD-L2 is regulated more tightly and is expressed mainly on
activated macrophages and dendritic cells. PD-1 ligand 1 and 2
(PD-Ls) expressed on antigen-presenting cells have been shown
to induce T cell anergy or apoptosis via PD-1 on T cells, whereas
PD-L1 expressed on peripheral tissues directly suppresses self-
reactive lymphocytes (16, 17).
It was recently reported that PD-Ls are also expressed in
several malignant tumors including carcinomas of the esophagus,
kidney, lung, and brain. Moreover, the expression levels of these
molecules have been shown to correlate with the prognosis of the
patient in some cases (25–29). However, most of the studies have
been conducted on frozen specimens because of the lack of an
appropriate anti-human PD-L1 antibody (Ab) that can stain
PD-L1 on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, which
is essential for the long-term follow-up. Thompson et al. (30)
examined the expression of PD-L1 on paraffin-embedded spec-
imens of renal cell carcinoma using an original antigen retrieval
method. However, the percentage of patients with PD-L1-
positive tumors is significantly lower than that reported in their
previous study on frozen specimens, suggesting that their result

may not reflect the actual expression of PD-L1 (28, 30). Al-
though it is also reported that PD-L1 is expressed in ovarian
cancer using a small number of cases (25, 31), its clinical
significance as a prognostic factor has not yet been explored.
Moreover, there is little information on PD-L2 expression in
tumors, except for esophageal and lung cancer (26, 32).
In the present study we generated a new Ab against human
PD-L1 that strongly recognizes human PD-L1 protein on formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens and examined the long-term
prognostic value of PD-L1 expression in ovarian cancer. In accor-
dance with former studies on other cancers using frozen specimens,
patients with PD-L1-positive tumors had a significantly poorer
prognosis. A significant inverse correlation was found between
PD-L1 expression and intraepithelial CD8 T lymphocyte count,
indicating that PD-L1 on tumor cells inhibit the host–tumor im-
munity and facilitate the immune evasion of the tumors. These
results suggest that the PD-L1 expression is a reliable prognostic
parameter in ovarian cancer.
Results
Clinical Profiles of the Patients. The average age of the patients was
55 years (range, 26–78; SD, 11.18 years). Of 70 patients, 27
(38.6%) were diagnosed as International Federation of Gyne-
cology and Obstetrics stage I, 4 (5.7%) were diagnosed as stage
II, 26 (37.1%) were diagnosed as stage III, and 13 (18.6%) were
diagnosed as stage IV. Histological subtypes of the tumor
comprised 28 (40.0%) cases of serous, 22 (31.4%) cases of clear
cell, 11 (15.7%) cases of endometrioid, 2 (2.9%) cases of
mucinous, and 7 (10.0%) cases of other types [supporting
information (SI) Table 2].
Toward the end of the study, 29 (41.4%) patients had died of
their disease, and 41 (58.6%) were alive. The mean follow-up
period was 5.19 years (range, 0.07–11.36; SD, 3.0).
PD-Ls Expression and Patient Prognosis. Among 70 tissue samples,
the PD-L1 expression level was scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3 in 8
(11.4%), 14 (20.0%), 36 (51.4%), and 12 (17.1%) cases, respec-
tively (Fig. 1 B–D and SI Table 2). PD-L2 expression was scored
as 0, 1, 2, and 3 in 32 (45.7%), 12 (17.1%), 24 (34.3%), and 2
(2.8%) cases (Fig. 1 F–H). Accordingly, the proportion of high
expression (scores 2 and 3) was 68.6% for PD-L1 and 37.1% for
PD-L2 (Fig. 1 B, C, F, and G and SI Table 2).
The Kaplan–Meier curve and log rank test showed that the
5-year survival rate of patients with high expression of PD-L1
was significantly worse than that with low expression (Figs. 2A
and 3A and SI Table 3) (overall survival rate  SD, low vs. high:
80.2  8.9% vs. 52.6  7.7%, P  0.016; progression-free
survival, low vs. high: 68.2  9.9% vs. 43.5  7.2%, P  0.038).
The overall survival period (years, mean  SD) in the PD-L1 low
vs. high group was 9.56  0.82 vs. 6.48  0.62, and the
progression-free survival period was 6.12  0.72 vs. 5.92  0.99.
The 5-year survival rate in patients with high PD-L2 expres-
sion was worse than in those with low PD-L2 expression;
however, the difference was not statistically significant (Figs. 2B
and 3B and SI Table 3) (overall survival rate  SD, low vs. high:
68.4  7.4% vs. 48.4  10.7%, P  0.111; progression-free
survival, low vs. high: 54.6  7.5% vs. 45.1  9.9%, P  0.685).
The overall survival period (years, mean  SD) of patients with
low vs. high PD-L2 expression was 8.13  1.01 vs. 5.13  0.70,
and the progression-free survival period was 6.12  0.72 vs.
5.92  0.99.
The overall survival rate of patients with low expression of
both PD-L1 and PD-L2 was significantly better than the others,
as shown in Fig. 2C (5-year survival rate of both-low group vs.
both-high group: 86.2% vs. 43.2%, P  0.013; both-low group vs.
either-high group: 86.2% vs. 59.2%, P  0.040). These data
clearly demonstrate the strong inverse correlation between
PD-L1 expression and the prognosis of the patients with ovarian
cancer.

tors. Among the various clinicopathological factors, primary

C.I., 2.17–9.50; P  0.001) were significantly unfavorable factors
in univariate analysis, whereas the age of the patient, histology,
and adjuvant chemotherapy showed no correlation (SI Table 3).
Neither PD-L1 nor PD-L2 expression had any statistically
significant correlation with various clinicopathological factors
such as age, primary tumor status, lymph node metastasis,
distant metastasis, histological type, residual tumor status, and
chemotherapy (SI Table 2).
Multivariate Analysis. Multivariate analysis using the Cox hazard
model revealed that PD-L1 was an independent poor prognostic
factor for both overall and progression-free survival (Table 1;
RR, 4.26; 95% C.I., 1.39–12.94; P  0.011 and RR, 2.57; 95%
C.I., 1.11–5.93; P  0.027), whereas PD-L2 expression was not.
Other factors contributing to overall poor survival (Table 1)
were tumor status (RR, 4.05; 95% C.I., 1.06–15.50; P  0.041),
lymph node metastasis (RR, 2.98; 95% C.I., 1.13–7.83; P 
0.027), and residual tumor status (RR, 8.83; 95% C.I., 2.74–
28.48; P  0.001), whereas other factors contributing to poor
progression-free survival (Table 1) were lymph node metastasis
(RR, 3.37; 95% C.I., 1.59–7.15; P  0.002) and residual tumor
status (RR, 5.99; 95% C.I., 2.92–12.27; P  0.001). Taken
together with the result of univariate analysis, PD-L1 expression
is an independent poor prognostic factor.
Tumor-Infiltrating CD8 T Lymphocyte Count and Prognosis. Tumor-
infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes were evaluated separately first
in cancer cell nests (intraepithelial) and then in cancer stroma
(stromal) (Fig. 1K). Intraepithelial and stromal CD8 T lym-
phocytes were positive in 32 (45.7%) and 29 (41.4%) of the 70
tumors, respectively (Fig. 1 J–L and SI Table 2). The average
numbers of intraepithelial and stromal CD8 T cells were 6.43
(range, 0–56.8; SD, 8.32) and 7.29 (range, 0–60.6; SD, 8.42) per
0.0625 mm2.
The Kaplan–Meier curve and log rank test showed that
patients positive for intraepithelial CD8 T lymphocyte infiltra-
tion had significantly better overall and progression-free survival
than patients negative for intraepithelial CD8 T lymphocyte
infiltration [5-year survival rate  SD, positive vs. negative:
86.9  6.1% vs. 39.0  8.7%, P  0.001 (Fig. 2D and SI Table
3) and 75.0  7.7% vs. 31.6  7.5%, P  0.001 (Fig. 3C)]. The
overall survival period (years, mean  SD) for positive vs.
negative intraepithelial CD8 infiltration was 9.6  0.6 vs. 4.7 
0.5. Progression-free survival in positive vs. negative intraepi-
thelial CD8 infiltration was 8.9  0.8 vs. 3.5  0.6. On the other
hand, stromal CD8 T cells had no significant impact on either
overall or progression-free survival (Figs. 2E and 3D: P  0.616
and P  0.320) (SI Table 3).
Multivariate analysis indicated that intraepithelial CD8 T
lymphocyte count was an independent poor prognostic factor for
both overall and progression-free survival (Table 1) (RR, 7.62;
95% C.I., 2.76–21.08; P  0.001 and RR, 3.75; 95% C.I.,
1.74–8.07; P  0.001, respectively). These data are in agreement
with previous report by others, confirming the contribution of
the immune system in the eradication of ovarian cancers (33–35).
Correlation Between Tumor-Infiltrating CD8 T Lymphocyte Count
and Other Factors, Including PD-Ls Expression. No correlation was
found between intraepithelial CD8 T lymphocyte count and
various clinicopathological factors, suggesting that intraepithe-
lial CD8 T lymphocyte count is an independent prognostic

factor (SI Table 2). In contrast, there was a significant inverse
correlation between intraepithelial CD8 T lymphocyte count
and PD-L1 expression (Fig. 2F) (r  0.266, P  0.026). PD-L2
expression was not associated with intraepithelial CD8 T
lymphocyte count (r  0.025, P  0.835). Stromal CD8 T
lymphocyte count was not correlated with any other factors.
Taken together, it is likely that PD-L1 on tumor cells prohibits
the intraepithelial invasion of tumor-specific CD8 T cells,
resulting in the tumor evasion of the immune system.
Discussion
An appropriate Ab that can be applied to paraffin-embedded
specimens is especially valuable in evaluating historical speci-
mens with known outcome and routinely processed clinical
specimens. Most of the previous reports on PD-Ls expression
were performed by using frozen specimens (25–29, 32). Thomp-
son et al. (30) examined the expression of PD-L1 on paraffin-
embedded specimens of renal cell carcinoma using the same Ab
that they used in the previous study on frozen section and
reported that there was a significant difference in the incidence
of PD-L1 expression between paraffin-embedded and frozen
specimens. In this study we generated a new Ab against human
PD-L1 that strongly recognizes human PD-L1 protein on for-
malin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. Because positive
incidence of PD-L1 expression in our study using this Ab is
similar to the previous report on frozen specimen of ovarian
cancers using other Abs (25), it appears that our Ab adequately
evaluates the expression of PD-L1 on paraffin-embedded spec-
imens and should be useful in the analysis of various cancers.
The frequency of PD-L1 expression is highest among various
malignancies including carcinoma of the lung (50%), esophagus
(44%), stomach (42%), breast (34%), and kidney (37%), sug-
gesting that PD-L1 expression is more prevalent in ovarian
cancer than in other malignancies and may play an important
role in the suppression of host–tumor immunity against highly
immunogenic tumors (26, 28, 32, 36, 37). In contrast, expression
of PD-L2 was less frequent, being found in approximately
one-half of the ovarian cancers. This is the first report of PD-L2
expression in ovarian cancer, and the incidence is similar to that
seen in lung and esophageal cancer (26, 32).
Analysis of PD-Ls expression in correlation with survival re-
vealed that patients with high PD-L1 expression had a significantly
poorer outcome than patients with low/negative expression. Nota-
bly, 2 test revealed no significant correlation between PD-L1
expression and various clinicopathological factors such as clinical
stage and histological subtype of the tumor. Multivariate analysis
also showed that PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic
factor, along with the well established factors including primary
tumor status, lymph node metastasis, and residual tumor. PD-L2
showed a similar tendency to PD-L1, but without statistical signif-
icance. Patients negative for both PD-L1 and PD-L2 had a far better
prognosis than those positive for either or both PD-L1 and PD-L2.
These data suggest that PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue is a novel
independent prognostic factor and possibly reflects the interruption
of the antitumor immunity of the host. High expression of PD-L1
has also been shown to be an independent prognostic factor in renal
cancer and gastric cancer (30, 36). Both PD-L1 and PD-L2 were
reported to be independent prognostic factors in esophageal cancer
(32). In contrast, neither was correlated with prognosis in a report
on lung cancer (26). Therefore, the involvement of PD-L1 and
PD-L2 in the tumor immune escape seems to differ depending on
the organs or tumor types.
PD-Ls on tumor cells are found to suppress the effector
function of CD8 T cells (25, 38). To elucidate whether PD-L1
expression indeed reflects host–tumor immunity, we evaluated
CD8 TILs because the presence of particular TIL subsets has
been shown to correlate with better prognosis in cutaneous
melanoma, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, renal cancer,
and ovarian cancer (5–9, 33–35). Our results clearly support the
findings that intraepithelial CD8 TILs are a strong prognostic

factor in ovarian cancer. In addition, intraepithelial CD8 TILs
predict not only overall survival but also progression-free sur-
vival of patients with ovarian cancer, which was not clear in
former studies. Moreover, CD8 TILs are not associated with
known clinicopathological factors such as tumor stage. Thus, the
number of intraepithelial CD8 TILs is a significant prognostic
parameter predicting the clinical course of ovarian cancer irre-
spective of other conventional parameters.
We found a significant inverse correlation between tumor PD-L1
expression and intraepithelial CD8 TIL count (correlation index,
0.266, P  0.026) (Fig. 2F), whereas PD-L2 expression was not
significantly correlated with CD8 TIL count. These results con-
trast with a previous report on esophageal cancer, in which inverse
correlation was observed between CD8 TIL count and PD-L2 but
not PD-L1 expression (32). This discrepancy may reflect the
differential involvement of PD-L1 and PD-L2 depending on organs
or cancer types. Correlation between tumor PD-L1 expression and
intraepithelial CD8 TIL count indicates that tumor PD-L1 ex-
pression is indeed relevant to host–tumor immunity and thus
reflects patient outcome. However, the reduction of CD8 TILs
may not be the only mechanism by which PD-L1 promotes tumor
immune escape because their correlation is not so strong. It may be
possible that PD-L1 on tumor cells induces functional impairment
of tumor-specific T cells without reducing their number as reported
for antiviral T cells (39, 40).
Taken together, our data indicate that PD-L1 expression by
tumor cells is a significant prognostic factor in ovarian cancer
and is inversely correlated with intraepithelial CD8 TIL count,
a known immunological prognostic indicator. Both PD-L1 ex-
pression and CD8 TIL count are independent factors among
the established prognostic factors, suggesting that immunologi-
cal status is not adequately evaluated by the conventional
clinicopathological prognostic factors. Examination of the
PD-L1 expression on tumor cells can be an appropriate method
of evaluating host–tumor immunity that is fundamental for the
better management of ovarian cancer.
Finally, current findings indicate that most ovarian cancers
evade the host immune system and accelerate tumor growth by
expressing PD-L1, suggesting that the PD-1/PD-L pathway may
be a potential target for immunotherapy of ovarian cancer.
Indeed, PD-1/PD-L blockade has been shown to facilitate tumor
eradication in various experimental systems including Ab block-
ade of PD-1 or PD-L1, expression of the extracellular region of
PD-1 by local gene therapy, and PD-1-deficient mice (27, 31, 38,
41). PD-1 blockade has also been shown to suppress tumor
metastasis in melanoma and colon cancer cell lines in mice (42).
The clinical efficacy of PD-1 blockers may appropriately be
evaluated in ovarian cancer patients.
Materials and Methods
Patients and Samples. The subjects for the present study were a
consecutive series of 70 women who had been diagnosed with
and undergone primary operation for ovarian cancer at the
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Kyoto University
Hospital (Kyoto, Japan) between 1993 and 2001. The relevant
clinical data were collected by retrospective review of the
patients’ files. Patients with nonepithelial-type neoplasia, pa-
tients treated before operation, and patients who were not
treated surgically were excluded. Borderline tumors of the ovary
were also excluded from this study. The patients provided
written informed consent under the approval of the Ethics
Committee of Kyoto University Hospital.
Immunohistochemistry. We generated monoclonal Abs specific for
human PD-L1 that can detect PD-L1 on formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded specimens by a standard protocol. Briefly, BALB/c
mice were immunized with a recombinant human PD-L1 extra-
cellular domain (A18 to T239), which was expressed in Esche-
richia coli, refolded in arginine-based buffer with a glutathione
redox system, and purified by consecutive column chromatog-
raphies on Q Sepharose HP and Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare
Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). The animals were killed, and the
splenocytes were fused with SP2/0. We obtained 48 hybridomas
that produced Abs specific for human PD-L1 on flow cytometry
analysis, one of which, 27A2, was used for immunohistochemical
staining in this study.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed by the strepta-
vidin–biotin–peroxidase method. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded specimens were cut into 4-m-thick sections. The tissue
sections were deparaffinized in xylene (3  10 min) and dehydrated
through graded alcohols (99%, 99%, and 70%) to water. Antigens
were retrieved by the following methods. For PD-L1 staining, the
samples were boiled in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) by microwaves. For
CD8 staining, the samples were heated in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH
9.0) at 95°C for 40 min. To block endogenous peroxidase activity,
all of the sections were treated with 100% methanol containing
0.3% H2O2 for 15 min. Nonspecific binding of IgG was blocked by
using normal rabbit serum (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). The sections
were incubated with mouse anti-PD-L1 monoclonal Abs (clone
27A2), goat anti-PD-L2 polyclonal Abs (R & D Systems, Minne-
apolis, MN), and mouse anti-CD8 monoclonal Abs (Nichirei;
clone C8/144B) overnight at 4°C. Then, they were incubated with
biotinylated rabbit-anti-mouse secondary Abs (Nichirei) for PD-L1
and CD8 stainings and with biotinylated rabbit-anti-goat second-
ary Abs for PD-L1 staining, followed by the incubation with
streptavidin–peroxidase complex solution for 30 min. Signals were
generated by incubation with 3,3-diaminobenzidine. Finally, the
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and observed under
the microscope.
Evaluation of the Specimens. Two independent gynecological
pathologists examined the immunohistochemical slides with-
out any prior information on the clinical history of the patients.
The expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 was evaluated according
to the intensity of the staining and scored as follows: 0,
negative; 1, very weak expression; 2, moderate expression but
weaker than placenta (PD-L1) and tonsil (PD-L2); and 3,
equivalent to or stronger expression than placenta or tonsil.
Cases with scores 0 and 1 were defined as the low-expression
group, and cases with scores 2 and 3 were the high-expression
group.
CD8 staining was evaluated according to the previous
reports (33, 35). Briefly, tumor-infiltrating CD8 T lympho-
cytes were counted separately by their localization as intra-
epithelial or stromal. CD8 T lymphocytes infiltrating into
cancer cell nests, designated intraepithelial CD8 T lympho-
cytes, were counted with a microscopic field at 200 (0.0625
mm2). Three areas with the most abundant infiltration were
selected, and the average count was calculated. The result was
interpreted as negative when fewer than five cells per 0.0625
mm2 and as positive when more than or equal to five cells per
0.0625 mm2. CD8 T lymphocytes detected within the cancer
stroma, designated stromal CD8 T lymphocytes, were eval-
uated in the same way.
Statistical Analysis. Fisher’s exact test and the 2 test were used
to analyze the associations between PD-Ls expression and
tumor-infiltrating CD8 T lymphocyte count and various
clinicopathological factors. Comparisons of tumor-infiltrating
CD8 T lymphocyte counts were carried out by using Student’s
t test and ANOVA. Spearman’s coefficient rank test was used
to evaluate the correlation between PD-Ls expression and
tumor-infiltrating CD8 T lymphocyte count. Univariate anal-
ysis for overall and progression-free survival was performed
and evaluated with the log rank test, and Kaplan–Meier curves
were generated. A multivariate Cox proportional-hazard

model was used to evaluate the independency of PD-Ls
expression and tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cell count as prog-
nostic factors among other variables such as pTNM stage,
histology, residual tumor state, and adjuvant chemotherapy.
All P values 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
