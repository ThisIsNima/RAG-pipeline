children and adolescents: systematic review of controlled
trials

ABSTRACT
Objective To review the published literature on the
effectiveness of interventions to promote physical activity
in children and adolescents.
Design Systematic review.
Data sources Literature search using PubMed, SCOPUS,
Psychlit, Ovid Medline, Sportdiscus, and Embase up to
December 2006.
Review methods Two independent reviewers assessed
studies against the following inclusion criteria: controlled
trial, comparison of intervention to promote physical
activity with no intervention control condition,
participants younger than 18 years, and reported
statistical analyses of a physical activity outcome
measure. Levels of evidence, accounting for
methodological quality, were assessed for three types of
intervention, five settings, and three target populations.
Results The literature search identified 57 studies: 33
aimed at children and 24 at adolescents. Twenty four
studies were of high methodological quality, including 13
studies in children. Interventions that were found to be
effective achieved increases ranging from an additional 2.
6 minutes of physical education related physical activity
to 283 minutes per week of overall physical activity.
Among children, limited evidence for an effect was found
for interventions targeting children from low
socioeconomic populations, and environmental
interventions. Strong evidence was found that school
based interventions with involvement of the family or
community and multicomponent interventions can
increase physical activity in adolescents.
Conclusion Some evidence was found for potentially
effective strategies to increase children’s levels of
physical activity. For adolescents, multicomponent
interventions and interventions that included both school
and family or community involvement have the potential
to make important differences to levels of physical activity
and should be promoted. A lack of high quality
evaluations hampers conclusions concerning
effectiveness, especially among children.
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of childhood obesity and related
health problems is increasing in many Western coun-
tries and is anticipated to continue to increase.1
Evidence of an association between physical activity
and weight gain remains sparse.2 Nevertheless, in an
effort to halt or reverse trends in obesity, promotion
of physical activity in children and adolescents has
been identified as a key focus of efforts to promote
health.3-5 Physical activity among children and adoles-
cents is believed to be insufficient,6-8 and low levels of
activity seem to persist into adulthood.9 10 This makes
physical inactivity among young people a risk factor
for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis
in later life.11 The development and evaluation of inter-
ventions to promote physical activity in young people
is therefore a priority.
It is unclear how successful efforts have been to
increase the activity levels of young people. Recently
published reviews have mostly dealt with the preven-
tion
of
obesity2 12-14
or
included
only
adult
populations.15-17 Previous attempts to summarise the
evidence in young people were mostly narrative,18-20
did not assess the effects on children and adolescents
separately,19-21 and did not assess the methodological
quality of the studies.18-22 In addition these reviews
have included studies without a no intervention con-
trol group18-21 and studies in which the promotion of
physical activity was only a small part of an overall
health promotion programme.18-22 We systematically
reviewed the evidence on promotion of physical activ-
ity in children and adolescents.
METHODS
We carried out a literature search of papers on inter-
ventions to promote physical activity in young people
using six electronic databases (Pubmed, Psychlit,
SCOPUS, Ovid Medline, Sportdiscus, and Embase)
from the year of their inception up to and including
December 2006. The search strategy focused on four
key elements: population (for example, youth, chil-
dren), study design (for example, controlled trial, ran-
dom), behaviour (for example, physical activity,
walking, exercise), and intervention (for example,
health education, behaviour change). (The full list of
terms is available at www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/Publica
tions/Supplementary_Material/VanSluijsBMJ2007/.)
We also carried out a citation search of included papers
and published relevant reviews.2 12-14 18 19 21-30 Native

guage papers.
Inclusion criteria
We restricted the review to published trials, applying
the following inclusion criteria: children and adoles-
cents (≤18 years), not selected on the basis of having a
specific disease or health problem; interventions in
which the main component or one of the components
was aimed at promotion of physical activity through
behaviour change in any setting (we excluded inter-
ventions to reduce sedentary behaviour, or structured
exercise programmes to prevent obesity); inclusion of
a non-physical activity intervention for the control
group; and reported statistical analyses of an outcome
measure related to physical activity (self reported or
objectively measured).
Two reviewers (EMFvS, AMMcM) independently
reviewed the results from the initial search of the title
then the abstract and finally the full paper. When opi-
nions differed consensus was reached through discus-
sion.
Assessment of methodological quality
We assessed methodological quality using a 10 item
quality assessment scale derived from previously
used quality criteria13 16 29 31 and we focused on internal
validity and analyses (table 1). Two reviewers (EMFvS,
AMMcM) independently assessed for each study
whether its score on an item was “positive,” “negative,”
or “not, or insufficiently, described.” In cases of dis-
agreement, consensus was reached by discussion. We
accumulated the positive scores and defined quality as
high when a randomised controlled trial scored six or
more or a controlled trial scored five or more. We ana-
lysed the level of agreement between the two reviewers
using Cohen’s κ, with agreement assessed on a dichot-
omous scale (negative and not described versus posi-
tive).
Data extraction
Data extraction on to standardised forms was under-
taken separately for studies including children
(<12 years, AMMcM) and adolescents (≥12 years,
EMFvS). We included interventions in high schools
and American middle schools (6th to 8th grade, ages
11 to 14) in the adolescent category. Data extracted
included project title, country, study design, inclusion
criteria, baseline descriptive data, randomisation pro-
cedure, descriptions of intervention and control con-
ditions, length of follow-up, losses to follow-up,
selective drop out (observed differences between
drop outs and study completers), physical activity
measures used, secondary outcome measures, and
results.
In
addition
both
reviewers
(EMFvS,
AMMcM) extracted information on the specifics of
the intervention (setting, target population, and inter-
vention type), size of the baseline sample, and the
overall effectiveness ofthe study for the main physical
activity outcome measure (a measure of individual
physical activity was used when available). We scored
the size of the study as positive if there were morethan
250 participants or if a power calculation was pro-
vided justifying the sample size (large) and as negative
if there were 250 or fewer participants (small).
Studies used a wide range of methods to assess
effectiveness and reported a variety of different out-
come measures. We considered devising a common
outcome metric for interpretational purposes, similar
to a previous review focusing on interventions pro-
moting
one
particular
behaviour,
walking.32
Although the studies included in this review assessed
walking in different ways, it is a relatively homoge-
neous behaviour. In contrast, physical activity is
more complex and consists of various domains, mak-
ing it difficult to compare the results of the various
measures used to assess this behaviour or particular
sub-domains (for example, during breaks, out of
school). Consequently because of the heterogeneity
of the behaviour of interest and the outcome mea-
sures used we decided that calculating one common

measure of outcome would not be valid or informa-
tive. Alternatively we used scores to indicate effec-
tiveness—that is, whether there was no difference in
effect between control and intervention group (0
score), a positive or negative trend (+ or −), or a sta-
tistically significant difference (P<0.05) in favour of
the intervention or control group (++ or –, respec-
tively). In cases of disagreement, consensus was
reached by discussion.
Strength of the evidence
We thought a formal meta-analysis inappropriate
owing to the heterogeneity of the interventions, set-
tings,participants,andoutcomemeasures.Insteadwe
used a rating system of levels of evidence to draw con-
clusions on effectiveness, based on previously used
best evidence syntheses.16 31 We defined five levels
on the basis of study design, methodological quality,
and sample size: strong, moderate, limited, inconclu-
sive, or no evidence for effect (see www.mrc-epid.
cam.ac.uk/Publications/Supplementary_Material/
VanSluijsBMJ2007/), and conclusions were drawn
on the basis of the consistency of results of studies
with the highest available level of quality. If at least
two thirds (66.6%) of the relevant studies were
reported to have significant results in the same direc-
tion then we considered the overall results to be con-
sistent. In a stratified analysis we assessed levels of
evidence for studies according to setting, target popu-
lation, and type of intervention (educational only,
environmentalorpolicybasedonly,oracombination
of both, “multicomponent”).
RESULTS
Overall, 3045 references were retrieved from the
database
search
(PubMed,
n=2000;
Psychinfo,
n=340; Scopus, n=692; Ovid Medline, n=591; Sport-
discus, n=472; Embase, n=400). Fifty one studies met
the inclusion criteria, a further six were added after
searching the citations (figure). Thirty three included
childrenw1-w47 and 24 included adolescents.w48-w77
Tables 2 and 3 show the characteristics of the studies.
Methodological quality
Agreement was 85.9% on the 570 items scored during
the quality assessment (κ=0.72, substantial agree-
ment); full consensus was reached after discussion.
Overall 24 studies (42%) exhibited high methodolo-
gical quality, of which 15 (25%) had more than 250
participants (see www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/Publica
tions/Supplementary_Material/VanSluijsBMJ2007/
). Most studies applied intention to treat analyses and
measured all study groups at similar times, but only
10 studies (18%) had a follow-up of six months or
longer. Insufficient information was provided to
score the adequacy of the randomisation procedure
for 34 studies (60%), and 33 studies (58%) lacked
information on allocation concealment at outcome
assessment.
Study characteristics
Eighteen of the 33 studies in children were carried out
in the United States, seven in the United Kingdom,
and the remainder in other countries. Most of the
child studies (82%) evaluated school based inter-
ventions,14ofwhichincludedacommunityorfamily
component. Around half of the child interventions
were educational whereas a third used a multicompo-
nent approach. Just over half of the studies relied on
child reported or parent reported questionnaires or
diaries as the main measure of physical activity (see
www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/Publications/Supplemen
tary_Material/VanSluijsBMJ2007/). Twelve studies
used an objective measure of physical activity
whereas three used observation methods. Only five
of these assessed overall physical activity; the remain-
der mostly assessed activity during physical educa-
tion or playtime. Nineteen of the studies assessed
overall physical activity, eight measured school
based physical activity only, and six assessed out of
school physical activity.
Eighteen of the 24 studies in adolescents were car-
ried out inthe UnitedStatesandsix inothercountries.
Almost all evaluated school based interventions, six
of which included involvement of the family or com-
munity. Five studies included a follow-up measure-
ment of six months or more (see www.mrc-epid.
cam.ac.uk/Publications/Supplementary_Material/
VanSluijsBMJ2007/).
Measurement
of
physical
activity was mostly focused on non-school related
activities and carried out with self reported question-
naire or recall instruments. Four studies used an
objective measure as the main measure of physical
activity, all assessing total physical activity, and one
study used direct observation to assess physical edu-
cation related physical activity.
Evidence of effect on physical activity
Thirty eight studies reported a positive intervention
effect (67%), achieving statistical significance in 27
(47%). This included 14 studies in children (42%)
and 13 in adolescents (54%). Significant results ran-
ged from an increase of 2.6 minutes during physical
education classes to a 42% increase in participation in
regularphysicalactivityandanincreaseof83minutes
per week in moderate to vigorous physical activity.
Table 4 summarises the stratified levels of evidence
for the effectiveness of interventions to promote phy-
sical activity in children and adolescents.
Intervention types in children
Nineteen studies evaluated education only inter-
ventions, including one large high quality rando-
mised controlled trial,w11 two large high quality
controlled trials,w3 w4 four small high quality rando-
mised controlled trials,w15-w17 w23 and seven low qual-
ity randomised controlled trials.w1 w2 w8 w10 w19-w21 Four
of these reported a statistically significant inter-
vention effect, therefore no overall evidence of an
effect of education only interventions was identified.

environment, including two low quality randomised
controlled trials.w24 w26 Both of these reported a signif-
icant intervention effect, providing limited evidence
of an effect of environmental interventions.
Ten studies evaluated multicomponent inter-
ventions in children, including three large high qual-
ity randomised controlled trials.w29 w39 w44 Only one of
these high quality trials reported a significant positive
effect, equating to inconclusive evidence of effective-
ness.
Intervention types in adolescents
Seventeen studies evaluated education only inter-
ventions in adolescents, including four large high
quality randomised controlled trials.w48 w58 w60 w63 No
evidence of an effect was found, with only one of the
large high quality trials reporting statistically signifi-
cant positive results. Only one study, a low quality
randomised controlled trial,w67 evaluated the effect
of an environmental intervention, providing incon-
clusive evidence of an effect.
Six
studies
evaluated
multicomponent
inter-
ventions, all in the school setting. Three were large
high quality randomised controlled trials,w69 w72 w76
which all showed significant positive results, provid-
ing strong evidence of an effect of multicomponent
interventions.
Settings in studies of children
Twenty seven studies evaluated school based inter-
ventions. Thirteen of these were restricted to the
school setting only, including five randomised con-
trolled trials, one of high qualityw39 and four of lower
quality.w8 w21 w24 w26 Three of these randomised con-
trolled trials reportedsignificant positive intervention
effects, resulting in the classification of inconclusive
evidenceofaneffectofschoolonlyinterventions.The
other 14 school based interventions also included
family
or
community
components,
such
as
homework assignments to do with parents or incor-
poration of physical activity into existing community
events. Two large high quality randomised controlled
trials were identified,w29 w44 one of which showed a
significant positive intervention effect, suggesting
inconclusive evidence of an effect.
Four studies evaluated family based interventions,
including three small high quality randomised con-
trolled trials.w16 w17 w23 Only one reported a significant
effect, which favoured the control group. One large
high quality randomised controlled trialw11 and one
small high quality randomised controlled trialw15
evaluated the effect of a community based inter-
vention, and neither reported a positive intervention
effect. This review therefore provides no evidence of
an effect of either family based or community based
interventions among children.
Settings in studies of adolescents
Of the 20 studies that evaluated school based inter-
ventions, 14 were restricted to the school setting,
including two large high quality randomised con-
trolled trials,w58 w60 one of which reported a statisti-
cally
significant
intervention
effect.w58
This
represents inconclusive evidence of an effect. Six stu-
dies evaluated school based interventions also includ-
ing family or community involvement, three of which
were large high quality randomised controlled
trials.w69 w72 w76 Two of these large high quality trials
showed statistically significant positive results sug-
gesting strong evidence of an effect of school based
interventions including family or community invol-
vement.
The only study evaluating a family based inter-
vention, a high quality randomised controlled
trial,w63 did not report a positive effect, as did the

primary care based interventionsw49 w57 showed a sig-
nificant positive effect. Consequently evidence of an
effect of either family based, community based, or
primary care based interventions in adolescents is
inconclusive.
Target populations in children
Five studies evaluated interventions targeted specifi-
cally at girls: one large high quality randomised con-
trolled trial,w11 two small high quality randomised
controlled trials,w15 w16 and two low quality rando-
mised controlled trials.w8 w19 Four reported positive
effects but only one was significant. Ten studies eval-
uated interventions specifically aimed at ethnic min-
ority groups, including four small high quality
randomised controlled trialsw15-w17 w23 and four low
quality
randomised
controlled
trials.w2 w10 w19 w33
Only one low quality randomised controlled trial
reported a significant positive effect. Therefore no
overall evidence of an effect for interventions target-
ing girls or ethnic minority groups was found. Three
controlled trials, including two of high quality,w3 w28
assessed the effect of interventions targeting children
from low socioeconomic backgrounds. All reported a
significant positive effect, resulting in a classification
oflimitedevidenceofaneffectfortheseinterventions.
Target populations in adolescents
Eight studies evaluated interventions specifically
aimed at adolescent girls and one aimed at boys.
Three were large high quality randomised controlled
trials,w48 w69 w72 of which one showed significant posi-
tive results. In two small high quality studies—one
randomised controlled trialw50 and one controlled
trialw54—interventions were aimed at low socioeco-
nomic groups, with only one reporting a significant
intervention effect. Consequently evidence of an
effect of interventions targeting adolescents of one
sex or from low socioeconomic groups is inconclu-
sive.
DISCUSSION
We found that in children there is limited evidence of
an effect of interventions targeting low socioeco-
nomic populations and environmental interventions
and the evidence of an effect for multicomponent
interventions and the two types of school based inter-
ventions is inconclusive. More adequately powered
high quality research is needed to strengthen and con-
firm these results. In general, interventions achieved
important changes, such as a 13% increase in play
time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity.
No evidence of effectiveness was observed in six of
the intervention categories. This review especially
raises questions about the usefulness of targeting
interventions at children from ethnic minority popu-
lations or carrying out family based or community
based interventions, as most of the studies identified
did not report positive results. Before pursuing these
strategies further, it is necessary to identify and learn
from the limitations of these interventions and their
evaluations. In addition, no evidence of an effect was
found for educational interventions and the inter-
ventions targeting females, despite more than 67%
of studies evaluating these interventions reporting
positive effects. Most of these were low quality studies
and did not always achieve statistical significance.
Overall there was more evidence for an effect of
interventions among adolescents than among chil-
dren. However, more studies in adolescents com-
pared with studies in children were of high quality
and included a large sample size (33% v 21%). Ado-
lescents are also known to be less active than
children33 34 so may exhibit greater potential for
change. Effects ranged from increases of three min-
utes during physical education to a 50% increase in
the number of participants being regularly active.
Strong evidence was found for the effectiveness of
school based interventions including family or com-
munity involvement and multicomponent inter-
ventions. No evidence of an effect was observed for
educational interventions although an overall posi-
tive trend was observed. This trend is, however,
mainly due to the results of studies with lower meth-
odological quality and should therefore be inter-
preted
with
caution.
This
review
also
shows
inconclusive evidence of an effect in adolescents in
other categories, warranting further investigation.
Intervention approaches
Almosta third ofthe includedstudiesinchildren were
targeted at minority ethnic groups, although the evi-
dence on the association between ethnicity and phy-
sical activity in children is fairly inconsistent.35 36 In
contrast an association has often been reported in
adolescents, with levels of physical activity tending
to be lower in non-white ethnic groups,35 37-39 yet no
interventions targeting adolescents from minority
ethnic groups were identified. Low socioeconomic
status has been identified as a possible determinant
of physical inactivity.40-43 Recently, trials of inter-
ventions targeting socially disadvantaged people

provided some evidence of the potential of this strat-
egy. A higher level of activity in males compared with
females is consistently observed throughout child-
hood and adolescence and evidence also suggests
that both sexes tend to become less active with
increasing age.33 35 This review raises doubts about
whether targeting females and males separately is an
effective approach, although a positive trend was
observed among children. Most of the studies inves-
tigating differential response by sex did not find one,
casting more doubt on the need for separate
approaches for the sexes.
Parental factors and the home environment are
believed to influence physical activity,44 45 yet few
interventions were specifically aimed at the home
and those that have been carried out did not show
significant positive results. An increasing number of
school based interventions do, however, include
some parental involvement, although usually limited
to newsletters and homework assignments. Evidence
of effectiveness of these interventions in adolescents
was strong, although in children the evidence is still
inconclusive. Whether the strategy of involving par-
ents in interventions will be as effective for children
should be the focus of future research.
Theconclusionofstrongevidenceofeffectofmulti-
component interventions in adolescents and the lim-
ited evidence of effect of environmental interventions
in children is in keeping with the ecological approach
to behaviour change as advocated in recent years.46-49
The environmental or policy element of multicompo-
nent interventions mostly consisted of alterations to
the physical education programme, such as addi-
tional classes, physical education teacher training, or
the availability of additional equipment. Observa-
tions of physical activity during physical education
classes mostly showed some increases, but few effects
were observed in overall physical activity. This raises
the question of whether children might compensate
during the rest of the day. It is therefore important to
use objective measures to assess the overall effect of
the intervention on total activity levels.
Young children’s activity is typically intermittent34
in contrast to that of adolescents, which is more struc-
tured and planned. Although traditional cognitive
approaches, potentially combined with environmen-
tal approaches, may increase activity among adoles-
cents and older children (≥10 years), more structural
environmental or policy changes might be needed to
change
younger
children’s
physical
activity
behaviour.50 This is supported by the evidence of an
effect of environmental interventions, which tended
to be evaluated in children in the lower grades (grades
1-4) at primary school. Few studies, however,
included preschool aged children.
Implementation of interventions
Factors that may have limited effectiveness are the
levels of exposure to the intervention and adherence.
Several papers reported problems in these areas. For
example, Pate et alw37 described that only 5% of
participants attended at least half of the sessions
offered.Mostpapers,however,didnotdescribeatten-
dance, implementation, or quality assurance of the
intervention, making it impossible to assess the
impact these factors may have had on the overall find-
ings.
Most of the studies included in this review were
carried out in the United States, raising questions
about the generalisability of these results to other
countries. Feasibility and effectiveness of cross
national implementation is potentially limited owing
to known differences in infrastructure, school sys-
tems, environments, and social norms. To assess the
usefulness of these strategies across different cultures
we would advocate replicating evaluations of pre-
viously successful interventions adapted to a specific
country.
Methodological quality
Various limitations in study design and subsequent
reporting were identified. In particular, information
was lacking on the randomisation procedure and
blinding at outcome assessment, limiting the inter-
pretationof the methodologicalquality. Brief descrip-
tions of interventions hampered stratification of the
studies and analyses of potential effective compo-
nents. Overall, methodological limitations across
the studies included short duration of follow-up,
inadequate adjustment for potential confounders,
and a lack of adjustment for clustering when rando-
misation was carried out at group level. Another lim-
itationwas thelackofprecisionofthephysicalactivity
outcomemeasures.Eighteenofthe studiesinchildren
used self reported or parent reported measures (55%),
just over half of which were not reported to be pre-
viously validated, possibly limiting responsiveness.
Studies using observation or objective measures of
physical activity were in fact more likely to report
significant positive results than studies with a self
reported measure, both in children and in adoles-
cents.
Conclusion
Various policy documents have called for the devel-
opment of effective strategies to increase physical
activity in children and adolescents to help halt or
reverse the increase in obesity and to improve other
aspects of health.4 11 51 52 Based on the published evi-
dence to date it seems that a multilevel approach to
promoting physical activity, combining school based
interventions with family or community involvement
and educational interventions with policy and envir-
onmental changes, is likely to be effective among ado-
lescents and should be promoted. For children, there
is limited evidence of an effect for environmental
interventions and interventions targeting those from
low socioeconomic groups. Research should focus on
filling the gaps identified in this review, such as the
lack of studies among adolescent ethnic minority
populations and preschool children, and of inter-
ventions outside the school setting. Furthermore,

future studies should aim to strengthen the evidence
with rigorous design, appropriate sample size, follow-
up beyond post intervention to assess maintenance,
use of objective measures of overall activity, and
assessment of factors along the causal pathway.53 54
Moreover, studies should include assessment of
implementation issues and carry out cost effective-
ness analyses to further inform future public health
strategies in this topic.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Children and adolescents are believed to have low levels of physical activity, which is
associated with obesity and other health problems
It is unclear what strategies might be effective to promote physical activity
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Multicomponent interventions and interventions including school and family or community
involvement may make important differences in physical activity levels in adolescents
For children some evidence of effect was shown for environmental interventions and those
targeted at children from low socioeconomic backgrounds
