ABSTRACT
ObjectiveTo examinetheeffectofa comprehensive warm-
up programme designed to reduce the risk of injuries in
female youth football.
Design Cluster randomised controlled trial with clubs as
the unit of randomisation.
Setting 125 football clubs from the south, east, and
middle of Norway (65 clusters in the intervention group;
60 in the control group) followed for one league season
(eight months).
Participants 1892 female players aged 13-17 (1055
players in the intervention group; 837 players in the
control group).
Intervention A comprehensive warm-up programme to
improve strength, awareness, and neuromuscular control
during static and dynamic movements.
Main outcome measure Injuries to the lower extremity
(foot, ankle, lower leg, knee, thigh, groin, and hip).
Results During one season, 264 players had relevant
injuries: 121 players in the intervention group and 143 in
the control group (rate ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval
0.49 to 1.03). In the intervention group there was a
significantly lower risk of injuries overall (0.68, 0.48 to
0.98), overuse injuries (0.47, 0.26 to 0.85), and severe
injuries (0.55, 0.36 to 0.83).
Conclusion Though the primary outcome of reduction in
lowerextremityinjurydidnotreachsignificance,theriskof
severe injuries, overuse injuries, and injuries overall was
reduced. This indicates that a structured warm-up
programme can prevent injuries in young female football
players.
Trial registration ISRCTN10306290.
INTRODUCTION
Football (soccer) is the most popular team sport in the
world. There are already more than 265 million
registered players, and the number of participants is
continuing to grow.1 In particular, the number of
women players is increasing rapidly.1 Playing football,
however, entails a substantial risk of injury, and studies
on elite and non-elite female footballers have reported
rates of injury similar to those in men,2-11 the most
common being injuries to the knee and ankle ligament
and thigh muscle strains.2-9 11 12 Women might even be
at greater risk of serious injury than men; the rate of
anterior cruciate ligament injuries is three to five times
higher for girls than for boys.13 14
The high injury rate among football players in
general and female players in particular constitutes a
considerable problem for the player, the club, and—
given the popularity of the sport—for society at large.
Health consequences are seen not just in the short term
but also in the dramatic increase in the risk of early
osteoarthritis.15-17 Despite the urgent need to develop
programmes to prevent knee and ankle injuries in
footballers, there exist only a few small or non-
randomised studies on prevention of injury in female
football players.18-20
Inarecentrandomisedcontrolledtrial,weexamined
the effect of a structured training programme (“The
11”)21 over one season among 2000 female players
aged 13-17.22 The intervention consisted of exercises
focusing on core stability, balance, dynamic stabilisa-
tion, and eccentric hamstring strength. We found no
difference in the injury risk between the intervention
group and control group, though the study was limited
by low compliance among the intervention teams.
This led us to develop an exercise programme to
improve both the preventive effect of the programme
and the compliance of coaches and players. The
revised programme (“The 11+”) included key exer-
cises and additional exercises to provide variation and
progression. It also included a new set of structured
running exercises that made it better suited as a
comprehensive warm-up programme for training and
matches.
We conducted a randomised controlled trial to
examinetheeffectoftherevisedprogrammeonratesof
lower extremity injury in young female footballers. To
minimise contamination bias within clubs, we used a
cluster randomised design.

METHODS
We randomised 125 clubs who agreed to participate in
the study to the intervention or control group. All
teams from one club were randomised to the same
treatment arm. Five clubs included two teams each.
The statistician (IH) who conducted the randomisation
did not take part in the intervention. Box 1 provides
details of the procedure used to recruit clubs.
We informed clubs allocated to the intervention
group that they would receive a programme of warm-
up exercises used to prevent injuries and enhance
performance. We asked the clubs in the control group
to warm up as usual during the season and informed
them that, if the intervention programme prevented
injuries,theywouldreceivethesameprogrammeasthe
intervention group in the subsequent season.
Intervention
An expert group convened by the international foot-
ball federation (FIFA), with representatives from the
Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center, the Santa
Monica Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Research
Foundation, and the FIFA Medical Assessment and
ResearchCentre,developedthe warm-up programme.
Before the start of the study one club tested the
programme. It consisted of three parts (table 1). The
initial part was running exercises at slow speed
combined with active stretching and controlled con-
tacts with a partner. The running course included six to
tenpairsofcones(dependingonthenumberofplayers)
about five to six metres apart (length and width). The
second part consisted of six different sets of exercises;
these included strength (fig 1), balance, and jumping
exercises,eachwith threelevelsofincreasingdifficulty.
The final part was speed running combined with
football specific movements with sudden changes in
direction.
At the start of the pre-season, February to mid-April
2007,weinvitedthecoachesandteamcaptainsfromall
clubs in the intervention group to a three hour
instructional course in which we introduced the
warm-upprogramme.InstructorsfromtheOsloSports
Trauma Research Centre arranged courses at different
locations in each of the eight regional districts. The
instructors had been familiarised with the programme
during a seminar, where they received theoretical and
practical training in the programme and instruction in
how to teach the exercises to the coaches and team
captains.
ThecoachesreceivedaninstructionalDVDshowing
all of the exercises in the programme, a loose leaf
exercise book, and small exercise cards attached to a
neck strap. In addition, the coaches and every player
received a poster explaining every exercise. The
information material detailed each exercise and
explained the proper form for each, as well as common
biomechanical mistakes. It also described the princi-
ples of progression in the exercise prescription. We
asked the coaches to use the complete exercise

programme as the warm up for every training session
throughout the season and to use the running exercises
in the programme as part of their warm up for every
match.
When introducing the programme to the clubs, our
main focus was to improve awareness and neuromus-
cular control during standing, running, planting,
cutting, jumping, and landing. We encouraged the
players to concentrate on the quality of their move-
ments and put emphasis on core stability, hip control,
and proper knee alignment to avoid excessive knee
valgus during both static and dynamic movements
(fig 2). We asked the coaches and the players to watch
each other closely and give feedback during training.
Once players were familiar with the exercises the
programme took about 20 minutes to complete.
Throughout the season, researchers contacted the
coaches regularly by email and telephone; this allowed
the coaches to ask questions and provide feedback with
respect to the warm-up programme and injury and
exposure registration. It also helped us to identify clubs
that were not complying with the protocol or where
additional motivational measures, such as site visits,
were needed to increase compliance. Clubs in both
groups were offered an incentive in the form of high
quality footballs, provided they completed data
registration throughout the study period. Despite
these measures, 13 clubs in the intervention group
did not start the warm-up programme nor did they
deliver any data on injury or exposure (fig 3). Nineteen
clubs in the control group did not provide any data.
Outcome measures
We defined the primary outcome as an injury to the
lower extremity (foot, ankle, lower leg, knee, thigh,
groin, and hip) and secondary outcomes as any injury,
or an injury to the ankle, knee, or other body parts. We
included all injuries reported after an intervention club
had completed the first prevention training session
(matched with the same date in a control club) to
compare the risk of injury between the groups.
Exposure and injury registration
The coaches reported injuries and details of an
individual player’s participation for each training
session and match, as well as to what extent the
warm-up programme was carried out each session
(intervention clubs) on weekly registration forms
throughout the study period. These were submitted
by email, mail, or fax to the research centre. Data on
players who dropped out during the study period were
included for the entire period of their participation.
At the research centre one physical therapist and one
medical student,who were blindedto groupallocation,
recorded injuries. They were given specific training on
the protocols for injury classification and injury
definitions (box 2) before the start of the injury
registrationperiod.Everyinjuredplayerwascontacted
to assess aspects of the injury based on a standardised
injury questionnaire.23 In most cases, players were
contacted within four weeks (range one day to five
months)aftertheinjury.Box 2showsthedefinitionswe
used to register injuries. These are in accordance with
the consensus statement on injury definitions and data
collection procedures.24
Sample size
We calculated our sample size on the basis of data on
incidence of injury in young female footballers in
Norway during the 2005 season.22 We estimated that
16% would incur an injury to the lower extremities and
about 10-12% would injure a knee or ankle during one
season. Given an estimated inflation factor for cluster
effects because of randomisation by clubs of 1.8,22 900
players in each group would provide an acceptable
power of 0.86 at the 5% significance level to detect a
40% reduction in the number of players with a lower
extremity injury. Our model was based on 18 players

per club and a dropout rate of 15%, which means that
we needed to include about 120 clubs with 2150
players.
Statistical methods
We conducted all statistical analyses according to a
prespecified plan using Stata, version 10.0 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX). We used the rate ratio of the risk
of injury according to the intention to treat principle to
compare the risk of an injury in the two groups. We
used Cox regression for the primary and secondary
outcomes and the robust calculation method of the
variance-covariance matrix,25 taking the cluster rando-
misation by clubs into account. Rate ratios were tested
with the Wald test. One way analysis of variance was
used to estimate the intracluster correlation coefficient
to obtain estimates of the inflation factor for compar-
ison withplannedsample size. Tocalculate thenumber
needed to prevent one injury we used the inverse of the
difference between percentages of injured players in
the two groups. We used one minus survival plots
basedontheCoxregressiontoevaluatepossibledelays
of theinjury preventioneffects ofthe programmein the
intervention group compared with the control group.
We used a Poisson model, taking cluster effects into
account, as a per protocol analysis to compare the rate
ratios of risk of injury between players in the inter-
vention group stratified into thirds of compliance
according to the number of prevention sessions
completed: low, intermediate, and high. The summary
measure of injury incidence (i) was calculated accord-
ing to the formula i=n/e, where n is the number of
injuries during the study period and e the sum of
exposure time expressed in player hours of match,
training, or in total. We calculated confidence intervals
of the rate ratio of the number of injuries in the
intervention and control groups by a simple Poisson
model, assuming constant hazard per group. Injury
incidences are presented as means with standard
errors. Rate ratios are presented with 95% confidence
intervals. We regarded two tailed P values ≤0.05 as
significant.
RESULTS
The final sample consisted of 52 clubs (1055 players) in
the intervention groupand 41 clubs (837 players) in the
control group (fig 3). The players in the two groups
were similar in age (15.4 (SD 0.7) years in both groups)
and age distribution. The dropout rate was similar
between the groups (23 (2.1%) v 24 (2.9%)).
Exposure and injury characteristics
Those in the intervention group played 49 899 hours of
football (16 057 hours of matches and 33 842 hours of
practice). The figure for the control group was 45 428
hours (14 342 and 31 086). During the eight month
season, 301 (16%) of the 1892 players included in the
study sustained a total of 376 injuries; 161 in the
intervention group, 215 in the control group. There
were 299 (80%) acute injuries and 77 (20%) overuse
injuries. The overall incidence of injuries was 3.9 (SD
0.2) per 1000 player hours (8.1 (SD 0.5) in matches and
1.9 (SD 0.2) in training).
Effect of revised injury prevention programme
The rate ratio for players with a lower extremity injury
between the intervention and the control group was
0.71 (0.49 to 1.03, P=0.072). There was a significantly
lower risk of injuries overall, overuse injuries, and
severe injuries in the intervention group (table 2). The
reduction in the risk of match injuries, training injuries,
knee injuries, and acute injuries (from 26% to 38%) did
not reach significance. The degree of clustering at the
club level (intracluster correlation coefficient) ranged
from 0.028 to 0.096. The estimated inflation factor
variedfrom1.54to2.86.Thenumberneededtotreatto
prevent one injury varied from 15 to 63 players. Figure
4 shows survival curves for lower extremity injuries
and severe injuries in the two groups.
The mean age of injured players was 15.4 (SD 0.6) in
the intervention group and 15.5 (SD 0.7) in the control
group. Table

body parts and the type of acute and overuse injuries
for both groups.
Compared with the control group, significantly
fewer players in the intervention group had two or
more injuries (rate ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval
0.29 to 0.87), while a reduction in the risk of re-injuries
did not reach significance (0.46, 0.20 to 1.01). Table 4
shows the severity distribution for different types of
injury. The overall rate of injuries, as well as the rate of
match injuries, training injuries, overuse injuries, and
acute injuries, differed significantly. The rate of severe
injuries, severe overuse injuries, and severe acute
injuries was significantly lower in the intervention
group.
Compliance with programme
The 52 clubs in the intervention group performed the
injury prevention programme for 44 (SD 22, range 11-
104) sessions (77%) throughout the season. The
average player attendance for matches and training
sessionswas11.7(57.9%ofalltheplayersontheroster),
which was similar to the average number who
participated in the warm-up programme (12.0
(59.4%) of all the players on the roster). The average
attendance in the control group was 12.2 (59.8% of all
the players on the roster). None of the clubs in the
control group reported performing structured warm-
up exercises comparable with the intervention. The
risk of injury was 35% lower in intervention players in
the third with the highest compliance (2.6 (20. to 3.2)
injuries/1000 player hours, mean (range 33-95) 49.2
sessions) compared with players in the intermediate
third (4.0 (3.0 to 5.0) injuries/1000 player hours, mean
23.4 (15-32) sessions) (rate ratio 0.65, 0.44 to 0.94,
P=0.02). The 32% reduction in risk of injury compared
with the third with the lowest compliance (3.7 (2.2 to
5.3) injuries/1000 player hours, mean 7.7 (0-14)
sessions) did not reach significance (rate ratio 0.68,
0.41 to 1.12, P=0.13).
DISCUSSION
This randomised controlled trial of a structured warm-
up programme in young female footballers showed
that the risk of injury can be reduced by about one third
and severe injuries by as much as one half. Although
the rate ratios for the different outcome variables
indicated a consistent effect on risk of injury across
most types of injury, the primary outcome—lower
extremity injury—did not reach significance when we
adjusted for the cluster sampling. There was, however,
a significant reduction in several secondary outcome
variables, including the rate of severe injuries, overuse
injuries, and injuries overall.
The effect of various intervention programmes
designed to reduce the risk of injury to the lower
extremities in young female footballers has been
studied previously.18-20 22 These studies, however,
were either non-randomised, had small sample sizes,
had low compliance, or had other important limita-
tions.
Methodological considerations
Thetrialtookplacein the15and16yeardivisionsfrom
the south, east, and middle of Norway and recruited
69% of all clubs and players organised by the
Norwegian Football Association in these areas. Of
the 181 clubs assessed for eligibility, 56 declined to
participate and 125 were randomised. During the
recruitment of clubs, the most common barrier to
participation that coaches reported was the additional
work of registering and reporting data weekly. Other
less common reasons for non-participation included a

reluctance to use the same warm-up programme for
every training session and match and low priority for
injury prevention. Thus, although we recruited a high
proportion of eligible teams, the final sample probably
included teams with more dedicated coaches. After
inclusion, we had to exclude 13 intervention clubs and
19 control clubs because they did not deliver any data
on injury or exposure. In most cases the coaches were
volunteers, such as parents, and the most common
reason for not reporting any data was the additional
work of registering and reporting data weekly. Despite
the fact that they were informed about the study both
orallyandinwritingbeforesigningupforparticipation,
after randomisation many of the coaches in the
excluded clubs decided that the extra work would be
too time consuming. Additionally, the disappointment
ofbeingrandomisedtothecontrolgroupandhencenot
receiving the warm-up programme might explain the
somewhat higher number of clubs we had to exclude
from the control group. We think it is unlikely that the
excluded clubs had coaches who were less “safety
conscious”thanthecoachesintheclubsthatcompleted
the study. Our experience with this and several other
studies is that, at the outset, few coaches consider
injuries as a factor they can influence.
With respect to the internal validity, we found no
differences between the two groups in their training or
match exposure during the study. The coaches in both
groups reported injuries and individual training and
match participation prospectively on weekly registra-
tion forms according to pre-specified protocols and
accepted injury definitions.24 Because we recorded
individual exposure we could adjust for playing time,
whichcanvarygreatlyamongplayers.Thisadjustment
mightbeimportantasthebestplayersplaymoregames
than substitutes and they might also train more.
Individual exposure also takes censorship into
account, such as abbreviated lengths of follow-up for
reasons other than injury (such as illness, moving,
quitting the sport).26 Another advantage of this
approach is that it provides accurate data about each
player’s exposure to the intervention, in this case the
injury prevention programme.
Injury recorders, who were blinded to group
allocation, interviewed the injured players using a
standardised injury questionnaire as soon as possible
after the weekly registration form was received. Even
so, some coaches might have overlooked injuries,
although this is less likely for more severe injuries such
as knee and ankle sprains. Our definition of reportable
injury embraced any injury that occurred during a
scheduled match or training session, causing the player
to be unable to fully take part in the next match or
training session.24 Given the individual activity logs
kept by the coaches, it is therefore unlikely that injuries
would go unreported, and we see no reason to expect a
reporting bias between the groups. Our method should
ensure good reliability and validity of the injury and
exposure data.
The intention to treat analysis showed that the
inflation factor for cluster effects was higher than our
powercalculation(2.7v1.8).Weestimatedtheinflation
factor on the incidence of lower extremity injuries in
our previous study on a similar sample.22 Yet our
results indicate that we might have underestimated the
number of players we needed to establish possible
interventioneffects. Thisis alsosupportedby thelarger
confidence intervals of the rate ratios calculated from
the Cox regression analysis (taking cluster randomisa-
tion into account) than the simpler Poisson regression
model (assuming constant hazard per group). In
addition,ourpowercalculationwasbasedonadropout
rate of 15% when the actual dropout rate was 25.6%.
Compliance
In our previous intervention study we tested the effect
of a training programme,21 in a similar cohort of young
female footballers.22 We were encouraged that com-
pliance in the current trial was higher than with the
previous programme (77% v 52%). One key objective
for the revision was to improve the compliance among
coaches and players, and, with this in mind, the revised
programme was expanded with more exercises to

training and matches. In addition, the first part of the
programme included exercises with a partner, which
seemed to appeal to the players.
The resources used to promote the programme
among the intervention teams were moderate so it
should be possible to replicate implementation in large
scale nationwide programmes. The coaches and team
captainswereintroducedtotheprogrammeduringone
three hour training session. To boost compliance we
also developed new information material for coaches
and players: a DVD showing all the exercises, a poster,
a loose leaf exercise book, and small exercise cards
attached to a handy neck strap that the coaches could
bring to the training field. It was up to the coaches and
team captains, however, to teach the programme to the
players on the roster. Furthermore, the clubs received
no follow-up visits throughout the season to refresh
coaching skills or give players feedback on their
performance. Despite the moderate efforts to promote
the programme, compliance was good and we saw
effects on the risk of injury. It should be possible to
implement the programme at the community level by
including injury prevention as part of basic coaching
educationandmakingeducationalmaterialsuchasthat
developed for the current study available to teams,
coaches, players, and parents.
The technical nature of many of the exercises in the
programmerequiredplayerstofocusduringtrainingto
gain the intended benefit. Site visits indicated that not
all of the players seemed to concentrate fully on the
performance of the exercises, which might be expected
for this age group. Furthermore, the compliance logs
documented that not all clubs completed the requested
minimum of two training sessions a week. We included
all clubs and players in the intention to treat analysis,
which means that the preventive effect of the
programme might be higher than reported. This is
supported by subgroup analyses within the inter-
vention group, indicating a trend towards a lower risk
of injury among the most compliant players.
Structured programme of warm-up exercises to prevent
injuries
The programme was developed on the basis of “The
11” programme21 and the prevent injury and enhance
performance (PEP) programme,20 combined with
running activities at the start and the end.27 The
running exercises were chosen not just to make the
programme more suitable as a warm up but also to
teach proper knee control and core stability during
cuttingandlanding.Furthermore,therevisedexercises
include both variety and progression of difficulty.
These elements were absent from the previously tested
training programme22 but exist in other successful
prevention programmes.27-30
The focus on core stability, balance, and neuromus-
cular control as well as hip control and knee alignment
thatavoidsexcessivekneevalgusduringbothstaticand
dynamic movements is a feature of earlier intervention
studies.18 20 27-29 31 This rationale is justified by data from
studies on the mechanisms of anterior cruciate
ligament injuries.32-36 These studies indicate that
players could benefit from not allowing the knee to
sagmedially duringfootball specific movements,when
suddenly changing speed, or when being tackled by
opponents. The programme therefore focused on
proper biomechanical technique and improved aware-
ness and control during standing, running, planting,
cutting, jumping, and landing.
The programme included a set of balance exercises,
and during single leg balance training the players were
also purposely pushed off balance; this provided an

additional challenge to the ability to maintain a stable
core and proper alignment. Previous studies in
footballers have shown that the rate of anterior cruciate
ligament injuries can be reduced by improving
dynamic and static balance, neuromuscular control,
and proprioception.20 28 Our programme also included
strength exercises, such as the “Nordic hamstring
lower,” which has been shown to increase eccentric
hamstring muscle strength37 and decrease the rate of
hamstring strain injuries.38 The hamstrings can act as
agonists to the anterior cruciate ligament during stop
and jump tasks,39-41 at least at knee flexion angles above
30°.42-44 Stronger hamstring muscles might therefore
prevent injuries to the ligament, but this theory has
never been tested directly. Based on data from
volleyball39 45 and team handball,27 29 we also encour-
aged players to reduce the impact of landings with
increased hip and knee flexion and to land on two legs
rather than one.
Our prevention programme is multifaceted and
addresses many factors that could be related to the risk
of injury (jogging and active stretching for general
warm up, strength, balance, awareness of vulnerable
hip and knee positions, technique of planting, cutting,
landing, and running), and it is not possible to
determine exactly which exercises or factors might
have been responsible for the observed effects. Further
studies are needed to determine what the key
components are so that future programmes might
require less time and effort.
Except for a few reports from coaches on muscular
soreness in the beginning of the intervention period
and one report about a minor hamstring strain, we
observed no negative effects of the programme.
Implications
We used young female footballers (aged 13-17) as a
model, and we do not know if the results can be
generalised to both sexes, other age groups, or other
youth sports. Similar preventive programmes, how-
ever, were effective in senior elite football,28 38 young
male footballers,46 and in both sexes in other sports.30 31
Furthermore, in youth team handball Olsen et al27 also
documented a substantial decrease in the rate of
injuries as a result of a similar structured warm-up
programme. Football differs from many other team
sports,however,in thatthereisamuch higherpotential
for direct contact to the lower extremities. Never-
theless, the mechanisms for serious knee injuries seem
to be comparable across many sports (mostly non-
contact, resulting from pivoting and landing move-
ments). It therefore seems reasonable to assume that
the programme we used could be modified for use in
other similar sports, at least for some types of injury.
One of the goals in sports injury prevention should
be to develop less vulnerable movement patterns.
Thus, it might be easier to work with even younger
playerswho have not yet establishedtheir basic motion
patterns. We therefore suggest that programmes to
improve strength, awareness, and neuromuscular
control of static and dynamic movements should be
implemented as soon as children start playing orga-
nised football.

the programme (with Norwegian text and narrator) are available at www.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
The injury rate among female footballers, regardless of age
and level of performance, approaches that of men
The risk of severe knee injuries, such as anterior cruciate
ligamentinjuries,isthreetofivetimeshigherforfemalethan
male football players
Studies from other sports indicate that it might be possible
to reduce the rate of lower extremity injuries, but no
programmes have been validated for female footballers
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
A comprehensivewarm-up programme designed to improve
strength, awareness, and neuromuscular control can
prevent injuries in young female footballers
The risk of injury can be reduced by about one third and the
risk of severe injuries by as much as a half
