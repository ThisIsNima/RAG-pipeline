Abstract
Agents in creative enterprises are embedded in networks that inspire, support, and evaluate their
work. Here, we investigate how the mechanisms by which creative teams self-assemble determine
the structure of these collaboration networks. We propose a model for the self-assembly of creative
teams that has its basis in three parameters: team size, the fraction of newcomers in new productions,
and the tendency of incumbents to repeat previous collaborations. The model suggests that the
emergence of a large connected community of practitioners can be described as a phase transition.
We find that team assembly mechanisms determine both the structure of the collaboration network
and team performance for teams derived from both artistic and scientific fields.
Teams are assembled because of the need to incorporate individuals with different ideas, skills,
and resources. Creativity is spurred when proven innovations in one domain are introduced
into a new domain, solving old problems and inspiring fresh thinking (1-4). However, research
shows that the right balance of diversity on a team is elusive. Although diversity may potentially
spur creativity, it typically promotes conflict and miscommunication (5-7). It also runs counter
to the security most individuals experience in working and sharing ideas with past collaborators
(8). Successful teams evolve toward a size that is large enough to enable specialization and
effective division of labor among teammates but small enough to avoid overwhelming costs
of group coordination (9). Here, we investigate empirically and theoretically the mechanisms
by which teams of creative agents are assembled. We also investigate how these microscopic
team assembly mechanisms determine both the macroscopic structure of a creative field and
the success of certain teams in using the resources and knowledge available in the field. We
develop a model for the assembly of teams of creative agents in which the selection of the
members of a team is controlled by three parameters: (i) the number, m, of team members; (ii)
the probability, p, of selecting incumbents, that is, agents already belonging to the network;
and (iii) the propensity, q, of incumbents to select past collaborators. The model predicts the
existence of two phases that are determined by the values of m, p, and q. In one phase, there
is a large cluster connecting a substantial fraction of the agents, whereas in the other phase the
agents form a large number of isolated clusters.

We analyzed data from both artistic and scientific fields where collaboration needs have
experienced pressures such as differentiation and specialization, internationalization, and
commercialization (4,10,11): (i) the Broadway musical industry (BMI) and (ii) the scientific
disciplines of social psychology, economics, ecology, and astronomy (Table 1). For the BMI,
we considered all 2258 productions in the period from 1877 to 1990 (12,13). Productions are
defined as musical shows that were performed at least once in Broadway. The team members
comprise individuals responsible for composing the music, writing the libretto and the lyrics,
designing the choreography, directing, and producing the show, but not the actors that
performed in it. For each of the scientific disciplines, we considered all collaborations that
resulted in publications in recognized journals within the fields studied (14): seven social
psychology journals, nine economics journals, 10 ecology journals, and six astronomy journals
(Table 2). Collaboration networks (15-19) were then built for each of the journals
independently and for the whole discipline by merging the data from the journals within a
discipline (Materials and Methods).
The evolution of team sizes in the BMI bears out the expectation that team size and composition
depend on the intricacy of the creative task. In the period from 1877 to 1929, when the form
of the Broadway musical show was still being worked out through trial and error (12), there
was a steady increase in the number of artists per production, from an average of two to an
average of seven (Fig. 1A). This increase in size suggests that teams evolved to manage the
complexity of the new artistic form. By the late 1920s, the Broadway musical reached the form
we know today, as did team composition (4). Since then, the typical set of artists creating a
Broadway musical have been choreographer, composer, director, librettist, lyricist, and
producer. For the following 55 years, a period that includes the Great Depression, World War
II, and the postwar boom, the average size of teams remained around seven (20).
We find similar scenarios for the evolution of team size in scientific collaborations. The four
fields experienced an increase in team size with time (Fig. 1, B to E). The increase has been
roughly linear in social psychology and economics and faster than linear in ecology and
astronomy. For social psychology, team size growth rate was greater for high-impact compared
with low-impact journals, suggesting that team size not only depends on the intricacy of the
enterprise but also that successful teams might adapt faster to external pressures.
The analysis of team size cannot capture the fact that teams are embedded in a larger network
(3). This complex network (21-26), which is the result of past collaborations and the medium
in which future collaborations will develop, acts as a storehouse for the pool of knowledge
created within the field. The way the members of a team are embedded in the larger network
affects the manner in which they access the knowledge in the field. Therefore, teams formed
by individuals with large but disparate sets of collaborators are more likely to draw from a
more diverse reservoir of knowledge. At the same time and for the same reasons, the way teams
are organized into a larger network affects the likelihood of breakthroughs occuring in a given
field.
The agents composing a team may be classified according to their experience. Some agents
are newcomers, that is, rookies, with little experience and unseasoned skills. Other agents are
incumbents. They are established persons with a track record, a reputation, and identifiable
talents. The differentiation of agents into newcomers and incumbents results in four possible
types of links within a team: (i) newcomer-newcomer, (ii) newcomer-incumbent, (iii)
incumbent-incumbent, and (iv) repeat incumbent-incumbent. The distribution of different
types of links reflects the team's underlying diversity. For example, if teams have a
preponderance of repeat incumbent-incumbent links, it is less likely that they will have
innovative ideas because their shared experiences tend to homogenize their pool of knowledge.

In contrast, teams with a variety of types of links are likely to have more diverse perspectives
to draw from and therefore to contribute more innovative solutions.
Because quantifying the emergence and the effects of team diversity (2,9,27-29) is more
difficult than measuring team size, we consider next a model for the assembly of teams. In our
model, we assemble N teams in temporal sequence. The assembly of each team is controlled
by three parameters: m, p, and q. The first parameter, m, is the number of agents in a team. In
our investigations of the model, we considered three situations: (i) keep m constant, (ii) draw
m from a distribution, or (iii) use a sequence of m values obtained from the data. For the
theoretical analysis of the model, we kept m constant, whereas comparison with an empirical
data set was done with the use of the sequence of m(t) values in the corresponding data set.
The second parameter, p, is the probability of a team member being an incumbent. Higher
values of p indicate fewer opportunities for newcomers to enter a field. The third parameter,
q, represents the inclination for incumbents to collaborate with prior collaborators rather than
initiate a new collaboration with an incumbent they have not worked with in the past.
We start at time zero with an endless pool of newcomers. Newcomers become incumbents the
first time step after being selected for a team. Each time step t, we assemble a new team and
add it to the network (Fig. 2). We select sequentially m(t) different agents. Each agent in a team
has a probability, p, of being drawn from the pool of incumbents and a probability, 1 – p, of
being drawn from the pool of newcomers. If the agent is drawn from the incumbents' pool and
there is already another incumbent in the team, then (i) with probability q the new agent is
randomly selected from among the set of collaborators of a randomly selected incumbent
already in the team; (ii) otherwise, he or she is selected at random among all incumbents in the
network.
Lastly, agents that remain inactive for longer than τ time steps are removed from the network.
This rule is motivated by the observation that agents do not remain in the network forever:
agents age and retire, change careers, and so on. The removal process enables the network to
reach a steady state after a transient time. Our results do not depend in the specific value of τ
(Materials and Methods).
Through participation in a team, agents become part of a large network (30). This fact prompted
us to examine the topology of the network of collaborations among the practitioners of a given
field. More specifically, we asked, “Is there a large connected cluster comprising most of the
agents or is the network composed of numerous smaller clusters?” A large connected cluster
would be supporting evidence for the so-called invisible college, the web of social and
professional contacts linking scientists across universities proposed by de Solla Price (31) and
Merton (32). A large number of small clusters would be indicative of a field made up of isolated
schools of thought. For all five fields considered here, we find that the network contains a large
connected cluster.
As is typically done in the study of percolation phase transitions (33), we use the fraction S of
agents that belong to the largest cluster of the network to quantify the transition between these
two regimes: invisible college or isolated schools. We explore systematically the (p,q)
parameter space of the model. We find that the system undergoes a percolation transition
(33) at a critical line, pc(m,q). That is, the system experiences a sharp transition from a multitude
of small clusters to a situation in which one large cluster, comprising a substantial fraction S
of the individuals, emerges: the so-called giant component (Fig. 3). The transition line
pc(m,q) therefore determines the tipping point for the emergence of the invisible college (34).
Our analysis shows that the existence of this transition is independent of the average number
of agents m  in a collaboration, although the precise value of pc(m,q) does depend on m.

The proximity to the transition line, which depends on the distribution of the different types
of links, determines the structure of the largest cluster (Fig. 3A). In the vicinity of the transition,
the largest cluster has an almost linear or branched structure (Fig. 3A) (p = 0.30). As one moves
toward larger p, the largest cluster starts to have more and more loops (Fig. 3A) (p = 0.35),
and, eventually, it becomes a densely connected network (Fig. 3A) (p = 0.60).
Networks with the same fraction, S, of nodes in the largest cluster do not necessarily correspond
to networks with identical properties. Each point in the (p,q) parameter space is characterized
by both S and the fraction, fR, of repeat incumbent-incumbent links. For example, in Fig. 3C,
the line fR = 0.32 corresponds to those values of p and q for which 32% of all links in new
teams are between repeat collaborators (35). The fR has a notable impact on the dynamics of
the network. When fR is large, collaborations are firmly established, and therefore the structure
of the network changes very slowly. In contrast, low values of fR correspond to enterprises
with high turnover and very fast dynamics. Intermediate values of fR are related to situations
in which collaboration patterns with peers are fluid (Materials and Methods).
For each of the five fields for which we have empirical data, we measure the relative size of
the giant component S (Materials and Methods). For all fields considered, S is larger than 50%
(Table 1). This result provides quantitative evidence for the existence of an invisible college
in all the fields. Intriguingly, the relative sizes of the giant component is similar for three of
the four fields considered: S = 0.70, S = 0.68, and S = 0.75 for BMI, social psychology, and
ecology, respectively. However, for astronomy S was significantly larger (0.92), whereas for
economics it was significantly smaller (0.54).
To gain further insight in the structure of collaboration networks, we used our model to estimate
the values of p and q for each field. Given the temporal sequence of teams producing the
network of collaborations, one can calculate the fraction of incumbents and the fraction of
repeat incumbent-incumbent links. These fractions and the model enable us to then estimate
the values of p and q that are consistent with the data (36).
We estimated p and q for each field and then simulated the model to predict the key properties
of the network of collaborations, including the degree distribution of the network and the
fraction S of nodes in the largest cluster. By comparing predictions of the model with the
empirical results, we are able to test and validate the model. We first compare the degree
distribution of the collaboration networks with the predictions of the model (Fig. 4, A to E)
and find that the model predicts the empirical degree distributions remarkably well. In Table
1, we compare the predictions of the model for S with the measured values. The model correctly
predicts that an invisible college containing more than 50% of the nodes exists in all cases.
Additionally, the values of S predicted by the model are in close agreement with the empirical
results.
To investigate how changes of the team assembly mechanism affect the structure of the
network, we used the model to generate networks with the same sequence of team sizes as the
data but with different values of p and q. We show in Fig. 4, F to J, that four out of the five
creative networks we consider are very close to the tipping line at which an invisible college
emerges. The exception is astronomy. We also find that, for astronomy, the fR is significantly
larger than for the other fields.
If diversity affects team performance and our model correctly captures how diversity is related
to the way teams are assembled, then the parameters p and q must be related to team
performance. To investigate this issue, we considered for the four scientific fields how teams
publishing in different journals are assembled. We used each journal's impact factor as a proxy
for the typical quality of teams' output. We then studied the different journals separately to
quantify the relationship between team assembly mechanisms and performance.

In Fig. 5, we show the values of p, q, and S for the journals in each of the fields as a function
of the impact factor of the journal. We found that p was positively correlated with impact factor
for economics, ecology, and social psychology, whereas q was negatively correlated with
impact factor for the same fields. The result for p implies that successful teams have a higher
fraction of incumbents, who contribute expertise and know-how to the team, whereas the result
for q implies that teams that are less diverse typically have lower levels of performance.
The relative size S of the giant component in a journal was also associated with performance
for ecology and social psychology. Teams publishing in journals with a high-impact factor
typically give rise to a large giant component, whereas teams publishing in low-impact journals
typically form small isolated clusters. This suggests that teams publishing in high-impact
journals perform a better sampling of the knowledge within a field and thus are able to more
efficiently use the resources of the invisible college. Surprisingly, neither p, q, or S were
significantly correlated with impact factor in astronomy. This distinguishes astronomy from
the other creative enterprises considered.
We have shown that team size evolves with time, probably up to an optimal size as in the case
of the BMI. A similar process may be occurring for the parameters quantifying expertise, p,
and diversity, q. Four of the five fields considered, all except astronomy, have very similar
values of p and q, thus suggesting that a “universal” set of optimal values might exist. The fact
that in astronomy there are no correlations between p, q, or S and the impact of journals also
indicates that this field is different from the others. Whether these differences are caused by
the needs imposed by the creative enterprise itself or to historical or other reasons is a question
that we cannot answer conclusively.

35. Figure 3C shows that large fR occurs when p and q are large and corresponds to a network in which
collaborations among incumbents are firmly established and opportunities for newcomers are few.
Conversely, small fR, which occurs when p and/or q are small, indicates plentiful opportunities for
newcomers to join new projects. In this case, newcomers are the norm and collaborations are rarely
repeated. Lastly, intermediate values of fR suggest intermediate values of both p and q, that is, a
situation for which there is a balance between seasoned incumbents and newcomers with fresh ideas.
36. The value of p is directly given by the fraction of incumbents in new creations. The value of q must
be obtained numerically by simulating the model with different tentative values of q until the fraction
fR of repeat incumbent-incumbent links predicted by the model coincides with the value measured
from the data.

Modeling the emergence of collaboration networks in creative enterprises. (A) Creation of a
team with m = 3 agents. Consider, at time zero, a collaboration network comprising five agents,
all incumbents (blue circles). Along with the incumbents, there is a large pool of newcomers
(green circles) available to participate in new teams. Each agent in a team has a probability p
of being drawn from the pool of incumbents and a probability 1 – p of being drawn from the
pool of newcomers. For the second and subsequent agents selected from the incumbents' pool:
(i) with probability q, the new agent is randomly selected from among the set of collaborators
of a randomly selected incumbent already in the team; (ii) otherwise, he or she is selected at
random among all incumbents in the network. For concreteness, let us assume that incumbent
4 is selected as the first agent in the new team (leftmost box). Let us also assume that the second
agent is an incumbent, too (center-left box). In this example, the second agent is a past
collaborator of agent 4, specifically agent 3 (center-right box). Lastly, the third agent is selected
from the pool of newcomers; this agent becomes incumbent 6 (rightmost box). In these boxes
and in the following panels and figures, blue lines indicate newcomer-newcomer
collaborations, green lines indicate newcomer-incumbent collaborations, yellow lines indicate
new incumbent-incumbent collaborations, and red lines indicate repeat collaborations. (B)

Predictions of the model. (A) Phase transition in the structure of the collaboration network.
We plot only the largest cluster in the network. For small p, the network is formed by numerous
small clusters (p = 0.10). At the critical point pc, the tipping point, a large cluster emerges, that
is, a cluster that contains a substantial fraction of the agents. In the vicinity of the transition,
the largest cluster has an almost linear or branched structure (p = 0.30). As p increases, the
largest cluster starts to have loops (p = 0.35) and eventually becomes a densely connected
cluster containing essentially all nodes in the network (p = 0.60). We show results for q = 0.5
and m = 4, where m is the number of agents in a team. (B) The transition described in (A) can
be characterized by the fraction S of nodes that belong to the giant component, the order
parameter, and the average size s  of the other clusters, the susceptibility (33). The model
displays a second-order percolation transition as the fraction p of incumbents increases from
0 to 1. The transition occurs for p = pc, which coincides with the maximum of s . Note that
pc is a decreasing function of m. We show results for q = 0.5 and m = 4 and m = 8. (C) We
display graphically the value of S as a function of p and q for m = 4. For any value of q, the
model displays the percolation transition, and the critical fraction pc depends on q, defining a
percolation line pc(m,q). The critical line pc(m,q) is an increasing function of q. Even though
the order parameter S is an important parameter to quantify the structure of the network, not
all points with the same S, that is, all points represented with the same color, correspond to
fields with identical properties. This result is made clear by the lines of equal fR. The upper-
right corner of the (p,q) plane is characterized by fR close to one, whereas the lower-left corner
corresponds to fR close to zero. As we show in Fig. 4, all fields considered have parameter
values above the transition line.

Network structure of different creative fields. Degree distributions for (A) the BMI, (B) the
field of social psychology, (C) the field of economics, (D) the field of ecology, and (E) the
field of astronomy. We carried out with the use of the sequence {m(t)} of team sizes found in
the empirical data and with the values of p and q estimated from the measured fractions of the
different types of links. We present the predictions of the model with the lines and the empirical
degree distributions with the open circles. For all cases considered, the data falls within the
95% confidence intervals of the predictions of the model. The (p,q) parameter space of the
network of collaborators is shown for (F) the BMI, (G) the field of social psychology, (H) the
field of economics, (I) the field of ecology, and (J) the field of astronomy. The solid lines
separating the red and the blue regions indicate the values of p and q for which 50% of the
nodes belong to the largest cluster, that is, the percolation transition at which a giant component,
the invisible college, emerges. The distance from the percolation line predicts the overall
structure of the network. For example, the networks in astronomy are well above the tipping
line and have a very dense structure (Table 1). In contrast, all other fields are close to the
transition and have relatively sparse giant components. Another important characteristic of the
network is provided by the value of fR. To help with the interpretation of the results, we plot
with dotted lines the curves for fR = 0.32. For four of the creative networks considered, we find
fR < 0.25. For astronomy, we find fR = 0.39.

Relation between team assembly mechanisms, network structure, and performance. We
calculate the values of p, q, and S for several journals in each of the four scientific fields
considered. In a few cases, q should be larger than one in order to reproduce the empirical
values of fR; in these cases, q is considered one and the corresponding points are shaded. We
plot the values of p, q, and S as a function of the impact factor of the journal and then use the
Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient rs to determine significant correlations. Shaded

state period from 1940 to 1985. The data for scientific publications was obtained from the Web of Science. We selected recognized journals in each of the
different scientific fields (Table 2). For each field, we show the total number of productions and agents in all the periods considered, the values of p and q
estimated with the model from the data, the fR, the size, N, of the network in the last year of the period considered, the value, Nmod, predicted by the model,
the fraction, S, of agents that belong to the largest cluster, and the value, Smod, predicted by the model. S takes values between 0 and 1 and does not depend
on the size of the network (31).

Table 2
Journal-specific network structure. We present the same information as in Table 1 for each of the journals studied. We ranked journals within each field
according to their impact factor (IF). For some low-impact journals, the fR is too high to be reproducible with the model. In those cases, which we represent
by q > 1, simulations of the model are done with q = 1. The model still reproduces the empirical results quite well for these cases.
