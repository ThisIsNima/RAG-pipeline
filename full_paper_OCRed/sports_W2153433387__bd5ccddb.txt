The
 ERC
 Guidelines
 2015
 that
 follow
 do
 not
 deﬁne
 the
 only
 way
that
 resuscitation
 can
 be
 delivered;
 they
 merely
 represent
 a
 widely
accepted
 view
 of
 how
 resuscitation
 should
 be
 undertaken
 both
safely
 and
 effectively.
 The
 publication
 of
 new
 and
 revised
 treat-
ment
 recommendations
 does
 not
 imply
 that
 current
 clinical
 care
 is
either
 unsafe
 or
 ineffective.
Summary
 of
 the
 changes
 since
 the
 2010
 Guidelines
Adult
 basic
 life
 support
 and
 automated
 external
 deﬁbrillation
• The
 ERC
 Guidelines
 2015
 highlight
 the
 critical
 importance
 of
the
 interactions
 between
 the
 emergency
 medical
 dispatcher,
 the
bystander
 who
 provides
 CPR
 and
 the
 timely
 deployment
 of
 an
AED.
 An
 effective,
 co-ordinated
 community
 response
 that
 draws
these
 elements
 together
 is
 key
 to
 improving
 survival
 from
 out-
of-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
 (Fig.
 1.1).
• The
 emergency
 medical
 dispatcher
 plays
 an
 important
 role
 in
the
 early
 diagnosis
 of
 cardiac
 arrest,
 the
 provision
 of
 dispatcher-
assisted
 CPR
 (also
 known
 as
 telephone
 CPR),
 and
 the
 location
 and
dispatch
 of
 an
 AED.
• The
 bystander
 who
 is
 trained
 and
 able
 should
 assess
 the
 collapsed
victim
 rapidly
 to
 determine
 if
 the
 victim
 is
 unresponsive
 and
 not
breathing
 normally
 and
 then
 immediately
 alert
 the
 emergency
services.

COMMUNITY 
RESPONSE
SAVES
 LIVES

Fig.
 1.1.
 The
 interactions
 between
 the
 emergency
 medical
 dispatcher,
 the
 bystander
who
 provides
 CPR
 and
 the
 timely
 use
 of
 an
 automated
 external
 deﬁbrillator
 are
 the
key
 ingredients
 for
 improving
 survival
 from
 out
 of
 hospital
 cardiac
 arrest.
• The
 victim
 who
 is
 unresponsive
 and
 not
 breathing
 normally
 is
in
 cardiac
 arrest
 and
 requires
 CPR.
 Bystanders
 and
 emergency
medical
 dispatchers
 should
 be
 suspicious
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
 in
any
 patient
 presenting
 with
 seizures
 and
 should
 carefully
 assess
whether
 the
 victim
 is
 breathing
 normally.
• CPR
 providers
 should
 perform
 chest
 compressions
 for
 all
 victims
in
 cardiac
 arrest.
 CPR
 providers
 trained
 and
 able
 to
 perform
 rescue
breaths
 should
 combine
 chest
 compressions
 and
 rescue
 breaths.
Our
 conﬁdence
 in
 the
 equivalence
 between
 chest
 compression-
only
 and
 standard
 CPR
 is
 not
 sufﬁcient
 to
 change
 current
 practice.
• High-quality
 CPR
 remains
 essential
 to
 improving
 outcomes.
 The
guidelines
 on
 compression
 depth
 and
 rate
 have
 not
 changed.
 CPR
providers
 should
 ensure
 chest
 compressions
 of
 adequate
 depth
(at
 least
 5
 cm
 but
 no
 more
 than
 6
 cm)
 with
 a
 rate
 of
 100–120
 com-
pressions
 min−1. After
 each
 compression
 allow
 the
 chest
 to
 recoil
completely
 and
 minimise
 interruptions
 in
 compressions.
 When
providing
 rescue
 breaths/ventilations
 spend
 approximately
 1
 s
inﬂating
 the
 chest
 with
 sufﬁcient
 volume
 to
 ensure
 the
 chest
 rises
visibly.
 The
 ratio
 of
 chest
 compressions
 to
 ventilations
 remains
30:2.
 Do
 not
 interrupt
 chest
 compressions
 for
 more
 than
 10
 s
 to
provide
 ventilations.
• Deﬁbrillation
 within
 3–5
 min
 of
 collapse
 can
 produce
 survival
rates
 as
 high
 as
 50–70%.
 Early
 deﬁbrillation
 can
 be
 achieved
through
 CPR
 providers
 using
 public
 access
 and
 on-site
 AEDs.
 Pub-
lic
 access
 AED
 programmes
 should
 be
 actively
 implemented
 in
public
 places
 that
 have
 a
 high
 density
 of
 citizens.
• The
 adult
 CPR
 sequence
 can
 be
 used
 safely
 in
 children
 who
 are
unresponsive
 and
 not
 breathing
 normally.
 Chest
 compression
depths
 in
 children
 should
 be
 at
 least
 one
 third
 of
 the
 depth
 of
the
 chest
 (for
 infants
 that
 is
 4
 cm,
 for
 children
 5
 cm).
• A
 foreign
 body
 causing
 severe
 airway
 obstruction
 is
 a
 medical
emergency
 and
 requires
 prompt
 treatment
 with
 back
 blows
 and,
if
 that
 fails
 to
 relieve
 the
 obstruction,
 abdominal
 thrusts.
 If
 the
victim
 becomes
 unresponsive
 CPR
 should
 be
 started
 immediately
whilst
 help
 is
 summoned.
Adult
 advanced
 life
 support
The
 ERC
 2015
 ALS
 Guidelines
 emphasise
 improved
 care
 and
implementation
 of
 the
 guidelines
 in
 order
 to
 improve
 patient
focused
 outcomes.11 The
 key
 changes
 since
 2010
 are:
• Continued
 emphasis
 on
 the
 use
 of
 rapid
 response
 systems
 for
 care
of
 the
 deteriorating
 patient
 and
 prevention
 of
 in-hospital
 cardiac
arrest.
• Continued
 emphasis
 on
 minimally
 interrupted
 high-quality
 chest
compressions
 throughout
 any
 ALS
 intervention:
 chest
 compres-
sions
 are
 paused
 brieﬂy
 only
 to
 enable
 speciﬁc
 interventions.
 This
includes
 minimising
 interruptions
 in
 chest
 compressions
 for
 less
than
 5
 s to
 attempt
 deﬁbrillation.
• Keeping
 the
 focus
 on
 the
 use
 of
 self-adhesive
 pads
 for
 deﬁbrilla-
tion
 and
 a
 deﬁbrillation
 strategy
 to
 minimise
 the
 preshock
 pause,
although
 we  recognise
 that
 deﬁbrillator
 paddles
 are
 used
 in
 some
settings.
• There
 is
 a
 new
 section
 on
 monitoring
 during
 ALS
 with
 an
increased
 emphasis
 on
 the
 use
 of
 waveform
 capnography
 to
 con-
ﬁrm
 and
 continually
 monitor
 tracheal
 tube
 placement,
 quality
 of
CPR
 and
 to
 provide
 an
 early
 indication
 of
 return
 of
 spontaneous
circulation
 (ROSC).
• There
 are
 a
 variety
 of
 approaches
 to
 airway
 management
 during
CPR
 and
 a
 stepwise
 approach
 based
 on
 patient
 factors
 and
 the
skills
 of
 the
 rescuer
 is
 recommended.
• The
 recommendations
 for
 drug
 therapy
 during
 CPR
 have
 not
changed,
 but
 there
 is
 greater
 equipoise
 concerning
 the
 role
 of
drugs
 in
 improving
 outcomes
 from
 cardiac
 arrest.
• The
 routine
 use
 of
 mechanical
 chest
 compression
 devices
 is
not
 recommended,
 but
 they
 are
 a
 reasonable
 alternative
 in
situations
 where
 sustained
 high-quality
 manual
 chest
 compres-
sions
 are
 impractical
 or
 compromise
 provider
 safety.
• Peri-arrest
 ultrasound
 may
 have
 a
 role
 in
 identifying
 reversible
causes
 of
 cardiac
 arrest.
• Extracorporeal
 life
 support
 techniques
 may
 have
 a
 role
 as
 a
 rescue
therapy
 in
 selected
 patients
 where
 standard
 ALS
 measures
 are
 not
successful.
Cardiac
 arrest
 in
 special
 circumstances
Special
 causes
This
 section
 has
 been
 structured
 to
 cover
 the
 potentially
reversible
 causes
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
 that
 must
 be
 identiﬁed
 or
excluded
 during
 any
 resuscitation.
 They
 are
 divided
 into
 two
 groups
of
 four
 –
 4Hs
 and
 4Ts:
 hypoxia;
 hypo-/hyperkalaemia
 and
 other
electrolyte
 disorders;
 hypo-/hyperthermia;
 hypovolaemia;
 tension
pneumothorax;
 tamponade
 (cardiac);
 thrombosis
 (coronary
 and
pulmonary);
 toxins
 (poisoning).
• Survival
 after
 an
 asphyxia-induced
 cardiac
 arrest
 is
 rare
 and
 sur-
vivors
 usually
 have
 severe
 neurological
 impairment.
 During
 CPR,
early
 effective
 ventilation
 of
 the
 lungs
 with
 supplementary
 oxy-
gen
 is
 essential.
• A
 high
 degree
 of
 clinical
 suspicion
 and
 aggressive
 treatment
 can
prevent
 cardiac
 arrest
 from
 electrolyte
 abnormalities.
 The
 new
algorithm
 provides
 clinical
 guidance
 to
 emergency
 treatment
 of
life-threatening
 hyperkalaemia.
• Hypothermic
 patients
 without
 signs
 of
 cardiac
 instability
 can
be
 rewarmed
 externally
 using
 minimally
 invasive
 techniques.
Patients
 with
 signs
 of
 cardiac
 instability
 should
 be
 transferred
directly
 to
 a
 centre
 capable
 of
 extracorporeal
 life
 support
 (ECLS).
• Early
 recognition
 and
 immediate
 treatment
 with
 intramuscular
adrenaline
 remains
 the
 mainstay
 of
 emergency
 treatment
 for
anaphylaxis.
• A
 new
 treatment
 algorithm
 for
 traumatic
 cardiac
 arrest
 was
developed
 to
 prioritise
 the
 sequence
 of
 life-saving
 measures.
• Transport
 with
 continuing
 CPR
 may
 be
 beneﬁcial
 in
 selected
patients
 where
 there
 is
 immediate
 hospital
 access
 to
 the
 catheter-
isation
 laboratory
 and
 experience
 in
 percutaneous
 coronary
intervention
 (PCI)
 with
 ongoing
 CPR.
• Recommendations
 for
 administration
 of
 ﬁbrinolytics
 when
 pul-
monary
 embolism
 is
 the
 suspected
 cause
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
 remain
unchanged.

Special
 environments
The
 special
 environments
 section
 includes
 recommendations
for
 the
 treatment
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
 occurring
 in
 speciﬁc
 locations.
These
 locations
 are
 specialised
 healthcare
 facilities
 (e.g.
 operating
theatre,
 cardiac
 surgery,
 catheterisation
 laboratory,
 dialysis
 unit,
dental
 surgery),
 commercial
 airplanes
 or
 air
 ambulances,
 ﬁeld
 of
play,
 outside
 environment
 (e.g.
 drowning,
 difﬁcult
 terrain,
 high
 alti-
tude,
 avalanche
 burial,
 lightning
 strike
 and
 electrical
 injuries)
 or
 the
scene
 of
 a
 mass
 casualty
 incident.
• A
 new
 section
 covers
 the
 common
 causes
 and
 relevant
 modiﬁca-
tion
 to
 resuscitative
 procedures
 in
 patients
 undergoing
 surgery.
• In
 patients
 following
 major
 cardiac
 surgery,
 key
 to
 successful
resuscitation
 is
 recognising
 the
 need
 to
 perform
 immediate
 emer-
gency
 resternotomy,
 especially
 in
 the
 context
 of
 tamponade
 or
haemorrhage,
 where
 external
 chest
 compressions
 may
 be
 inef-
fective.
• Cardiac
 arrest
 from
 shockable
 rhythms
 (ventricular
 ﬁbrillation
(VF)
 or
 pulseless
 ventricular
 tachycardia
 (pVT))
 during
 car-
diac
 catheterisation
 should
 immediately
 be
 treated
 with
 up
 to
three
 stacked
 shocks
 before
 starting
 chest
 compressions.
 Use
 of
mechanical
 chest
 compression
 devices
 during
 angiography
 is
 rec-
ommended
 to
 ensure
 high-quality
 chest
 compressions
 and
 to
reduce
 the
 radiation
 burden
 to
 personnel
 during
 angiography
with
 ongoing
 CPR.
• AEDs
 and
 appropriate
 CPR
 equipment
 should
 be
 mandatory
 on
board
 of
 all
 commercial
 aircraft
 in
 Europe,
 including
 regional
 and
low-cost
 carriers.
 Consider
 an
 over-the-head
 technique
 of
 CPR
 if
restricted
 access
 precludes
 a
 conventional
 method.
• Sudden
 and
 unexpected
 collapse
 of
 an
 athlete
 on
 the
 ﬁeld
 of
 play
is
 likely
 to
 be
 cardiac
 in
 origin
 and
 requires
 rapid
 recognition
 and
early
 deﬁbrillation.
• Submersion
 exceeding
 10
 min
 is
 associated
 with
 poor
 outcome.
Bystanders
 play
 a
 critical
 role
 in
 early
 rescue
 and
 resuscitation.
Resuscitation
 strategies
 for
 those
 in
 respiratory
 or
 cardiac
 arrest
continue
 to
 prioritise
 oxygenation
 and
 ventilation.
• The
 chances
 of
 good
 outcome
 from
 cardiac
 arrest
 in
 difﬁ-
cult
 terrain
 or
 mountains
 may
 be
 reduced
 because
 of
 delayed
access
 and
 prolonged
 transport.
 There
 is
 a
 recognised
 role
 of
air
 rescue
 and
 availability
 of
 AEDs
 in
 remote
 but
 often-visited
locations.
• The
 cut-off
 criteria
 for
 prolonged
 CPR
 and
 extracorporeal
rewarming
 of
 avalanche
 victims
 in
 cardiac
 arrest
 have
 become
more
 stringent
 to
 reduce
 the
 number
 of
 futile
 cases
 treated
 with
extracorporeal
 life
 support
 (ECLS).
• Safety
 measures
 are
 emphasised
 when
 providing
 CPR
 to
 the
 vic-
tim
 of
 an
 electrical
 injury.
• During
 mass
 casualty
 incidents
 (MCIs),
 if
 the
 number
 of
 casu-
alties
 overwhelms
 healthcare
 resources,
 withhold
 CPR
 for
 those
without
 signs
 of
 life.
Special
 patients
The
 section
 on
 special
 patients
 gives
 guidance
 for
 CPR
 in
 patients
with
 severe
 comorbidities
 (asthma,
 heart
 failure
 with
 ventricular
assist
 devices,
 neurological
 disease,
 obesity)
 and
 those
 with
 speciﬁc
physiological
 conditions
 (pregnancy,
 elderly
 people).
• In
 patients
 with
 ventricular
 assist
 devices
 (VADs),
 conﬁrmation
of
 cardiac
 arrest
 may
 be
 difﬁcult.
 If
 during
 the
 ﬁrst
 10
 days
 after
surgery,
 cardiac
 arrest
 does
 not
 respond
 to
 deﬁbrillation,
 perform
resternotomy
 immediately.
• Patients
 with
 subarachnoid
 haemorrhage
 may
 have
 ECG
 changes
that
 suggest
 an
 acute
 coronary
 syndrome
 (ACS).
 Whether
 a
 com-
puted
 tomography
 (CT)
 brain
 scan
 is
 done
 before
 or
 after
 coronary
angiography
 will
 depend
 on
 clinical
 judgement.
• No
 changes
 to
 the
 sequence
 of
 actions
 are
 recommended
 in
 resus-
citation
 of
 obese
 patients,
 but
 delivery
 of
 effective
 CPR
 may
 be
challenging.
 Consider
 changing
 rescuers
 more
 frequently
 than
the
 standard
 2-min
 interval.
 Early
 tracheal
 intubation
 is
 recom-
mended.
• For
 the
 pregnant
 woman
 in
 cardiac
 arrest,
 high-quality
 CPR
 with
manual
 uterine
 displacement,
 early
 ALS
 and
 delivery
 of
 the
 foetus
if
 early
 return
 of
 spontaneous
 circulation
 (ROSC)
 is
 not
 achieved
remain
 key
 interventions.
Post-resuscitation
 care
This
 section
 is
 new
 to
 the
 European
 Resuscitation
 Council
 Guide-
lines;
 in
 2010
 the
 topic
 was
 incorporated
 into
 the
 section
 on
 ALS.12
The
 ERC
 has
 collaborated
 with
 the
 European
 Society
 of
 Intensive
Care
 Medicine
 to
 produce
 these
 post-resuscitation
 care
 guidelines,
which
 recognise
 the
 importance
 of
 high-quality
 post-resuscitation
care
 as
 a
 vital
 link
 in
 the
 Chain
 of
 Survival.13
The
 most
 important
 changes
 in
 post-resuscitation
 care
 since
2010
 include:
• There
 is
 a
 greater
 emphasis
 on
 the
 need
 for
 urgent
 coro-
nary
 catheterisation
 and
 percutaneous
 coronary
 intervention
(PCI)
 following
 out-of-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
 of
 likely
 cardiac
cause.
• Targeted
 temperature
 management
 remains
 important
 but
 there
is
 now
 an
 option
 to
 target
 a
 temperature
 of
 36 ◦C instead
 of
the
 previously
 recommended
 32–34 ◦C.
 The
 prevention
 of
 fever
remains
 very
 important.
• Prognostication
 is
 now
 undertaken
 using
 a
 multimodal
 strategy
and
 there
 is
 emphasis
 on
 allowing
 sufﬁcient
 time
 for
 neurological
recovery
 and
 to
 enable
 sedatives
 to
 be
 cleared.
• A
 novel
 section
 has
 been
 added
 which
 addresses
 rehabilitation
after
 survival
 from
 a
 cardiac
 arrest.
 Recommendations
 include
 the
systematic
 organisation
 of
 follow-up
 care,
 which
 should
 include
screening
 for
 potential
 cognitive
 and
 emotional
 impairments
 and
provision
 of
 information.
Paediatric
 life
 support
Guideline
 changes
 have
 been
 made
 in
 response
 to
 convincing
new
 scientiﬁc
 evidence
 and,
 by
 using
 clinical,
 organisational
 and
educational
 ﬁndings,
 they
 have
 been
 adapted
 to
 promote
 their
 use
and
 ease
 for
 teaching.
Basic
 life
 support
• The
 duration
 of
 delivering
 a
 breath
 is
 about
 1
 s,
 to
 coincide
 with
adult
 practice.
• For
 chest
 compressions,
 the
 lower
 sternum
 should
 be
 depressed
by
 at
 least
 one
 third
 the
 anterior-posterior
 diameter
 of
 the
 chest
(4
 cm
 for
 the
 infant
 and
 5
 cm
 for
 the
 child).
Managing
 the
 seriously
 ill
 child
• If
 there
 are
 no
 signs
 of
 septic
 shock,
 then
 children
 with
 a
 febrile
illness
 should
 receive
 ﬂuid
 with
 caution
 and
 reassessment
 follow-
ing
 its
 administration.
 In
 some
 forms
 of
 septic
 shock,
 restricting
ﬂuids
 with
 isotonic
 crystalloid
 may
 be
 of
 beneﬁt
 as
 compared
 to
liberal
 use
 of
 ﬂuids.
• For
 cardioversion
 of
 a
 supraventricular
 tachycardia
 (SVT),
 the
 ini-
tial
 dose
 has
 been
 revised
 to
 1
 J kg-1.
Paediatric
 cardiac
 arrest
 algorithm
• Many
 of
 the
 features
 are
 common
 with
 adult
 practice.
Post-resuscitation
 care
• Prevent
 fever
 in
 children
 who
 have
 return
 of
 spontaneous

• Targeted
 temperature
 management
 of
 children
 post-ROSC
 should
be
 either
 normothermia
 or
 mild
 hypothermia.
• There
 is
 no
 single
 predictor
 for
 when
 to
 stop
 resuscitation.
Resuscitation
 and
 support
 of
 transition
 of
 babies
 at
 birth
The
 following
 are
 the
 main
 changes
 that
 have
 been
 made
 to
 the
ERC
 guidelines
 for
 resuscitation
 at
 birth
 in
 2015:
• Support
 of
 transition: Recognising
 the
 unique
 situation
 of
 the
baby
 at
 birth,
 who
 rarely
 requires
 resuscitation
 but
 sometimes
needs
 medical
 help
 during
 the
 process
 of
 postnatal
 transition.
The
 term
 support
 of
 transition
 has
 been
 introduced
 to
 better
 dis-
tinguish
 between
 interventions
 that
 are
 needed
 to
 restore
 vital
organ
 functions
 (resuscitation)
 or
 to
 support
 transition.
• Cord
 clamping:  For
 uncompromised
 babies,
 a
 delay
 in
 cord
clamping
 of
 at
 least
 1
 min
 from
 the
 complete
 delivery
 of
 the
infant,
 is
 now
 recommended
 for
 term
 and
 preterm
 babies.
 As
yet
 there
 is
 insufﬁcient
 evidence
 to
 recommend
 an
 appropriate
time
 for
 clamping
 the
 cord
 in
 babies
 who
 require
 resuscitation
 at
birth.
• Temperature: The
 temperature
 of
 newly
 born
 non-asphyxiated
infants
 should
 be
 maintained
 between
 36.5 ◦C
 and
 37.5 ◦C
 after
birth.
 The
 importance
 of
 achieving
 this
 has
 been
 highlighted
 and
reinforced
 because
 of
 the
 strong
 association
 with
 mortality
 and
morbidity.
 The
 admission
 temperature
 should
 be
 recorded
 as
 a
predictor
 of
 outcome
 as
 well
 as
 a
 quality
 indicator.
• Maintenance
 of
 temperature:
 At
 <32
 weeks
 gestation,
 a
 combi-
nation
 of
 interventions
 may
 be
 required
 in
 addition
 to
 maintain
the
 temperature
 between
 36.5 ◦C
 and
 37.5 ◦C
 after
 delivery
through
 admission
 and
 stabilisation.
 These
 may
 include
 warmed
humidiﬁed
 respiratory
 gases,
 increased
 room
 temperature
 plus
plastic
 wrapping
 of
 body
 and
 head,
 plus
 thermal
 mattress
 or
 a
thermal
 mattress
 alone,
 all
 of
 which
 have
 been
 effective
 in
 reduc-
ing
 hypothermia.
• Optimal
 assessment
 of
 heart
 rate:
 It
 is
 suggested
 in
 babies
requiring
 resuscitation
 that
 the
 ECG
 can
 be
 used
 to
 provide
 a
 rapid
and
 accurate
 estimation
 of
 heart
 rate.
• Meconium: Tracheal
 intubation
 should
 not
 be
 routine
 in
 the
presence
 of
 meconium
 and
 should
 only
 be
 performed
 for
 sus-
pected
 tracheal
 obstruction.
 The
 emphasis
 should
 be
 on
 initiating
ventilation
 within
 the
 ﬁrst
 minute
 of
 life
 in
 non-breathing
 or
ineffectively
 breathing
 infants
 and
 this
 should
 not
 be
 delayed.
• Air/oxygen:
 Ventilatory
 support
 of
 term
 infants
 should
 start
 with
air.
 For
 preterm
 infants,
 either
 air
 or
 a
 low
 concentration
 of
 oxy-
gen
 (up
 to
 30%)
 should
 be
 used
 initially.
 If,
 despite
 effective
ventilation,
 oxygenation
 (ideally
 guided
 by
 oximetry)
 remains
unacceptable,
 use
 of
 a
 higher
 concentration
 of
 oxygen
 should
 be
considered.
• CPAP:
 Initial
 respiratory
 support
 of
 spontaneously
 breathing
preterm
 infants
 with
 respiratory
 distress
 may
 be
 provided
 by
CPAP
 rather
 than
 intubation.
Acute
 coronary
 syndromes
The
 following
 is
 a
 summary
 of
 the
 most
 important
 new
 views
and
 changes
 in
 recommendations
 for
 the
 diagnosis
 and
 treatment
of
 acute
 coronary
 syndromes
 (ACS).
Diagnostic
 Interventions
 in
 ACS
• Pre-hospital
 recording
 of
 a
 12-lead
 electrocardiogram
 (ECG)
 is
recommended
 in
 patients
 with
 suspected
 ST
 segment
 elevation
acute
 myocardial
 infarction
 (STEMI).
 For
 those
 with
 STEMI
 this
expedites
 pre-hospital
 and
 in-hospital
 reperfusion
 and
 reduces
mortality.
• Non-physician
 ECG
 STEMI
 interpretation
 with
 or
 without
 the
 aid
of
 computer
 ECG
 STEMI
 interpretation
 is
 suggested
 if
 adequate
diagnostic
 performance
 can
 be
 maintained
 through
 carefully
monitored
 quality
 assurance
 programmes.
• Pre-hospital
 STEMI
 activation
 of
 the
 catheterisation
 laboratory
may
 not
 only
 reduce
 treatment
 delays
 but
 may
 also
 reduce
patient
 mortality.
• The
 use
 of
 negative
 high-sensitivity
 cardiac
 troponins
 (hs-cTn)
during
 initial
 patient
 evaluation
 cannot
 be
 used
 as
 a
 standalone
measure
 to
 exclude
 an
 ACS,
 but
 in
 patients
 with
 very
 low
 risk
scores
 may
 justify
 early
 discharge.
Therapeutic
 Interventions
 in
 ACS
• Adenosine
 diphosphate
 (ADP)
 receptor
 antagonists
 (clopidogrel,
ticagrelor,
 or
 prasugrel-with
 speciﬁc
 restriction),
 may
 be
 given
either
 pre-hospital
 or
 in
 the
 ED
 for
 STEMI
 patients
 planned
 for
primary
 PCI.
• Unfractionated
 heparin
 (UFH)
 can
 be
 administered
 either
 in
 the
pre-hospital
 or
 in-hospital
 setting
 in
 patients
 with
 STEMI
 and
 a
planned
 primary
 PCI
 approach.
• Pre-hospital
 enoxaparin
 may
 be
 used
 as
 an
 alternative
 to
 pre-
hospital
 UFH
 for
 STEMI.
• Patients
 with
 acute
 chest
 pain
 with
 presumed
 ACS
 do
 not
 need
supplemental
 oxygen
 unless
 they
 present
 with
 signs
 of
 hypoxia,
dyspnoea,
 or
 heart
 failure.
Reperfusion
 decisions
 in
 STEMI
Reperfusion
 decisions
 have
 been
 reviewed
 in
 a
 variety
 of
 possi-
ble
 local
 situations.
• When
 ﬁbrinolysis
 is
 the
 planned
 treatment
 strategy,
 we
 recom-
mend
 using
 pre-hospital
 ﬁbrinolysis
 in
 comparison
 to
 in-hospital
ﬁbrinolysis
 for
 STEMI
 where
 transport
 times
 are
 >30
 min
 and
pre-hospital
 personnel
 are
 well
 trained.
• In
 geographic
 regions
 where
 PCI
 facilities
 exist
 and
 are
 available,
direct
 triage
 and
 transport
 for
 PCI
 is
 preferred
 to
 pre-hospital
ﬁbrinolysis
 for
 STEMI.
• Patients
 presenting
 with
 STEMI
 in
 the
 emergency
 department
(ED)
 of
 a
 non-PCI
 capable
 hospital
 should
 be
 transported
immediately
 to
 a
 PCI
 centre
 provided
 that
 treatment
 delays
for
 PPCI
 are
 less
 than
 120
 min
 (60–90
 min
 for
 early
 presen-
ters
 and
 those
 with
 extended
 infarctions),
 otherwise
 patients
should
 
receive
 
ﬁbrinolysis
 
and
 
be
 
transported
 
to
 
a
 
PCI
centre.
• Patients
 who
 receive
 ﬁbrinolytic
 therapy
 in
 the
 emergency
department
 of
 a
 non-PCI
 centre
 should
 be
 transported
 if
 possi-
ble
 for
 early
 routine
 angiography
 (within
 3–24
 h
 from
 ﬁbrinolytic
therapy)
 rather
 than
 be
 transported
 only
 if
 indicated
 by
 the
 pres-
ence
 of
 ischaemia.
• PCI
 in
 less
 than
 3
 h
 following
 administration
 of
 ﬁbrinolytics
 is
not
 recommended
 and
 can
 be
 performed
 only
 in
 case
 of
 failed
ﬁbrinolysis.
Hospital
 reperfusion
 decisions
 after
 return
 of
 spontaneous
circulation
• We
 recommend
 emergency
 cardiac
 catheterisation
 lab
 eval-
uation
 (and
 immediate
 PCI
 if
 required),
 in
 a
 manner
 similar
to
 patients
 with
 STEMI
 without
 cardiac
 arrest,
 in
 selected
adult
 patients
 with
 ROSC
 after
 out-of-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
(OHCA)
 
of
 
suspected
 
cardiac
 
origin
 
with
 
ST-elevation
 
on
ECG.
• In
 patients
 who
 are
 comatose
 and
 with
 ROSC
 after
 OHCA
 of
 sus-
pected
 cardiac
 origin
 without
 ST-elevation
 on
 ECG
 It
 is
 reasonable

to
 consider
 an
 emergency
 cardiac

 lab
 evaluation
in
 patients
 with
 the
 highest
 risk
 of
 coronary

 cardiac
 arrest.
First
 aid
A
 section
 on
 ﬁrst
 aid
 is
 included
 for
 the
 ﬁrst
 time
 in
 the
 2015
ERC
 Guidelines.
Principles
 of
 education
 in
 resuscitation
The
 following
 is
 a
 summary
 of
 the
 most
 important
 new
 views
 or
changes
 in
 recommendations
 for
 education
 in
 resuscitation
 since
the
 last
 ERC
 guidelines
 in
 2010.
Training
• In
 centres
 that
 have
 the
 resources
 to
 purchase
 and
 maintain
 high
ﬁdelity
 manikins,
 we
 recommend
 their
 use.
 The
 use
 of
 lower
ﬁdelity
 manikins
 however
 is
 appropriate
 for
 all
 levels
 of
 training
on
 ERC
 courses.
• Directive
 CPR
 feedback
 devices
 are
 useful
 for
 improving
 com-
pression
 rate,
 depth,
 release,
 and
 hand
 position.
 Tonal
 devices
improve
 compression
 rates
 only
 and
 may
 have
 a
 detrimental
effect
 on
 compression
 depth
 while
 rescuers
 focus
 on
 the
 rate.
• The
 intervals
 for
 retraining
 will
 differ
 according
 to
 the
 character-
istics
 of
 the
 participants
 (e.g.
 lay
 or
 healthcare).
 It
 is
 known
 that
CPR
 skills
 deteriorate
 within
 months
 of
 training
 and
 therefore
annual
 retraining
 strategies
 may
 not
 be
 frequent
 enough.
 Whilst
optimal
 intervals
 are
 not
 known,
 frequent
 ‘low
 dose’
 retraining
may be
 beneﬁcial.
• Training
 in
 non-technical
 skills
 (e.g.
 communication
 skills,
 team
leadership
 and
 team
 member
 roles)
 is
 an
 essential
 adjunct
 to
the
 training
 of
 technical
 skills.
 This
 type
 of
 training
 should
 be
incorporated
 into
 life
 support
 courses.
• Ambulance
 service
 dispatchers
 have
 an
 inﬂuential
 role
 to
 play
 in
guiding
 lay
 rescuers
 how
 to
 deliver
 CPR.
 This
 role
 needs
 speciﬁc
training
 in
 order
 to
 deliver
 clear
 and
 effective
 instructions
 in
 a
stressful
 situation.
Implementation
• Data-driven
 performance-focused
 debrieﬁng
 has
 been
 shown
 to
improve
 performance
 of
 resuscitation
 teams.
 We  highly
 recom-
mend
 its
 use
 for
 teams
 managing
 patients
 in
 cardiac
 arrest.
• Regional
 systems
 including
 cardiac
 arrest
 centres
 are
 to
 be
encouraged,
 as
 there
 is
 an
 association
 with
 increased
 survival
and
 improved
 neurological
 outcome
 in
 victims
 of
 out-of-hospital
cardiac
 arrest.
• Novel
 systems
 are
 being
 developed
 to
 alert
 bystanders
 to
 the
location
 of
 the
 nearest
 AED.
 Any
 technology
 that
 improves
 the
delivery
 of
 swift
 bystander
 CPR
 with
 rapid
 access
 to
 an
 AED
 is
 to
be
 encouraged.
• “It
 
takes
 
a
 
system
 
to
 
save
 
a
 
life”
 
[http://www.
resuscitationacademy.com/].
 Healthcare
 systems
 with
 a
 respon-
sibility
 for
 the
 management
 of
 patients
 in
 cardiac
 arrest
 (e.g.
EMS
 organisations,
 cardiac
 arrest
 centres)
 should
 evaluate
 their
processes
 to
 ensure
 that
 they
 are
 able
 to
 deliver
 care
 that
 ensures
the
 best
 achievable
 survival
 rates.
The
 ethics
 of
 resuscitation
 and
 end-of-life
 decisions
The
 2015
 ERC
 Guidelines
 include
 a
 detailed
 discussion
 of
 the
ethical
 principles
 underpinning
 cardiopulmonary
 resuscitation.
The
 international
 consensus
 on
 cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
 science
The
 International
 Liaison
 Committee
 on
 Resuscitation
 (ILCOR,
www.ilcor.org)
 includes
 representatives
 from
 the
 American
 Heart
Association
 (AHA),
 the
 European
 Resuscitation
 Council
 (ERC),
 the
Heart
 and
 Stroke
 Foundation
 of
 Canada
 (HSFC),
 the
 Australian
 and
New
 Zealand
 Committee
 on
 Resuscitation
 (ANZCOR),
 the
 Resusci-
tation
 Council
 of
 Southern
 Africa
 (RCSA),
 the
 Inter-American
 Heart
Foundation
 (IAHF),
 and
 the
 Resuscitation
 Council
 of
 Asia
 (RCA).
Since
 2000,
 researchers
 from
 the
 ILCOR
 member
 councils
 have
evaluated
 resuscitation
 science
 in
 5-yearly
 cycles.
 The
 most
 recent
International
 Consensus
 Conference
 was
 held
 in
 Dallas
 in
 February
2015
 and
 the
 published
 conclusions
 and
 recommendations
 from
this
 process
 form
 the
 basis
 of
 these
 ERC
 Guidelines
 2015.14
In
 addition
 to
 the
 six
 ILCOR
 task
 forces
 from
 2010
 (basic
 life
 sup-
port
 (BLS);
 advanced
 life
 support
 (ALS);
 acute
 coronary
 syndromes
(ACS);
 paediatric
 life
 support
 (PLS);
 neonatal
 life
 support
 (NLS);
and
 education,
 implementation
 and
 teams
 (EIT))
 a
 First
 Aid
 task
force
 was
 created.
 The
 task
 forces
 identiﬁed
 topics
 requiring
 evi-
dence
 evaluation
 and
 invited
 international
 experts
 to
 review
 them.
As
 in
 2010,
 a
 comprehensive
 conﬂict
 of
 interest
 (COI)
 policy
 was
applied.14
For
 each
 topic,
 two
 expert
 reviewers
 were
 invited
 to
 under-
take
 independent
 evaluations.
 Their
 work
 was
 supported
 by
 a
 new
and
 unique
 online
 system
 called
 SEERS
 (Scientiﬁc
 Evidence
 Eval-
uation
 and
 Review
 System),
 developed
 by
 ILCOR.
 To
 assess
 the
quality
 of
 the
 evidence
 and
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 recommendations,
ILCOR
 adopted
 the
 GRADE
 (Grading
 of
 Recommendations
 Assess-
ment,
 Development
 and
 Evaluation)
 methodology.15 The
 ILCOR
2015
 Consensus
 Conference
 was
 attended
 by
 232
 participants
 rep-
resenting
 39
 countries;
 64%
 of
 the
 attendees
 came
 from
 outside
the
 United
 States.
 This
 participation
 ensured
 that
 this
 ﬁnal
 publica-
tion
 represents
 a
 truly
 international
 consensus
 process.
 During
 the
three
 years
 leading
 up
 to
 this
 conference,
 250
 evidence
 reviewers
from
 39
 countries
 reviewed
 thousands
 of
 relevant,
 peer-reviewed
publications
 to
 address
 169
 speciﬁc
 resuscitation
 questions,
 each
in
 the
 standard
 PICO
 (Population,
 Intervention,
 Comparison,
 Out-
come)
 format.
 Each
 science
 statement
 summarised
 the
 experts’
interpretation
 of
 all
 relevant
 data
 on
 the
 speciﬁc
 topic
 and
 the
relevant
 ILCOR
 task
 force
 added
 consensus
 draft
 treatment
 recom-
mendations.
 Final
 wording
 of
 science
 statements
 and
 treatment
recommendations
 was
 completed
 after
 further
 review
 by
 ILCOR
member
 organisations
 and
 by
 the
 editorial
 board,
 and
 published
in
 Resuscitation
 and
 Circulation
 as
 the
 2015
 Consensus
 on
 Sci-
ence
 and
 Treatment
 Recommendations
 (CoSTR).16,17 The
 member
organisations
 forming
 ILCOR
 will
 publish
 resuscitation
 guidelines
that
 are
 consistent
 with
 this
 CoSTR
 document,
 but
 will
 also
 con-
sider
 geographic,
 economic
 and
 system
 differences
 in
 practice,
 and
the
 availability
 of
 medical
 devices
 and
 drugs.
From
 science
 to
 guidelines
These
 ERC
 Guidelines
 2015
 are
 based
 on
 the
 2015
 CoSTR
 doc-
ument
 and
 represent
 consensus
 among
 the
 members
 of
 the
 ERC
General
 Assembly.
 New
 to
 the
 ERC
 Guidelines
 2015
 are
 the
 First
 Aid
Guidelines,
 created
 in
 parallel
 with
 the
 First
 Aid
 Task
 Force
 of
 ILCOR,
and
 guidelines
 on
 post-resuscitation
 care.
 For
 each
 section
 of
 the
ERC
 Guidelines
 2015,
 a
 writing
 group
 was
 assigned
 that
 drafted
 and
agreed
 on
 the
 manuscript
 prior
 to
 approval
 by
 the
 General
 Assem-
bly
 and
 the
 ERC
 Board.
 In
 areas
 where
 ILCOR
 had
 not
 conducted
 a
systematic
 review,
 the
 ERC
 writing
 group
 undertook
 focused
 litera-
ture
 reviews.
 The
 ERC
 considers
 these
 new
 guidelines
 to
 be
 the
 most
effective
 and
 easily
 learned
 interventions
 that
 can
 be
 supported
by
 current
 knowledge,
 research
 and
 experience.
 Inevitably,

within
 Europe,
 differences
 in
 the
 availability
 of
 drugs,
 equipment,
and
 personnel
 will
 necessitate
 local,
 regional
 and
 national
 adapta-
tion
 of
 these
 guidelines.
 Some
 of
 the
 recommendations
 made
 in
 the
ERC
 Guidelines
 2010
 remain
 unchanged
 in
 2015,
 either
 because
 no
new
 studies
 have
 been
 published
 or
 because
 new
 evidence
 since
2010
 has
 merely
 strengthened
 the
 evidence
 that
 was
 already
 avail-
able.
Adult
 basic
 life
 support
 and
 automated
 external
deﬁbrillation
The
 basic
 life
 support
 (BLS)
 and
 automated
 external
 deﬁbril-
lation
 (AED)
 chapter
 contains
 guidance
 on
 the
 techniques
 used
during
 the
 initial
 resuscitation
 of
 an
 adult
 cardiac
 arrest
 victim.
This
 includes
 BLS
 (airway,
 breathing
 and
 circulation
 support
 with-
out
 the
 use
 of
 equipment
 other
 than
 a
 protective
 device)
 and
 the
 use
of
 an
 AED.
 In
 addition,
 simple
 techniques
 used
 in
 the
 management
of
 choking
 (foreign
 body
 airway
 obstruction)
 are
 included.
 Guide-
lines
 for
 the
 use
 of
 manual
 deﬁbrillators
 and
 starting
 in-hospital
resuscitation
 are
 found
 in
 section
 3.2 A
 summary
 of
 the
 recovery
position
 is
 included,
 with
 further
 information
 provided
 in
 the
 First
Aid
 Chapter.
The
 guidelines
 are
 based
 on
 the
 ILCOR
 2015
 Consensus
 on
 Sci-
ence
 and
 Treatment
 Recommendations
 (CoSTR)
 for
 BLS/AED.18 The
ILCOR
 review
 focused
 on
 23
 key
 topics
 leading
 to
 32
 Treatment
 Rec-
ommendations
 in
 the
 domains
 of
 early
 access
 and
 cardiac
 arrest
prevention,
 early,
 high-quality
 CPR,
 and
 early
 deﬁbrillation.
Cardiac
 arrest
Sudden
 cardiac
 arrest
 (SCA)
 is
 one
 of
 the
 leading
 causes
 of
 death
in
 Europe.
 On
 initial
 heart-rhythm
 analysis,
 about
 25–50%
 of
 SCA
victims
 have
 ventricular
 ﬁbrillation
 (VF)19–21 but
 when
 the
 rhythm
is
 recorded
 soon
 after
 collapse,
 in
 particular
 by
 an
 on-site
 AED,
 the
proportion
 of
 victims
 in
 VF
 can
 be
 as
 high
 as
 76%.22,23 The
 recom-
mended
 treatment
 for
 VF
 cardiac
 arrest
 is
 immediate
 bystander
CPR
 and
 early
 electrical
 deﬁbrillation.
 Most
 cardiac
 arrests
 of
 non-
cardiac
 origin
 have
 respiratory
 causes,
 such
 as
 drowning
 (among
them
 many
 children)
 and
 asphyxia.
 Rescue
 breaths
 as
 well
 as
 chest
compressions
 are
 critical
 for
 successful
 resuscitation
 of
 these
 vic-
tims.
The
 chain
 of
 survival
The
 Chain
 of
 Survival
 summarises
 the
 vital
 links
 needed
 for
 suc-
cessful
 resuscitation
 (Fig.
 1.2).
 Most
 of
 these
 links
 apply
 to
 victims
of
 both
 primary
 cardiac
 and
 asphyxial
 arrest.13
1:
 Early
 recognition
 and
 call
 for
 help
Recognising
 the
 cardiac
 origin
 of
 chest
 pain,
 and
 calling
 the
emergency
 services
 before
 a
 victim
 collapses,
 enables
 the
 emer-
gency
 medical
 service
 to
 arrive
 sooner,
 hopefully
 before
 cardiac
arrest
 has
 occurred,
 thus
 leading
 to
 better
 survival.24–26
Once
 cardiac
 arrest
 has
 occurred,
 early
 recognition
 is
 critical
to
 enable
 rapid
 activation
 of
 the
 EMS
 and
 prompt
 initiation
 of
bystander
 CPR.
 The
 key
 observations
 are
 unresponsiveness
 and
 not
breathing
 normally.
2:
 Early
 bystander
 CPR
The
 immediate
 initiation
 of
 CPR
 can
 double
 or
 quadruple
 sur-
vival
 after
 cardiac
 arrest.27–29 If
 able,
 bystanders
 with
 CPR
 training
should
 give
 chest
 compressions
 together
 with
 ventilations.
 When
 a
bystander
 has
 not
 been
 trained
 in
 CPR,
 the
 emergency
 medical
 dis-
patcher
 should
 instruct
 him
 or
 her
 to

Recognition
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
Recognising
 cardiac
 arrest
 can
 be
 challenging.
 Both
 bystanders
and
 emergency
 call
 handlers
 (emergency
 medical
 dispatchers)
have
 to
 diagnose
 cardiac
 arrest
 promptly
 in
 order
 to
 activate
the
 chain
 of
 survival.
 Checking
 the
 carotid
 pulse
 (or
 any
 other
pulse)
 has
 proved
 to
 be
 an
 inaccurate
 method
 for
 conﬁrming
 the
presence
 or
 absence
 of
 circulation.38–42 Agonal
 breathing
 may
 be
present
 in
 up
 to
 40%
 of
 victims
 in
 the
 ﬁrst
 minutes
 after
 cardiac
arrest,
 and
 if
 responded
 to
 as
 a
 sign
 of
 cardiac
 arrest,
 is
 associated
with
 higher
 survival
 rates.43 The
 signiﬁcance
 of
 agonal
 breath-
ing
 should
 be
 emphasised
 during
 basic
 life
 support
 training.44,45
Bystanders
 should
 suspect
 cardiac
 arrest
 and
 start
 CPR
 if
 the
 vic-
tim
 is
 unresponsive
 and
 not
 breathing
 normally.
 Bystanders
 should
be
 suspicious
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
 in
 any
 patient
 presenting
 with
seizures.46,47
Role
 of
 the
 emergency
 medical
 dispatcher
Dispatcher
 recognition
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
Patients
 who
 are
 unresponsive
 and
 not
 breathing
 normally
should
 be
 presumed
 to
 be
 in
 cardiac
 arrest.
 Agonal
 breathing
 is
often
 present,
 and
 callers
 may
 mistakenly
 believe
 the
 victim
 is
still
 breathing
 normally.48–57 Offering
 dispatchers
 additional
 edu-
cation,
 speciﬁcally
 addressing
 the
 identiﬁcation
 and
 signiﬁcance
 of
agonal
 breathing,
 can
 improve
 cardiac
 arrest
 recognition,
 increase
the
 provision
 of
 telephone-CPR,55,57 and
 reduce
 the
 number
 of
missed
 cardiac
 arrest
 cases.52
If
 the
 initial
 emergency
 call
 is
 for
 a
 person
 suffering
 seizures,
 the
call
 taker
 should
 be
 highly
 suspicious
 of
 cardiac
 arrest,
 even
 if
 the
caller
 reports
 that
 the
 victim
 has
 a
 prior
 history
 of
 epilepsy.49,58
Dispatcher-assisted
 CPR
Bystander
 CPR
 rates
 are
 low
 in
 many
 communities.
 Dispatcher-
assisted
 CPR
 (telephone-CPR)
 instructions
 improve
 bystander
CPR
 rates,56,59–62 reduce
 the
 time
 to
 ﬁrst
 CPR,57,59,62–64 increase
the
 number
 of
 chest
 compressions
 delivered60 and
 improve
patient
 outcomes
 following
 out-of-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
 (OHCA)
in
 all
 patient
 groups.30–32,56,61,63,65 Dispatchers
 should
 provide
telephone-CPR
 instructions
 in
 all
 cases
 of
 suspected
 cardiac
 arrest
unless
 a
 trained
 provider
 is
 already
 delivering
 CPR.
 Where
 instruc-
tions
 are
 required
 for
 an
 adult
 victim,
 dispatchers
 should
 provide
chest-compression-only
 CPR
 instructions.
 If
 the
 victim
 is
 a
 child,
dispatchers
 should
 instruct
 callers
 to
 provide
 both
 ventilations
 and
chest
 compressions.
Adult
 BLS
 sequence
Fig.
 1.3
 presents
 the
 step-by-step
 sequence
 for
 the
 trained
provider.
 It
 continues
 to
 highlight
 the
 importance
 of
 ensuring
 res-
cuer,
 victim
 and
 bystander
 safety.
 Calling
 for
 additional
 help
 (if
required)
 is
 incorporated
 in
 the
 alerting
 emergency
 services
 step
below.
 For
 clarity
 the
 algorithm
 is
 presented
 as
 a
 linear
 sequence
of
 steps.
 It
 is
 recognised
 that
 the
 early
 steps
 of
 checking
 response,
opening
 the
 airway,
 checking
 for
 breathing
 and
 calling
 the
 emer-
gency
 medical
 dispatcher
 may
 be
 accomplished
 simultaneously
 or
in
 rapid
 succession.
Those
 who
 are
 not
 trained
 to
 recognise
 cardiac
 arrest
 and
 start
CPR
 would
 not
 be
 aware
 of
 these
 guidelines
 and
 therefore
 require
dispatcher
 assistance
 whenever
 they
 make
 the
 decision
 to
 call
 112

Opening
 the

 and

The
 trained
 provider
 should
 assess
 the
 collapsed
 victim
 rapidly
to
 determine
 if
 they
 are
 responsive
 and
 breathing
 normally.
 Open
the
 airway
 using
 the
 head

 and

 technique
 whilst
assessing
 whether
 the
 person
 is

Alerting
 emergency
 services
112
 is
 the
 European
 emergency
 phone
 number,
 available
 every-
where
 in
 the
 EU,
 free
 of
 charge.
 It
 is
 possible
 to
 call
 112
 from
ﬁxed
 and
 mobile
 phones
 to
 contact
 any
 emergency
 service:
 an
ambulance,
 the
 ﬁre
 brigade
 or
 the
 police.
 Early
 contact
 with
 the
emergency
 services
 will
 facilitate
 dispatcher
 assistance
 in
 the
recognition
 of
 cardiac
 arrest,
 telephone
 instruction
 on
 how
 to
 per-
form
 CPR,
 emergency
 medical
 service/ﬁrst
 responder
 dispatch,
 and
on
 locating
 and
 dispatching
 of
 an
 AED.66–69
Starting
 chest
 compressions
In
 adults
 needing
 CPR,
 there
 is
 a
 high
 probability
 of
 a
 primary
cardiac
 cause.
 When
 blood
 ﬂow
 stops
 after
 cardiac
 arrest,
 the
 blood
in
 the
 lungs
 and
 arterial
 system
 remains
 oxygenated
 for
 some
minutes.
 To
 emphasise
 the
 priority
 of
 chest
 compressions,
 it
 is
 rec-
ommended
 that
 CPR
 should
 start
 with
 chest
 compressions
 rather
than
 initial
 ventilations.
When
 providing
 manual
 chest
 compressions:
1.
 Deliver
 compressions
 ‘in
 the
 centre
 of
 the
 chest’
2.
 Compress
 to
 a
 depth
 of
 at
 least
 5
 cm
 but
 not
 more
 than
 6
 cm
3.
 Compress
 the
 chest
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 100–120
 min−1 with
 as
 few
 inter-
ruptions
 as
 possible
4.
 Allow
 the
 chest
 to
 recoil
 completely
 after
 each
 compression;
 do
not
 lean
 on
 the
 chest
Hand
 position
Experimental
 studies
 show
 better

sternum.70–72 It
 is
 recommended
 that
 this
 location
 be
 taught
 in
 a
simpliﬁed
 way,
 such
 as,
 “place
 the
 heel
 of
 your
 hand
 in
 the
 centre
of
 the
 chest
 with
 the
 other
 hand
 on
 top”.
 This
 instruction
 should
 be
accompanied
 by
 a
 demonstration
 of
 placing
 the
 hands
 on
 the
 lower
half
 of
 the
 sternum.73,74
Chest
 compressions
 are
 most
 easily
 delivered
 by
 a
 single
 CPR
provider
 kneeling
 by
 the
 side
 of
 the
 victim,
 as
 this
 facilitates
movement
 between
 compressions
 and
 ventilations
 with
 minimal
interruptions.
 Over-the-head
 CPR
 for
 single
 CPR
 providers
 and
straddle-CPR
 for
 two
 CPR
 providers
 may
 be
 considered
 when
 it
 is
not
 possible
 to
 perform
 compressions
 from
 the
 side,
 for
 example
when
 the
 victim
 is
 in
 a
 conﬁned
 space.75,76
Compression
 depth
Data
 from
 four
 recent
 observational
 studies
 suggest
 that
 a
compression
 depth
 range
 of
 4.5–5.5
 cm
 in
 adults
 leads
 to
 bet-
ter
 outcomes
 than
 all
 other
 compression
 depths
 during
 manual
CPR.77–80 One
 of
 these
 studies
 found
 that
 a
 compression
 depth
 of
46
 mm was
 associated
 with
 the
 highest
 survival
 rate.79 The
 ERC,
therefore,
 endorses
 the
 ILCOR
 recommendation
 that
 it
 is
 reason-
able
 to
 aim
 for
 a
 chest
 compression
 depth
 of
 approximately
 5
 cm
but
 not
 more
 than
 6
 cm
 in
 the
 average
 sized
 adult.81 In
 line
 with
the
 ILCOR
 recommendation,
 the
 ERC
 decided
 to
 retain
 the
 2010
guidance
 to
 compress
 the
 chest
 at
 least
 5
 cm
 but
 not
 more
 than
6
 cm.
Compression
 rate
Two
 studies
 found
 higher
 survival
 among
 patients
 who
 received
chest
 compressions
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 100–120
 min−1. Very
 high
 chest
compression
 rates
 were
 associated
 with
 declining
 chest
 com-
pression
 depths.82,83 The
 ERC
 recommends,
 therefore,
 that
 chest
compressions
 should
 be
 performed
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 100–120
 min−1.
Minimising
 pauses
 in
 chest
 compressions
Pre-
 and
 post-shock
 pauses
 of
 less
 than
 10
 s,
 and
 chest
 compres-
sion
 fractions
 >60%
 are
 associated
 with
 improved
 outcomes.84–88
Pauses
 in
 chest
 compressions
 should
 be
 minimised.
Firm
 surface
CPR
 should
 be
 performed
 on
 a
 ﬁrm
 surface
 whenever
 possi-
ble.
 Air-ﬁlled
 mattresses
 should
 be
 routinely
 deﬂated
 during
 CPR.89
The
 evidence
 for
 the
 use
 of
 backboards
 is
 equivocal.90–94 If
 a
 back-
board
 is
 used,
 take
 care
 to
 avoid
 interrupting
 CPR
 and
 dislodging
intravenous
 lines
 or
 other
 tubes
 during
 board
 placement.
Chest
 wall
 recoil
Allowing
 complete
 recoil
 of
 the
 chest
 after
 each
 compression
results
 in
 better
 venous
 return
 to
 the
 chest
 and
 may
 improve
 the
effectiveness
 of
 CPR.95–98 CPR
 providers
 should,
 therefore,
 take
 care
to
 avoid
 leaning
 after
 each
 chest
 compression.
Duty
 cycle
There
 is
 very
 little
 evidence
 to
 recommend
 any
 speciﬁc
 duty
cycle
 and,
 therefore,
 insufﬁcient
 new
 evidence
 to
 prompt
 a
 change
from
 the
 currently
 recommended
 ratio
 of
 50%.
Feedback
 on
 compression
 technique
None
 of
 the
 studies
 on
 feedback
 or
 prompt
 devices
 has
 demon-
strated
 improved
 survival
 to
 discharge
 with
 feedback.99 The
 use
 of
CPR
 feedback
 or
 prompt
 devices
 during
 CPR
 should
 only
 be
 con-
sidered
 as
 part
 of
 a
 broader
 system
 of
 care
 that
 should
 include
comprehensive
 CPR
 quality
 improvement
 initiatives,99,100 rather
than
 as
 an
 isolated
 intervention.

Rescue
 breaths
We  suggest
 that
 during
 adult
 CPR
 tidal
 volumes
 of
 approx-
imately
 500–600
 ml
 (6–7
 ml
 kg−1) are
 delivered.
 Practically,
 this
is
 the
 volume
 required
 to
 cause
 the
 chest
 to
 rise
 visibly.101 CPR
providers
 should
 aim
 for
 an
 inﬂation
 duration
 of
 about
 1
 s,
 with
enough
 volume
 to
 make
 the
 victim’s
 chest
 rise,
 but
 avoid
 rapid
 or
forceful
 breaths.
 The
 maximum
 interruption
 in
 chest
 compression
to
 give
 two
 breaths
 should
 not
 exceed
 10
 s.102
Compression–ventilation
 ratio
A
 ratio
 of
 30:2
 was
 recommended
 in
 ERC
 Guidelines
 2010
for
 the
 single
 CPR
 provider
 attempting
 resuscitation
 of
 an
 adult.
Several
 observational
 studies
 have
 reported
 slightly
 improved
outcomes
 after
 implementation
 of
 the
 guideline
 changes,
 which
included
 switching
 from
 a
 compression
 ventilation
 ratio
 of
 15:2
 to
30:2.103–106 The
 ERC
 continues,
 therefore,
 to
 recommend
 a
 com-
pression
 to
 ventilation
 ratio
 of
 30:2.
Compression-only
 CPR
Observational
 studies,
 classiﬁed
 mostly
 as
 very
 low-quality
 evi-
dence,
 have
 suggested
 equivalence
 of
 chest-compression-only
 CPR
and
 chest
 compressions
 combined
 with
 rescue
 breaths
 in
 adults
with
 a
 suspected
 cardiac
 cause
 for
 their
 cardiac
 arrest.27,107–118
Our
 conﬁdence
 in
 the
 equivalence
 between
 chest-compression-
only
 and
 standard
 CPR
 is
 not
 sufﬁcient
 to
 change
 current
 practice.
The
 ERC,
 therefore,
 endorses
 the
 ILCOR
 recommendations
 that
 all
CPR
 providers
 should
 perform
 chest
 compressions
 for
 all
 patients
in
 cardiac
 arrest.
 CPR
 providers
 trained
 and
 able
 to
 perform
 res-
cue
 breaths
 should
 perform
 chest
 compressions
 and
 rescue
 breaths
as
 this
 may
 provide
 additional
 beneﬁt
 for
 children
 and
 those
 who
sustain
 an
 asphyxial
 cardiac
 arrest111,119,120 or
 where
 the
 EMS
response
 interval
 is
 prolonged.115
Use
 of
 an
 automated
 external
 deﬁbrillator
AEDs
 are
 safe
 and
 effective
 when
 used
 by
 laypeople
 with
 min-
imal
 or
 no
 training.121 AEDs
 make
 it
 possible
 to
 deﬁbrillate
 many
minutes
 before
 professional
 help
 arrives.
 CPR
 providers
 should
 con-
tinue
 CPR
 with
 minimal
 interruption
 of
 chest
 compressions
 while
attaching
 an
 AED
 and
 during
 its
 use.
 CPR
 providers
 should
 con-
centrate
 on
 following
 the
 voice
 prompts
 immediately
 when
 they
are
 spoken,
 in
 particular
 resuming
 CPR
 as
 soon
 as
 instructed,
 and
minimising
 interruptions
 in
 chest
 compression.
 Standard
 AEDs
 are
suitable
 for
 use
 in
 children
 older
 than
 8
 years.122–124 For
 children
between
 1
 and
 8
 years
 use
 paediatric
 pads,
 together
 with
 an
 atten-
uator
 or
 a
 paediatric
 mode
 if
 available.
CPR
 before
 deﬁbrillation
Continue
 CPR
 while
 a
 deﬁbrillator
 or
 AED
 is
 being
 brought
 on-
site
 and
 applied,
 but
 deﬁbrillation
 should
 not
 be
 delayed
 any
 longer.
Interval
 between
 rhythm
 checks
Pause
 chest
 compressions
 every
 2
 min
 to
 assess
 the
 cardiac
rhythm.
Voice
 prompts
It
 is
 critically
 important
 that
 CPR
 providers
 pay
 attention
 to
AED
 voice
 prompts
 and
 follow
 them
 without
 any
 delay.
 Voice
prompts
 are
 usually
 programmable,
 and
 it
 is
 recommended
 that
they
 be
 set
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 sequence
 of
 shocks
 and
 timings
for
 CPR
 given
 above.
 Devices
 measuring
 CPR
 quality
 may
 in
 addi-
tion
 provide
 real-time
 CPR
 feedback
 and
 supplemental
 voice/visual
prompts.
In
 practice,
 AEDs
 are
 used
 mostly
 by
 trained
 rescuers,
 where
the
 default
 setting
 of
 AED
 prompts
 should
 be
 for
 a
 compression
 to
ventilation
 ratio
 of
 30:2.
 If
 (in
 an
 exception)
 AEDs
 are
 placed
 in
 a
setting
 where
 such
 trained
 rescuers
 are
 unlikely
 to
 be
 available
 or
present,
 the
 owner
 or
 distributor
 may
 choose
 to
 change
 the
 settings
to
 compression
 only.
Public
 access
 deﬁbrillation
 (PAD)
 programmes
Placement
 of
 AEDs
 in
 areas
 where
 one
 cardiac
 arrest
 per
 5
 years
can
 be
 expected
 is
 considered
 cost-effective
 and
 comparable
 to
other
 medical
 interventions.125–127 Registration
 of
 AEDs
 for
 public
access,
 so
 that
 dispatchers
 can
 direct
 CPR
 providers
 to
 a
 nearby
 AED,
may
 also
 help
 to
 optimise
 response.128 The
 effectiveness
 of
 AED
 use
for
 victims
 at
 home
 is
 limited.129 The
 proportion
 of
 patients
 found
in
 VF
 is
 lower
 at
 home
 than
 in
 public
 places,
 however
 the
 absolute
number
 of
 potentially
 treatable
 patients
 is
 higher
 at
 home.129 Pub-
lic
 access
 deﬁbrillation
 (PAD)
 rarely
 reaches
 victims
 at
 home.130
Dispatched
 lay
 CPR
 providers,
 local
 to
 the
 victim
 and
 directed
 to
 a
nearby
 AED,
 may
 improve
 bystander
 CPR
 rates33 and
 help
 reduce
the
 time
 to
 deﬁbrillation.37
Universal
 AED
 signage
ILCOR
 has
 designed
 a
 simple
 and
 clear
 AED
 sign
 that
 may
 be
recognised
 worldwide
 and
 this
 is
 recommended
 to
 indicate
 the
location
 of
 an
 AED.131
In-hospital
 use
 of
 AEDs
There
 are
 no
 published
 randomised
 trials
 comparing
 in-hospital
use
 of
 AEDs
 with
 manual
 deﬁbrillators.
 Three
 observational
 studies
showed
 no
 improvements
 in
 survival
 to
 hospital
 discharge
 for
 in-
hospital
 adult
 cardiac
 arrest
 when
 using
 an
 AED
 compared
 with
manual
 deﬁbrillation.132–134 Another
 large
 observational
 study
showed
 that
 in-hospital
 AED
 use
 was
 associated
 with
 a
 lower
survival-to-discharge
 rate
 compared
 with
 no
 AED
 use.135 This
 sug-
gests
 that
 AEDs
 may
 cause
 harmful
 delays
 in
 starting
 CPR,
 or
interruptions
 in
 chest
 compressions
 in
 patients
 with
 non-shockable
rhythms.136 We  recommend
 the
 use
 of
 AEDs
 in
 those
 areas
 of
 the
hospital
 where
 there
 is
 a
 risk
 of
 delayed
 deﬁbrillation,137 because
 it
will
 take
 several
 minutes
 for
 a
 resuscitation
 team
 to
 arrive,
 and
 ﬁrst
responders
 do
 not
 have
 skills
 in
 manual
 deﬁbrillation.
 The
 goal
 is
to
 attempt
 deﬁbrillation
 within
 3
 min
 of
 collapse.
 In
 hospital
 areas
where
 there
 is
 rapid
 access
 to
 manual
 deﬁbrillation,
 either
 from
trained
 staff
 or
 a
 resuscitation
 team,
 manual
 deﬁbrillation
 should
be

Risks
 to
 the
 CPR
 provider
 and
 recipients
 of
 CPR
In
 victims
 who
 are
 eventually
 found
 not
 to
 be
 in
 cardiac
arrest,
 bystander
 CPR
 extremely
 rarely
 leads
 to
 serious
 harm.
 CPR
providers
 should
 not,
 therefore,
 be
 reluctant
 to
 initiate
 CPR
 because
of
 concern
 of
 causing
 harm.
Foreign
 body
 airway
 obstruction
 (choking)
Foreign
 body
 airway
 obstruction
 (FBAO)
 is
 an
 uncommon
 but
potentially
 treatable
 cause
 of
 accidental
 death.138 As
 victims
 ini-
tially
 are
 conscious
 and
 responsive,
 there
 are
 often
 opportunities
for
 early
 interventions
 which
 can
 be
 life
 saving.

Recognition
FBAO
 usually
 occurs
 while
 the
 victim
 is
 eating
 or
 drinking.
Fig.
 1.5
 presents
 the
 treatment
 algorithm
 for
 the
 adult
 with
 FBAO.
Foreign
 bodies
 may
 cause
 either
 mild
 or
 severe
 obstruction.
 It
 is
important
 to
 ask
 the
 conscious
 victim
 “Are
 you
 choking?”.
 The
 vic-
tim
 that
 is
 able
 to
 speak,
 cough
 and
 breathe
 has
 mild
 obstruction.
The
 victim
 that
 is
 unable
 to
 speak,
 has
 a
 weakening
 cough,
 is
 strug-
gling
 or
 unable
 to
 breathe,
 has
 severe
 airway
 obstruction.
Treatment
 for
 mild
 airway
 obstruction
Encourage
 the
 victim
 to
 cough
 as
 coughing
 generates
 high
 and
sustained
 airway
 pressures
 and
 may
 expel
 the
 foreign
 body.

Treatment
 for
 severe
 airway
 obstruction
For
 conscious
 adults
 and
 children
 over
 one
 year
 of
 age
 with
 com-
plete
 FBAO,
 case
 reports
 have
 demonstrated
 the
 effectiveness
 of
back
 blows
 or
 ‘slaps’,
 abdominal
 thrusts
 and
 chest
 thrusts.139 The
likelihood
 of
 success
 is
 increased
 when
 combinations
 of
 back
 blows
or
 slaps,
 and
 abdominal
 and
 chest
 thrusts
 are
 used.139
Treatment
 of
 foreign
 body
 airway
 obstruction
 in
 an
 unresponsive
victim
A
 randomised
 trial
 in
 cadavers140 and
 two
 prospective
 stud-
ies
 in
 anaesthetised
 volunteers141,142 showed
 that
 higher
 airway
pressures
 can
 be
 generated
 using
 chest
 thrusts
 compared
 with
abdominal
 thrusts.
 Chest
 compressions
 should,
 therefore,
 be
started
 promptly
 if
 the
 victim
 becomes
 unresponsive
 or
 uncon-
scious.
 After
 30
 compressions
 attempt
 2
 rescue
 breaths,
 and
continue
 CPR
 until
 the
 victim
 recovers
 and
 starts
 to
 breathe
 nor-
mally.
Victims
 with
 a
 persistent
 cough,
 difﬁculty
 swallowing
 or
 the
sensation
 of
 an
 object
 being
 still
 stuck
 in
 the
 throat
 should
 be
referred
 for
 a
 medical
 opinion.
 Abdominal
 thrusts
 and
 chest
 com-
pressions
 can
 potentially
 cause
 serious
 internal
 injuries
 and
 all
victims
 successfully
 treated
 with
 these
 measures
 should
 be
 exam-
ined
 afterwards
 for
 injury.
Resuscitation
 of
 children
 (see
 also
 section
 6)
 and
 victims
 of
drowning
 (see
 also
 section
 4)
Many
 children
 do
 not
 receive
 resuscitation
 because
 potential
CPR
 providers
 fear
 causing
 harm
 if
 they
 are
 not
 speciﬁcally
 trained
in
 resuscitation
 for
 children.
 This
 fear
 is
 unfounded:
 it
 is
 far
 better
to
 use
 the
 adult
 BLS
 sequence
 for
 resuscitation
 of
 a
 child
 than
 to
do
 nothing.
 For
 ease
 of
 teaching
 and
 retention,
 laypeople
 should
be
 taught
 that
 the
 adult
 sequence
 may
 also
 be
 used
 for
 children
who
 are
 not
 responsive
 and
 not
 breathing
 normally.
 The
 following
minor
 modiﬁcations
 to
 the
 adult
 sequence
 will
 make
 it
 even
 more
suitable
 for
 use
 in
 children:
• Give
 5
 initial
 rescue
 breaths
 before
 starting
 chest
 compressions
• Give
 CPR
 for
 1
 min
 before
 going
 for
 help
 in
 the
 unlikely
 event
 the
CPR
 provider
 is
 alone
• Compress
 the
 chest
 by
 at
 least
 one
 third
 of
 its
 depth;
 use
 2
 ﬁngers
for
 an
 infant
 under
 one
 year;
 use
 1
 or
 2
 hands
 for
 a
 child
 over
 1
year
 as
 needed
 to
 achieve
 an
 adequate
 depth
 of
 compression
The
 same
 modiﬁcations
 of
 5
 initial
 breaths
 and
 1
 min
 of
 CPR
 by
the
 lone
 CPR
 provider
 before
 getting
 help,
 may
 improve
 outcome
for
 victims
 of
 drowning.
 This
 modiﬁcation
 should
 be
 taught
 only
to
 those
 who
 have
 a
 speciﬁc
 duty
 of
 care
 to
 potential
 drowning
victims
 (e.g.
 lifeguards).

Guidelines
 for
 prevention
 of
 in-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
Early
 recognition
 of
 the
 deteriorating
 patient
 and
 prevention
 of
cardiac
 arrest
 is
 the
 ﬁrst
 link
 in
 the
 chain
 of
 survival.13 Once
 cardiac
arrest
 occurs,
 only
 about
 20%
 of
 patients
 who
 have
 an
 in-hospital
cardiac
 arrest
 will
 survive
 to
 go
 home.143,144 Hospitals
 should
provide
 a
 system
 of
 care
 that
 includes:
 (a)
 educating
 staff
 about
 the
signs
 of
 patient
 deterioration
 and
 the
 rationale
 for
 rapid
 response
 to
illness,
 (b)
 appropriate,
 and
 frequent
 monitoring
 of
 patients’
 vital
signs,
 (c)
 clear
 guidance
 (e.g.
 via
 calling
 criteria
 or
 early
 warning
scores)
 to
 assist
 staff
 in
 the
 early
 detection
 of
 patient
 deteriora-
tion,
 (d)
 a
 clear,
 uniform
 system
 of
 calling
 for
 assistance,
 and
 (e)
 an
appropriate
 and
 timely
 clinical
 response
 to
 calls
 for
 help.145
Prevention
 of
 sudden
 cardiac
 death
 (SCD)
 out-of-hospital
Most
 SCD
 victims
 have
 a
 history
 of
 cardiac
 disease
 and
warning
 signs,
 most
 commonly
 chest
 pain,
 in
 the
 hour
 before
cardiac
 arrest.146 Apparently
 healthy
 children
 and
 young
 adults
who
 
suffer
 
SCD
 
can
 
also
 
have
 
signs
 
and
 
symptoms
 
(e.g.
syncope/pre-syncope,
 chest
 pain
 and
 palpitations)
 that
 should
 alert
healthcare
 professionals
 to
 seek
 expert
 help
 to
 prevent
 cardiac
arrest.147–151 Screening
 programmes
 for
 athletes
 vary
 between
countries.152,153 Identiﬁcation
 of
 individuals
 with
 inherited
 con-
ditions
 and
 screening
 of
 family
 members
 can
 help
 prevent
 deaths
in
 young
 people
 with
 inherited
 heart
 disorders.154–156
Prehospital
 resuscitation
CPR
 versus
 deﬁbrillation
 ﬁrst
 for
 out-of-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
EMS
 personnel
 should
 provide
 high-quality
 CPR
 while
 a
 deﬁbril-
lator
 is
 retrieved,
 applied
 and
 charged.
 Deﬁbrillation
 should
 not
 be
delayed
 longer
 than
 needed
 to
 establish
 the
 need
 for
 deﬁbrillation
and
 charging.
Termination
 of
 resuscitation
 rules
The
 ‘basic
 life
 support
 termination
 of
 resuscitation
 rule’
 is
 pre-
dictive
 of
 death
 when
 applied
 by
 deﬁbrillation-only
 emergency
medical
 technicians.157 The
 rule
 recommends
 termination
 when
there
 is
 no
 ROSC,
 no
 shocks
 are
 administered
 and
 EMS
 personnel
did
 not
 witness
 the
 arrest.
 Several
 studies
 have
 shown
 external
generalisability
 of
 this
 rule.158–164 More
 recent
 studies
 show
 that
EMS
 systems
 providing
 ALS
 interventions
 can
 also
 use
 this
 BLS
 rule
and
 therefore
 termed
 it
 the
 ‘universal’
 termination
 of
 resuscitation
rule.159,165,166
In-hospital
 resuscitation
After
 in-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest,
 the
 division
 between
 BLS
and
 ALS
 is
 arbitrary;

 practice,

 process
 is

 is
 common
 in

 already)
Turn
 the
 victim
 on
 to
 his
 back
 and
 then
 open
 the
 airway:
• Open
 airway
 and
 check
 breathing:
◦
 Open
 the
 airway
 using
 a
 head
 tilt
 chin
 lift
◦ Keeping
 the
 airway
 open,
 look,
 listen
 and
 feel
 for
 normal
breathing
 (an
 occasional
 gasp,
 slow,
 laboured
 or
 noisy
 breath-
ing
 is
 not
 normal):
• Look
 for
 chest
 movement
• Listen
 at
 the
 victim’s
 mouth
 for
 breath
 sounds
• Feel
 for
 air
 on
 your
 cheek
• Look,
 listen
 and
 feel
 for
 no
 more
 than
 10
 seconds
 to
 determine
 if
the
 victim
 is
 breathing
 normally.
• Check
 for
 signs
 of
 a
 circulation:
◦
 It
 may
 be
 difﬁcult
 to
 be
 certain
 that
 there
 is
 no
 pulse.
 If
 the
patient
 has
 no
 signs
 of
 life
 (consciousness,
 purposeful
 move-
ment,
 normal
 breathing,
 or
 coughing),
 or
 if
 there
 is
 doubt,
 start
CPR
 immediately
 until
 more
 experienced
 help
 arrives
 or
 the
patient
 shows
 signs
 of
 life.
◦
 Delivering
 chest
 compressions
 to
 a
 patient
 with
 a
 beating
 heart
is
 unlikely
 to
 cause
 harm.173 However,
 delays
 in
 diagnosing
 car-
diac
 arrest
 and
 starting
 CPR
 will
 adversely
 effect
 survival
 and
must
 be
 avoided.
◦
 Only
 those
 experienced
 in
 ALS
 should
 try
 to
 assess
 the
 carotid
pulse
 whilst
 simultaneously
 looking
 for
 signs
 of
 life.
 This
 rapid
assessment
 should
 take
 no
 more
 than
 10
 s.
 Start
 CPR
 if
 there
 is
any
 doubt
 about
 the
 presence
 or
 absence
 of
 a
 pulse.
• If
 there
 are
 signs
 of
 life,
 urgent
 medical
 assessment
 is
 required.
Depending
 on
 the
 local
 protocols,
 this
 may
 take
 the
 form
 of
 a
resuscitation
 team.
 While
 awaiting
 this
 team,
 give
 the
 patient

 cannula.
When
 a
 reliable
 measurement
 of
 oxygen
 saturation
 of
 arterial
blood
 (e.g.
 pulse
 oximetry
 (SpO2))
 can
 be
 achieved,
 titrate
 the

 concentration
 to
 achieve
 a
 SpO2
 of
 94–98%.
• If
 there
 is
 no
 breathing,
 but
 there
 is
 a
 pulse
 (respiratory
 arrest),
ventilate
 the
 patient’s
 lungs
 and
 check
 for
 a

 every
 10
breaths.
 Start

 if
 there
 is
 any
 doubt
 about
 the
 presence
 or
absence
 of
 a

Starting
 in-hospital
 CPR
The
 key
 steps
 are
 listed
 here.
 Supporting
 evidence
 can
 be
 found
in
 the
 sections
 on
 speciﬁc
 interventions
 that
 follow.
• One
 person
 starts
 CPR
 as
 others
 call
 the
 resuscitation
 team
and
 collect
 the
 resuscitation
 equipment
 and
 a
 deﬁbrillator.
 If
only
 one
 member
 of
 staff
 is
 present,
 this
 will
 mean
 leaving
 the
patient.
• Give
 30
 chest
 compressions
 followed
 by
 2
 ventilations.
• Compress
 to
 a
 depth
 of
 at
 least
 5
 cm
 but
 no
 more
 than
 6
 cm.
• Chest
 
compressions
 
should
 
be
 
performed
 
at
 
a
 
rate
 
of
100–120
 min−1.
• Allow
 the
 chest
 to
 recoil
 completely
 after
 each
 compression;
 do
not
 lean
 on
 the
 chest.
• Minimise
 interruptions
 and
 ensure
 high-quality
 compressions.
• Undertaking
 high-quality
 chest
 compressions
 for
 a
 prolonged
time
 is
 tiring;
 with
 minimal
 interruption,
 try
 to
 change
 the
 person
doing
 chest
 compressions
 every
 2
 min.
• Maintain
 the
 airway
 and
 ventilate
 the
 lungs
 with
 the
 most
 appro-
priate
 equipment
 immediately
 to
 hand.
 Pocket
 mask
 ventilation
or
 two-rescuer
 bag-mask
 ventilation,
 which
 can
 be
 supple-
mented
 with
 an
 oral
 airway,
 should
 be
 started.
 Alternatively,
 use
a
 supraglottic
 airway
 device
 (SGA)
 and
 self-inﬂating
 bag.
 Tracheal
intubation
 should
 be
 attempted
 only
 by
 those
 who
 are
 trained,
competent
 and
 experienced
 in
 this
 skill.
• Waveform
 capnography
 must
 be
 used
 for
 conﬁrming
 tracheal
tube
 placement
 and
 monitoring
 ventilation
 rate.
 Waveform
capnography
 can
 also
 be
 used
 with
 a
 bag-mask
 device
 and
 SGA.
The
 further
 use
 of
 waveform
 capnography
 to
 monitor
 CPR
 quality
and
 potentially
 identify
 ROSC
 during
 CPR
 is
 discussed
 later
 in
 this
section.174
• Use
 an
 inspiratory
 time
 of
 1
 s
 and
 give
 enough
 volume
 to
 produce
a
 normal
 chest
 rise.
 Add
 supplemental
 oxygen
 to
 give
 the
 highest
feasible
 inspired
 oxygen
 as
 soon
 as
 possible.175
• Once
 the
 patient’s
 trachea
 has
 been
 intubated
 or
 a
 SGA
 has
 been
inserted,
 continue
 uninterrupted
 chest
 compressions
 (except
for
 deﬁbrillation
 or
 pulse
 checks
 when
 indicated)
 at
 a
 rate
 of
100–120
 min−1 and
 ventilate
 the
 lungs
 at
 approximately
 10
breaths
 min−1. Avoid
 hyperventilation
 (both
 excessive
 rate
 and
tidal
 volume).
• If
 there
 is
 no
 airway
 and
 ventilation
 equipment
 available,
 con-
sider
 giving
 mouth-to-mouth
 ventilation.
 If
 there
 are
 clinical
reasons
 to
 avoid
 mouth-to-mouth
 contact,
 or
 you
 are
 unable
 to
do
 this,
 do
 chest
 compressions
 until
 help
 or
 airway
 equipment
arrives.
• When
 the
 deﬁbrillator
 arrives,
 apply
 self-adhesive
 deﬁbrillation
pads
 to
 the
 patient
 whilst
 chest
 compressions
 continue
 and
 then
brieﬂy
 analyse
 the
 rhythm.
 If
 self-adhesive
 deﬁbrillation
 pads
are
 not
 available,
 use
 paddles.
 Pause
 brieﬂy
 to
 assess
 the
 heart
rhythm.
 With
 a
 manual
 deﬁbrillator,
 if
 the
 rhythm
 is
 VF/pVT
charge
 the
 deﬁbrillator
 while
 another
 rescuer
 continues
 chest
compressions.
 Once
 the
 deﬁbrillator
 is
 charged,
 pause
 the
 chest
compressions
 and
 then
 give
 one
 shock,
 and
 immediately
 resume
chest
 compressions.
 Ensure
 no
 one
 is
 touching
 the
 patient
 dur-
ing
 shock
 delivery.
 Plan
 and
 ensure
 safe
 deﬁbrillation
 before
 the
planned
 pause
 in
 chest
 compressions.
• If
 using
 an
 automated
 external
 deﬁbrillator
 (AED)
 follow
the
 AED’s
 audio-visual
 prompts,
 and
 similarly
 aim
 to
 min-
imise
 
pauses
 
in
 
chest
 
compressions
 
by
 
rapidly
 
following
prompts.
• In
 some
 settings
 where
 self-adhesive
 deﬁbrillation
 pads
 are
 not
available,
 alternative
 deﬁbrillation
 strategies
 using
 paddles
 are
used
 to
 minimise
 the
 preshock
 pause.
• In
 some
 countries
 a
 deﬁbrillation
 strategy
 that
 involves
 charging
the
 deﬁbrillator
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 every
 2
 min
 cycle
 of
 CPR
 in
preparation
 for
 the
 pulse
 check
 is
 used.176,177 If
 the
 rhythm
 is
VF/pVT
 a
 shock
 is
 given
 and
 CPR
 resumed.
 Whether
 this
 leads
 to
any
 beneﬁt
 is
 unknown,
 but
 it
 does
 lead
 to
 deﬁbrillator
 charging
for
 non-shockable
 rhythms.
• Restart
 chest
 compressions
 immediately
 after
 the
 deﬁbrillation
attempt.
 Minimise
 interruptions
 to
 chest
 compressions.
 When
using
 a
 manual
 deﬁbrillator
 it
 is
 possible
 to
 reduce
 the
 pause
between
 stopping
 and
 restarting
 of
 chest
 compressions
 to
 less
than
 ﬁve
 seconds.
• Continue
 resuscitation
 until
 the
 resuscitation
 team
 arrives
 or
 the
patient
 shows
 signs
 of
 life.
 Follow
 the
 voice
 prompts
 if
 using
 an
AED.
• Once
 resuscitation
 is
 underway,
 and
 if
 there
 are
 sufﬁcient
 staff
present,
 prepare
 intravenous
 cannulae
 and
 drugs
 likely
 to
 be
 used
by
 the
 resuscitation
 team
 (e.g.
 adrenaline).
• Identify
 one
 person
 to
 be
 responsible
 for
 handover
 to
 the
resuscitation
 team
 leader.
 Use
 a
 structured
 communication
tool
 for
 handover

• The
 quality
 of
 chest
 compressions
 during
 in-hospital
 CPR
 is
frequently
 sub-optimal.180,181 The
 importance
 of
 uninterrupted
chest
 compressions
 cannot
 be
 over
 emphasised.
 Even
 short
 inter-
ruptions
 to
 chest
 compressions
 are
 disastrous
 for
 outcome
 and
every
 effort
 must
 be
 made
 to
 ensure
 that
 continuous,
 effective
chest
 compression
 is
 maintained
 throughout
 the
 resuscitation
attempt.
 Chest
 compressions
 should
 commence
 at
 the
 beginning
of
 a
 resuscitation
 attempt
 and
 continue
 uninterrupted
 unless
they
 are
 paused
 brieﬂy
 for

 Most
 interventions
 can
 be
 performed
 without
 interrup-
tions
 to
 chest
 compressions.
 The
 team
 leader
 should
 monitor
 the
quality
 of
 CPR
 and
 alternate
 CPR
 providers
 if
 the
 quality
 of
 CPR
 is
poor.
• Continuous
 EtCO2 monitoring
 during
 CPR
 can
 be
 used
 to
 indicate
the
 quality
 of
 CPR,
 and
 a
 rise
 in
 EtCO2 can
 be
 an
 indicator
 of
 ROSC
during
 chest
 compressions.174,182–184
• If
 possible,
 the
 person
 providing
 chest
 compressions
 should
 be
changed
 every
 2
 min,
 but
 without
 pauses
 in
 chest
 compressions.
ALS
 treatment
 algorithm
Although
 the
 ALS
 cardiac
 arrest
 algorithm
 (Fig.
 1.7)
 is
 applicable
to
 all
 cardiac
 arrests,
 additional
 interventions
 may
 be
 indicated
 for
cardiac
 arrest
 caused
 by
 special
 circumstances
 (see
 Section
 4).3
The
 interventions
 that
 unquestionably
 contribute
 to
 improved
survival
 after
 cardiac
 arrest
 are
 prompt
 and
 effective
 bystander
basic
 life
 support
 (BLS),
 uninterrupted,
 high-quality
 chest
 com-
pressions
 and
 early
 deﬁbrillation
 for
 VF/pVT.
 The
 use
 of
 adrenaline
has
 been
 shown
 to
 increase
 ROSC
 but
 not
 survival
 to
 discharge.
Furthermore
 there
 is
 a
 possibility
 that
 it
 causes
 worse
 long-
term
 neurological
 survival.
 Similarly,
 the
 evidence
 to
 support
the
 use
 of
 advanced
 airway
 interventions
 during
 ALS
 remains
limited.175,185–192 Thus,
 although
 drugs
 and
 advanced
 airways
 are
still
 included
 among
 ALS
 interventions,
 they
 are
 of
 secondary
importance
 to
 early
 deﬁbrillation
 and
 high-quality,
 uninterrupted
chest
 compressions.
As with
 previous
 guidelines,
 the
 ALS
 algorithm
 distinguishes
between
 shockable
 and
 non-shockable
 rhythms.
 Each
 cycle
 is
broadly
 similar,
 with
 a
 total
 of
 2
 min
 of
 CPR
 being
 given
 before
assessing
 the
 rhythm
 and
 where
 indicated,
 feeling
 for
 a
 pulse.
Adrenaline
 1
 mg  is
 injected
 every
 3–5
 min
 until
 ROSC
 is
 achieved
–
 the
 timing
 of
 the
 initial
 dose
 of
 adrenaline
 is
 described
 below.
In
 VF/pVT,
 a
 single
 dose
 of
 amiodarone
 300
 mg
 is
 indicated
 after
 a
total
 of
 three
 shocks
 and
 a
 further
 dose
 of
 150
 mg
 can
 be
 consid-
ered
 after
 ﬁve
 shocks.
 The
 optimal
 CPR
 cycle
 time
 is
 not
 known
 and
algorithms
 for
 longer
 cycles
 (3
 min)
 exist
 which
 include
 different
timings
 for
 adrenaline
 doses.193
Shockable
 rhythms
 (ventricular
 ﬁbrillation/pulseless
 ventricular
tachycardia)
Having
 conﬁrmed
 cardiac
 arrest,
 summon
 help
 (including
 the
request
 for
 a
 deﬁbrillator)
 and
 start
 CPR,
 beginning
 with
 chest
compressions,
 with
 a
 compression:
 ventilation
 (CV)
 ratio
 of
 30:2.
When
 the
 deﬁbrillator
 arrives,
 continue
 chest
 compressions
 while
applying
 the
 deﬁbrillation
 electrodes.
 Identify
 the
 rhythm
 and
 treat
according
 to
 the
 ALS
 algorithm.
• If
 VF/pVT
 is
 conﬁrmed,
 charge
 the
 deﬁbrillator
 while
 another
rescuer
 continues
 chest
 compressions.
 Once
 the
 deﬁbrillator
 is
charged,
 pause
 the
 chest
 compressions,
 quickly
 ensure
 that
 all
rescuers
 are
 clear
 of
 the
 patient
 and
 then
 give
 one
 shock.
• Deﬁbrillation
 shock
 energy
 levels
 are
 unchanged
 from
 the
 2010
guidelines.194 For
 biphasic
 waveforms,
 use
 an
 initial
 shock
 energy
of
 at
 least
 150
 J.
 With
 manual
 deﬁbrillators
 it
 is
 appropriate
 to
consider
 escalating
 the
 shock
 energy
 if
 feasible,
 after
 a
 failed
shock
 and
 for
 patients
 where
 reﬁbrillation
 occurs.195,196
• Minimise
 the
 delay
 between
 stopping
 chest
 compressions
 and
delivery
 of
 the
 shock
 (the
 preshock
 pause);
 even
 a
 5–10
 s
 delay
will
 reduce
 the
 chances
 of
 the
 shock
 being
 successful.84,85,197,198
• Without
 pausing
 to
 reassess
 the
 rhythm
 or
 feel
 for
 a
 pulse,
 resume
CPR
 (CV
 ratio
 30:2)
 immediately
 after
 the
 shock,
 starting
 with
chest
 compressions
 to
 limit
 the
 post-shock
 pause
 and
 the
 total
peri-shock
 pause.84,85
• Continue
 CPR
 for
 2
 min,
 then
 pause
 brieﬂy
 to
 assess
 the
 rhythm;
if
 still
 VF/pVT,
 give
 a
 second
 shock
 (150–360
 J biphasic).
 Without
pausing
 to
 reassess
 the
 rhythm
 or
 feel
 for
 a
 pulse,
 resume
 CPR
(CV
 ratio
 30:2)
 immediately
 after
 the
 shock,
 starting
 with
 chest
compressions.
• Continue
 CPR
 for
 2
 min,
 then
 pause
 brieﬂy
 to
 assess
 the
 rhythm;
if
 still
 VF/pVT,
 give
 a
 third
 shock
 (150–360
 J
 biphasic).
 Without
reassessing
 the
 rhythm
 or
 feeling
 for
 a
 pulse,
 resume
 CPR
 (CV
ratio
 30:2)
 immediately
 after
 the
 shock,
 starting
 with
 chest
 com-
pressions.
• If
 IV/IO
 access
 has
 been
 obtained,
 during
 the
 next
 2
 min
 of
 CPR
give
 adrenaline
 1
 mg
 and
 amiodarone
 300
 mg.199
• The
 use
 of
 waveform
 capnography
 may
 enable
 ROSC
 to
 be
detected
 without
 pausing
 chest
 compressions
 and
 may
 be
 used
as
 a
 way
 of
 avoiding
 a
 bolus
 injection
 of
 adrenaline
 after
 ROSC
 has
been
 achieved.
 Several
 human
 studies
 have
 shown
 that
 there
 is
 a
signiﬁcant
 increase
 in
 EtCO2 when
 ROSC
 occurs.174,182–184,200,201
If
 ROSC
 is
 suspected
 during
 CPR
 withhold
 adrenaline.
 Give
adrenaline
 if
 cardiac
 arrest
 is
 conﬁrmed
 at
 the
 next
 rhythm
 check.
• If
 ROSC
 has
 not
 been
 achieved
 with
 this
 3rd
 shock,
 the
 adrenaline
may
 improve
 myocardial
 blood
 ﬂow
 and
 increase
 the
 chance
 of
successful
 deﬁbrillation
 with
 the
 next
 shock.
• Timing
 of
 adrenaline
 dosing
 can
 cause
 confusion
 amongst
ALS
 providers
 and
 this
 aspect
 needs
 to
 be
 emphasised
 during
training.202 Training
 should
 emphasise
 that
 giving
 drugs
 must
not
 lead
 to
 interruptions
 in
 CPR
 and
 delay
 interventions
 such
 as
deﬁbrillation.
 Human
 data
 suggests
 drugs
 can
 be
 given
 without
affecting
 the
 quality
 of
 CPR.186
• After
 each
 2-min
 cycle
 of
 CPR,
 if
 the
 rhythm
 changes
 to
 asystole
or
 PEA,
 see
 ‘non-shockable
 rhythms’
 below.
 If
 a
 non-shockable
rhythm
 is
 present
 and
 the
 rhythm
 is
 organised
 (complexes
 appear
regular
 or
 narrow),
 try
 to
 feel
 a
 pulse.
 Ensure
 that
 rhythm
 checks
are
 brief,
 and
 pulse
 checks
 are
 undertaken
 only
 if
 an
 organised
rhythm
 is
 observed.
 If
 there
 is
 any
 doubt
 about
 the
 presence
of
 a
 pulse
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 an
 organised
 rhythm,
 immediately
resume
 CPR.
 If
 ROSC
 has
 been
 achieved,
 begin
 post-resuscitation
care.
During
 treatment
 of
 VF/pVT,
 healthcare
 providers
 must
 practice
efﬁcient
 coordination
 between
 CPR
 and
 shock
 delivery
 whether
using
 a
 manual
 deﬁbrillator
 or
 an
 AED.
 Reduction
 in
 the
 peri-shock
pause
 (the
 interval
 between
 stopping
 compressions
 to
 resum-
ing
 compressions
 after
 shock
 delivery)
 by
 even
 a
 few
 seconds
can
 increase
 the
 probability
 of
 shock
 success.84,85,197,198 High-
quality
 CPR
 may
 improve
 the
 amplitude
 and
 frequency
 of
 the
 VF
and
 improve
 the
 chance
 of
 successful
 deﬁbrillation
 to
 a
 perfusing
rhythm.203–205
Regardless
 of
 the
 arrest
 rhythm,
 after
 the
 initial
 adrenaline
 dose
has
 been
 given,
 give
 further
 doses
 of
 adrenaline
 1
 mg  every
 3–5
 min
until
 ROSC
 is
 achieved;
 in
 practice,
 this
 will
 be
 about
 once
 every
 two
cycles
 of
 the
 algorithm.
 If
 signs
 of
 life
 return
 during
 CPR
 (purposeful
movement,
 normal
 breathing
 or
 coughing),
 or
 there
 is
 an
 increase
 in
EtCO2, check
 the
 monitor;
 if
 an
 organised
 rhythm
 is
 present,
 check
for
 a
 pulse.
 If
 a

 is
 palpable,
 start

 care.
 If

This
 three-shock
 strategy
 may
 also
 be
 considered
 for
 an
 initial,
witnessed
 VF/pVT
 cardiac
 arrest
 if
 the
 patient
 is
 already
 connected
to
 a
 manual
 deﬁbrillator.
 Although
 there
 are
 no
 data
 supporting
 a
three-shock
 strategy
 in
 any
 of
 these
 circumstances,
 it
 is
 unlikely
that
 chest
 compressions
 will
 improve
 the
 already
 very
 high
 chance
of
 ROSC
 when
 deﬁbrillation
 occurs
 early
 in
 the
 electrical
 phase,
immediately
 after
 onset
 of
 VF.
Airway
 and
 ventilation.
 During
 the
 treatment
 of
 persistent
 VF,
ensure
 good-quality
 chest
 compressions
 between
 deﬁbrillation
attempts.
 Consider
 reversible
 causes
 (4
 Hs
 and
 4
 Ts)
 and,
 if
 identi-
ﬁed,
 correct
 them.
 Tracheal
 intubation
 provides
 the
 most
 reliable
airway,
 but
 should
 be
 attempted
 only
 if
 the
 healthcare
 provider
 is
properly
 trained
 and
 has
 regular,
 ongoing
 experience
 with
 the
 tech-
nique.
 Tracheal
 intubation
 must
 not
 delay
 deﬁbrillation
 attempts.
Personnel
 skilled
 in
 advanced
 airway
 management
 should
 attempt
laryngoscopy
 and
 intubation
 without
 stopping
 chest
 compressions;
a
 brief
 pause
 in
 chest
 compressions
 may
 be
 required
 as
 the
 tube
is
 passed
 through
 the
 vocal
 cords,
 but
 this
 pause
 should
 be
 less
than
 5
 s.
 Alternatively,
 to
 avoid
 any
 interruptions
 in
 chest
 compres-
sions,
 the
 intubation
 attempt
 may
 be
 deferred
 until
 ROSC.
 No
 RCTs
have
 shown
 that
 tracheal
 intubation
 increases
 survival
 after
 cardiac
arrest.
 After
 intubation,
 conﬁrm
 correct
 tube
 position
 and
 secure
 it
adequately.
 Ventilate
 the
 lungs
 at
 10
 breaths
 min−1; do
 not
 hyper-
ventilate
 the
 patient.
 Once
 the
 patient’s
 trachea
 has
 been
 intubated,
continue
 chest
 compressions,
 at
 a
 rate
 of
 100–120
 min−1 without
pausing
 during
 ventilation.
In
 the
 absence
 of
 personnel
 skilled
 in
 tracheal
 intubation,
a
 supraglottic
 airway
 (SGA)
 (e.g.
 laryngeal
 mask
 airway,
 laryn-
geal
 tube
 or
 i-gel)
 is
 an
 acceptable
 alternative.
 Once
 a
 SGA
 has
been
 inserted,
 attempt
 to
 deliver
 continuous
 chest
 compressions,
uninterrupted
 by
 ventilation.206 If
 excessive
 gas
 leakage
 causes
inadequate
 ventilation
 of
 the
 patient’s
 lungs,
 chest
 compressions
will
 have
 to
 be
 interrupted
 to
 enable
 ventilation
 (using
 a
 CV
 ratio
of
 30:2).
Intravenous
 access
 and
 drugs.
 Establish
 intravenous
 access
 if
 this
has
 not
 already
 been
 achieved.
 Peripheral
 venous
 cannulation
 is
quicker,
 easier
 to
 perform
 and
 safer
 than
 central
 venous
 cannu-
lation.
 Drugs
 injected
 peripherally
 must
 be
 followed
 by
 a
 ﬂush
 of
at
 least
 20
 ml
 of
 ﬂuid
 and
 elevation
 of
 the
 extremity
 for
 10–20
 s
to
 facilitate
 drug
 delivery
 to
 the
 central
 circulation.
 If
 intravenous
access
 is
 difﬁcult
 or
 impossible,
 consider
 the
 IO
 route.
 This
 is
now
 established
 as
 an
 effective
 route
 in
 adults.207–210 Intraosseous
injection
 of
 drugs
 achieves
 adequate
 plasma
 concentrations
 in
 a
time
 comparable
 with
 injection
 through
 a
 vein.211,212
Non-shockable
 rhythms
 (PEA
 and
 asystole)
Pulseless
 electrical
 activity
 (PEA)
 is
 deﬁned
 as
 cardiac
 arrest
in
 the
 presence
 of
 electrical
 activity
 (other
 than
 ventricular
 tach-
yarrhythmia)
 that
 would
 normally
 be
 associated
 with
 a
 palpable
pulse.213 Survival
 following
 cardiac
 arrest
 with
 asystole
 or
 PEA
 is
unlikely
 unless
 a
 reversible
 cause
 can
 be
 found
 and
 treated
 effec-
tively.
If
 the
 initial
 monitored
 rhythm
 is
 PEA
 or
 asystole,
 start
 CPR
30:2.
 If
 asystole
 is
 displayed,
 without
 stopping
 CPR,
 check
 that
the
 leads
 are
 attached
 correctly.
 Once
 an
 advanced
 airway
 has
been
 sited,
 continue
 chest
 compressions
 without
 pausing
 during
ventilation.
 After
 2
 min
 of
 CPR,
 recheck
 the
 rhythm.
 If
 asystole
is
 present,
 resume
 CPR
 immediately.
 If
 an
 organised
 rhythm
 is
present,
 attempt
 to
 palpate
 a
 pulse.
 If
 no
 pulse
 is
 present
 (or
 if
 there
is
 any
 doubt
 about
 the
 presence
 of
 a
 pulse),
 continue
 CPR.
Give
 adrenaline
 1
 mg  as
 soon
 as
 venous
 or
 intraosseous
 access
is
 achieved,
 and
 repeat
 every
 alternate
 CPR
 cycle
 (i.e.
 about
 every
3–5
 min).
 If
 a
 pulse
 is
 present,
 begin
 post-resuscitation
 care.
 If
signs
 of
 life
 return
 during
 CPR,
 check
 the
 rhythm
 and
 check
 for
a
 pulse.
 If
 ROSC
 is
 suspected
 during
 CPR
 withhold
 adrenaline
 and
continue
 CPR.
 Give
 adrenaline
 if
 cardiac
 arrest
 is
 conﬁrmed
 at
 the
next
 rhythm
 check.
Whenever
 a
 diagnosis
 of
 asystole
 is
 made,
 check
 the
 ECG
 care-
fully
 for
 the
 presence
 of
 P
 waves,
 because
 this
 may
 respond
 to
cardiac
 pacing.
 There
 is
 no
 beneﬁt
 in
 attempting
 to
 pace
 true
 asys-
tole.
 In
 addition,
 if
 there
 is
 doubt
 about
 whether
 the
 rhythm
 is
asystole
 or
 extremely
 ﬁne
 VF,
 do
 not
 attempt
 deﬁbrillation;
 instead,
continue
 chest
 compressions
 and
 ventilation.
 Continuing
 high-
quality
 CPR
 however
 may
 improve
 the
 amplitude
 and
 frequency
of
 the
 VF
 and
 improve
 the
 chance
 of
 successful
 deﬁbrillation
 to
 a
perfusing
 rhythm.203–205
The
 optimal
 CPR
 time
 between
 rhythm
 checks
 may
 vary
 accord-
ing
 to
 the
 cardiac
 arrest
 rhythm
 and
 whether
 it
 is
 the
 ﬁrst
 or
subsequent
 loop.214 Based
 on
 expert
 consensus,
 for
 the
 treatment
of
 asystole
 or
 PEA,
 following
 a
 2-min
 cycle
 of
 CPR,
 if
 the
 rhythm
 has
changed
 to
 VF,
 follow
 the
 algorithm
 for
 shockable
 rhythms.
 Oth-
erwise,
 continue
 CPR
 and
 give
 adrenaline
 every
 3–5
 min
 following
the
 failure
 to
 detect
 a
 palpable
 pulse
 with
 the
 pulse
 check.
 If VF
is
 identiﬁed
 on
 the
 monitor
 midway
 through
 a
 2-min
 cycle
 of
 CPR,
complete
 the
 cycle
 of
 CPR
 before
 formal
 rhythm
 and
 shock
 delivery
if
 appropriate
 –
 this
 strategy
 will
 minimise
 interruptions
 in
 chest
compressions.
Potentially
 reversible
 causes
Potential
 causes
 or
 aggravating
 factors
 for
 which
 speciﬁc
 treat-
ment
 exists
 must
 be
 considered
 during
 any
 cardiac
 arrest.
 For
ease
 of
 memory,
 these
 are
 divided
 into
 two
 groups
 of
 four,
based
 upon
 their
 initial
 letter:
 either
 H
 or
 T.
 More
 details
 on
many
 of
 these
 conditions
 are
 covered
 in
 Section
 4
 (Special
Circumstances).3
Use
 of
 ultrasound
 imaging
 during
 advanced
 life
 support.
 Several
 stud-
ies
 have
 examined
 the
 use
 of
 ultrasound
 during
 cardiac
 arrest
to
 detect
 potentially
 reversible
 causes.215–217 Although
 no
 stud-
ies
 have
 shown
 that
 use
 of
 this
 imaging
 modality
 improves
outcome,
 there
 is
 no
 doubt
 that
 echocardiography
 has
 the
 poten-
tial
 to
 detect
 reversible
 causes
 of
 cardiac
 arrest.
 The
 integration
of
 ultrasound
 into
 advanced
 life
 support
 requires
 consider-
able
 training
 if
 interruptions
 to
 chest
 compressions
 are
 to
 be
minimised.
Monitoring
 during
 advanced
 life
 support
There
 are
 several
 methods
 and
 emerging
 technologies
 to
monitor
 the
 patient
 during
 CPR
 and
 potentially
 help
 guide
 ALS
interventions.
 These
 include:
• Clinical
 signs
 such
 as
 breathing
 efforts,
 movements
 and
 eye
 open-
ing
 can
 occur
 during
 CPR.
 These
 can
 indicate
 ROSC
 and
 require
veriﬁcation
 by
 a
 rhythm
 and
 pulse
 check,
 but
 can
 also
 occur
because
 CPR
 can
 generate
 a
 sufﬁcient
 circulation
 to
 restore
 signs
of
 life
 including
 consciousness.218
• The
 use
 of
 CPR
 feedback
 or
 prompt
 devices
 during
 CPR
 is
addressed
 in
 Section
 2
 Basic
 Life
 Support.1 The
 use
 of
 CPR
 feed-
back
 or
 prompt
 devices
 during
 CPR
 should
 only
 be
 considered
 as
part
 of
 a
 broader
 system
 of
 care
 that
 should
 include
 comprehen-
sive
 CPR
 quality
 improvement
 initiatives. 99,219

 value
 of
 attempting

 during

 assess
 the

 of

 necessarily
 indicate
 adequate
 myocardial
 or
 cerebral
perfusion.
• Monitoring
 the
 heart
 rhythm
 through
 pads,
 paddles
 or
 ECG
electrodes
 is
 a
 standard
 part
 of
 ALS.
 Motion
 artefacts
 prevent
reliable
 heart
 rhythm
 assessment
 during
 chest
 compressions
forcing
 rescuers
 to
 stop
 chest
 compressions
 to
 assess
 the
rhythm,
 and
 preventing
 early
 recognition
 of
 recurrent
 VF/pVT.
Some
 modern
 deﬁbrillators
 have
 ﬁlters
 that
 remove
 artefacts
from
 compressions
 but
 there
 are
 no
 human
 studies
 showing
improvements
 in
 patient
 outcomes
 from
 their
 use.
 We  suggest
against
 the
 routine
 use
 of
 artefact-ﬁltering
 algorithms
 for
 anal-
ysis
 of
 ECG
 rhythm
 during
 CPR
 unless
 as
 part
 of
 a
 research
programme.18
• The
 use
 of
 waveform
 capnography
 during
 CPR
 has
 a
 greater
emphasis
 in
 Guidelines
 2015
 and
 is
 addressed
 in
 more
 detail
below.
• Blood
 sampling
 and
 analysis
 during
 CPR
 can
 be
 used
 to
 iden-
tify
 potentially
 reversible
 causes
 of
 cardiac
 arrest.
 Avoid
 ﬁnger
prick
 samples
 in
 critical
 illness
 because
 they
 may
 not
 be
 reliable;
instead,
 use
 samples
 from
 veins
 or
 arteries.
• Blood
 gas
 values
 are
 difﬁcult
 to
 interpret
 during
 CPR.
 During
 car-
diac
 arrest,
 arterial
 gas
 values
 may
 be
 misleading
 and
 bear
 little
relationship
 to
 the
 tissue
 acid–base
 state.222 Analysis
 of
 central
venous
 blood
 may
 provide
 a
 better
 estimation
 of
 tissue
 pH.
 Cen-
tral
 venous
 oxygen
 saturation
 monitoring
 during
 ALS
 is
 feasible
but
 its
 role
 in
 guiding
 CPR
 is
 not
 clear.
• Invasive
 arterial
 pressure
 monitoring
 will
 enable
 the
 detection
of
 low
 blood
 pressure
 values
 when
 ROSC
 is
 achieved.
 Con-
sider
 aiming
 for
 an
 aortic
 diastolic
 pressure
 of
 greater
 than
25
 mmHg
 during
 CPR
 by
 optimising
 chest
 compressions.223
In
 practice
 this
 would
 mean
 measuring
 an
 arterial
 diastolic
pressure.
 Although
 haemodynamic-directed
 CPR
 showed
 some
beneﬁt
 in
 experimental
 studies 224–227 there
 is
 currently
 no
evidence
 of
 improvement
 in
 survival
 with
 this
 approach
 in
humans.175
• Ultrasound
 assessment
 is
 addressed
 above
 to
 identify
 and
 treat
reversible
 causes
 of
 cardiac
 arrest,
 and
 identify
 low
 cardiac
 output
states
 (‘pseudo-PEA’).
 Its
 use
 has
 been
 discussed
 above.
• Cerebral
 oximetry
 using
 near-infrared
 spectroscopy
 measures
regional
 cerebral
 oxygen
 saturation
 (rSO2)
 non-invasively.228–230
This
 remains
 an
 emerging
 technology
 that
 is
 feasible
 during
 CPR.
Its
 role
 in
 guiding
 CPR
 interventions
 including
 prognostication
during
 and
 after
 CPR
 is
 yet
 to
 be
 established.231
Waveform
 capnography
 during
 advanced
 life
 support.
 Waveform
capnography
 enables
 continuous
 real-time
 EtCO2 to
 be
 moni-
tored
 during
 CPR.
 During
 CPR,
 EtCO2 values
 are
 low,
 reﬂecting
the
 low
 cardiac
 output
 generated
 by
 chest
 compression.
 There
 is
currently
 no
 evidence
 that
 use
 of
 waveform
 capnography
 dur-
ing
 CPR
 improves
 patient
 outcomes,
 although
 the
 prevention
 of
unrecognised
 oesophageal
 intubation
 is
 clearly
 beneﬁcial.
 The
 role
of
 waveform
 capnography
 during
 CPR
 includes:
• Ensuring
 tracheal
 tube
 placement
 in
 the
 trachea
 (see
 below
 for
further
 details).
• Monitoring
 ventilation
 rate
 during
 CPR
 and
 avoiding
 hyperven-
tilation.
• Monitoring
 the
 quality
 of
 chest
 compressions
 during
 CPR.
 EtCO2
values
 are
 associated
 with
 compression
 depth
 and
 ventilation
rate
 and
 a
 greater
 depth
 of
 chest
 compression
 will
 increase
 the
value.232 Whether
 this
 can
 be
 used
 to
 guide
 care
 and
 improve
outcome
 requires
 further
 study.174
• Identifying
 ROSC
 during
 CPR.
 An
 increase
 in
 EtCO2 during
 CPR
may
 indicate
 ROSC
 and
 prevent
 unnecessary
 and
 potentially
harmful
 dosing
 of
 adrenaline
 in
 a
 patient
 with
 ROSC.174,182,200,201
If
 ROSC
 is
 suspected
 during
 CPR
 withhold
 adrenaline.
 Give
adrenaline
 if
 cardiac
 arrest
 is
 conﬁrmed
 at
 the
 next
 rhythm
 check.
• Prognostication
 during
 CPR.
 Lower
 EtCO2 values
 may
 indicate
 a
poor
 prognosis
 and
 less
 chance
 of
 ROSC;175 however,
 we
 recom-
mend
 that
 a
 speciﬁc
 EtCO2 value
 at
 any
 time
 during
 CPR
 should
not
 be
 used
 alone
 to
 stop
 CPR
 efforts.
 End-tidal
 CO2 values
 should
be
 considered
 only
 as
 part
 of
 a
 multi-modal
 approach
 to
 decision-
making
 for
 prognostication
 during
 CPR.
Extracorporeal
 Cardiopulmonary
 Resuscitation
 (eCPR)
Extracorporeal
 CPR
 (eCPR)
 should
 be
 considered
 as
 a
 rescue
therapy
 for
 those
 patients
 in
 whom
 initial
 ALS
 measures
 are
 unsuc-
cessful
 and,
 or
 to
 facilitate
 speciﬁc
 interventions
 (e.g.
 coronary
angiography
 and
 percutaneous
 coronary
 intervention
 (PCI)
 or
 pul-
monary
 thrombectomy
 for
 massive
 pulmonary
 embolism).233,234
There
 is
 an
 urgent
 need
 for
 randomised
 studies
 of
 eCPR
 and
 large
eCPR
 registries
 to
 identify
 the
 circumstances
 in
 which
 it
 works
 best,
establish
 guidelines
 for
 its
 use
 and
 identify
 the
 beneﬁts,
 costs
 and
risks
 of
 eCPR.235,236
Deﬁbrillation
The
 deﬁbrillation
 strategy
 for
 the
 ERC
 Guidelines
 2015
 has
changed
 little
 from
 the
 former
 guidelines:
• The
 importance
 of
 early,
 uninterrupted
 chest
 compressions
remains
 emphasised
 throughout
 these
 guidelines,
 together
 with
minimising
 the
 duration
 of
 pre-shock
 and
 post-shock
 pauses.
• Continue
 chest
 compressions
 during
 deﬁbrillator
 charging,
deliver
 deﬁbrillation
 with
 an
 interruption
 in
 chest
 compressions
of
 no
 more
 than
 5
 s
 and
 immediately
 resume
 chest
 compressions
following
 deﬁbrillation.
• Self-adhesive
 deﬁbrillation
 pads
 have
 a
 number
 of
 advantages
over
 manual
 paddles
 and
 should
 always
 be
 used
 in
 preference
when
 they
 are
 available.
• CPR
 should
 be
 continued
 while
 a
 deﬁbrillator
 or
 automated
 exter-
nal
 deﬁbrillator
 (AED)
 is
 retrieved
 and
 applied,
 but
 deﬁbrillation
should
 not
 be
 delayed
 longer
 than
 needed
 to
 establish
 the
 need
for
 deﬁbrillation
 and
 charging.
• The
 use
 of
 up
 to
 three-stacked
 shocks
 may
 be
 considered
if
 initial
 VF/pVT
 occurs
 during
 a
 witnessed,
 monitored
 arrest
with
 a
 deﬁbrillator
 immediately
 available,
 e.g.
 cardiac
 catheteri-
sation.
• Deﬁbrillation
 shock
 energy
 levels
 are
 unchanged
 from
 the
 2010
guidelines.194 For
 biphasic
 waveforms
 deliver
 the
 ﬁrst
 shock
with
 an
 energy
 of
 at
 least
 150
 J,
 the
 second
 and
 subsequent
shocks
 at
 150–360
 J.
 The
 shock
 energy
 for
 a
 particular
 deﬁ-
brillator
 should
 be
 based
 on
 the
 manufacturer’s
 guidance.
 It
is
 appropriate
 to
 consider
 escalating
 the
 shock
 energy
 if
 fea-
sible,
 after
 a
 failed
 shock
 and
 for
 patients
 where
 reﬁbrillation
occurs.195,196
Strategies
 for
 minimising
 the
 pre-shock
 pause
The
 delay
 between
 stopping
 chest
 compressions
 and
 delivery
 of
the
 shock
 (the
 pre-shock
 pause)
 must
 be
 kept
 to
 an
 absolute
 mini-
mum;
 even
 5–10
 s
 delay
 will
 reduce
 the
 chances
 of
 the
 shock
 being
successful.84,85,87,197,198,237 The
 pre-shock
 pause
 can
 be
 reduced
 to
less
 than
 5
 s
 by
 continuing
 compressions
 during
 charging
 of
 the
deﬁbrillator
 and
 by
 having
 an
 efﬁcient
 team
 coordinated
 by
 a
 leader
who
 communicates
 effectively.176,238 The
 safety
 check
 to
 avoid
 res-
cuer
 contact
 with
 the
 patient
 at
 the
 moment
 of
 deﬁbrillation
 should
be
 undertaken
 rapidly
 but
 efﬁciently.
 The
 post-shock
 pause
 is
 mini-
mised
 by
 resuming
 chest
 compressions
 immediately
 after
 shock
delivery
 (see
 below).

should
 be
 achievable
 with
 less
 than
 a
 5
 second
 interruption
 to
 chest
compressions.
Airway
 management
 and
 ventilation
The
 optimal
 strategy
 for
 managing
 the
 airway
 has
 yet
 to
 be
determined.
 Several
 observational
 studies
 have
 challenged
 the
premise
 that
 advanced
 airway
 interventions
 (tracheal
 intubation
or
 supraglottic
 airways)
 improve
 outcomes.239 The
 ILCOR
 ALS
Task
 Force
 has
 suggested
 using
 either
 an
 advanced
 airway
 (tra-
cheal
 intubation
 or
 supraglottic
 airway
 (SGA))
 or
 a
 bag-mask
 for
airway
 management
 during
 CPR.175 This
 very
 broad
 recommen-
dation
 is
 made
 because
 of
 the
 total
 absence
 of
 high
 quality
 data
to
 indicate
 which
 airway
 strategy
 is
 best.
 In
 practice
 a
 com-
bination
 of
 airway
 techniques
 will
 be
 used
 stepwise
 during
 a
resuscitation
 attempt.240 The
 best
 airway,
 or
 combination
 of
 air-
way
 techniques
 will
 vary
 according
 to
 patient
 factors,
 the
 phase
 of
the
 resuscitation
 attempt
 (during
 CPR,
 after
 ROSC),
 and
 the
 skills
 of
rescuers.192
Conﬁrmation
 of
 correct
 placement
 of
 the
 tracheal
 tube
Unrecognised
 oesophageal
 intubation
 is
 the
 most
 serious
 com-
plication
 of
 attempted
 tracheal
 intubation.
 Routine
 use
 of
 primary
and
 secondary
 techniques
 to
 conﬁrm
 correct
 placement
 of
 the
tracheal
 tube
 should
 reduce
 this
 risk.
 The
 ILCOR
 ALS
 Task
 Force
recommends
 using
 waveform
 capnography
 to
 conﬁrm
 and
 con-
tinuously
 monitor
 the
 position
 of
 a
 tracheal
 tube
 during
 CPR
in
 addition
 to
 clinical
 assessment
 (strong
 recommendation,
 low
quality
 evidence).
 Waveform
 capnography
 is
 given
 a
 strong
 rec-
ommendation
 as
 it
 may
 have
 other
 potential
 uses
 during
 CPR
 (e.g.
monitoring
 ventilation
 rate,
 assessing
 quality
 of
 CPR).
 The
 ILCOR
ALS
 Task
 Force
 recommends
 that
 if
 waveform
 capnography
 is
 not
available,
 a
 non-waveform
 carbon
 dioxide
 detector,
 oesophageal
detector
 device
 or
 ultrasound
 in
 addition
 to
 clinical
 assessment
 is
an
 alternative.
Drugs
 and
 ﬂuids
 for
 cardiac
 arrest
Vasopressors
Despite
 the
 continued
 widespread
 use
 of
 adrenaline
 and
 the
 use
of
 vasopressin
 during
 resuscitation
 in
 some
 countries,
 there
 is
 no
placebo-controlled
 study
 that
 shows
 that
 the
 routine
 use
 of
 any
vasopressor
 during
 human
 cardiac
 arrest
 increases
 survival
 to
 hos-
pital
 discharge,
 although
 improved
 short-term
 survival
 has
 been
documented.186,187,189
Our
 current
 recommendation
 is
 to
 continue
 the
 use
 of
adrenaline
 during
 CPR
 as
 for
 Guidelines
 2010.
 We  have
 consid-
ered
 the
 beneﬁt
 in
 short-term
 outcomes
 (ROSC
 and
 admission
 to
hospital)
 and
 our
 uncertainty
 about
 the
 beneﬁt
 or
 harm
 on
 sur-
vival
 to
 discharge
 and
 neurological
 outcome
 given
 the
 limitations
 of
the
 observational
 studies.175,241,242 We  have
 decided
 not
 to
 change
current
 practice
 until
 there
 is
 high-quality
 data
 on
 long-term
 out-
comes.
A
 series
 of
 randomised
 controlled
 trials243–247 demonstrated
 no
difference
 in
 outcomes
 (ROSC,
 survival
 to
 discharge,
 or
 neurological
outcome)
 with
 vasopressin
 versus
 adrenaline
 as
 a
 ﬁrst
 line
 vaso-
pressor
 in
 cardiac
 arrest.
 Other
 studies
 comparing
 adrenaline
 alone
or
 in
 combination
 with
 vasopressin
 also
 demonstrated
 no
 differ-
ence
 in
 ROSC,
 survival
 to
 discharge
 or
 neurological
 outcome.248–250
We  suggest
 vasopressin
 should
 not
 be
 used
 in
 cardiac
 arrest
 instead
of
 adrenaline.
 Those
 healthcare
 professionals
 working
 in
 systems
that
 already
 use
 vasopressin
 may
 continue
 to
 do
 so
 because
 there
is
 no
 evidence
 of
 harm
 from
 using
 vasopressin
 when
 compared
 to
adrenaline.175
Anti-arrhythmics
As
 with
 vasopressors,
 the
 evidence
 that
 anti-arrhythmic
 drugs
are
 of
 beneﬁt
 in
 cardiac
 arrest
 is
 limited.
 No
 anti-arrhythmic
 drug
given
 during
 human
 cardiac
 arrest
 has
 been
 shown
 to
 increase
 sur-
vival
 to
 hospital
 discharge,
 although
 amiodarone
 has
 been
 shown
to
 increase
 survival
 to
 hospital
 admission.251,252 Despite
 the
 lack
of
 human
 long-term
 outcome
 data,
 the
 balance
 of
 evidence
 is
 in
favour
 of
 the
 use
 anti-arrhythmic
 drugs
 for
 the
 management
 of
arrhythmias
 in
 cardiac
 arrest.
 Following
 three
 initial
 shocks,
 amio-
darone
 in
 shock-refractory
 VF
 improves
 the
 short-term
 outcome
of
 survival
 to
 hospital
 admission
 compared
 with
 placebo251 or
lidocaine.252 Amiodarone
 also
 appears
 to
 improve
 the
 response
 to
deﬁbrillation
 when
 given
 to
 humans
 or
 animals
 with
 VF
 or
 haemo-
dynamically
 unstable
 ventricular
 tachycardia.253–257 There
 is
 no
evidence
 to
 indicate
 the
 optimal
 time
 at
 which
 amiodarone
 should
be
 given
 when
 using
 a
 single-shock
 strategy.
 In
 the
 clinical
 studies
to
 date,
 the
 amiodarone
 was
 given
 if
 VF/pVT
 persisted
 after
 at
 least
three
 shocks.
 For
 this
 reason,
 and
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 any
 other
 data,
amiodarone
 300
 mg  is
 recommended
 if
 VF/pVT
 persists
 after
 three
shocks.
Lidocaine
 is
 recommended
 for
 use
 during
 ALS
 when
 amiodarone
is
 unavailable.252 Do
 not
 use
 magnesium
 routinely
 for
 the
 treat-
ment
 of
 cardiac
 arrest.
Other
 drug
 therapy
Do
 not
 give
 sodium
 bicarbonate
 routinely
 during
 cardiac
 arrest
and
 CPR
 or
 after
 ROSC.
 Consider
 sodium
 bicarbonate
 for
 life-
threatening
 hyperkalaemia,
 for
 cardiac
 arrest
 associated
 with
hyperkalaemia
 and
 for
 tricyclic
 overdose.
Fibrinolytic
 therapy
 should
 not
 be
 used
 routinely
 in
 cardiac
arrest.
 Consider
 ﬁbrinolytic
 therapy
 when
 cardiac
 arrest
 is
 caused
by
 proven
 or
 suspected
 acute
 pulmonary
 embolism.
 Following
 ﬁbri-
nolysis
 during
 CPR
 for
 acute
 pulmonary
 embolism,
 survival
 and
good
 neurological
 outcome
 have
 been
 reported
 in
 cases
 requiring
in
 excess
 of
 60
 min
 of
 CPR.
 If
 a
 ﬁbrinolytic
 drug
 is
 given
 in
 these
 cir-
cumstances,
 consider
 performing
 CPR
 for
 at
 least
 60–90
 min
 before
termination
 of
 resuscitation
 attempts.258–260 Ongoing
 CPR
 is
 not
 a
contraindication
 to
 ﬁbrinolysis.
Intravenous
 ﬂuids
Hypovolaemia
 is
 a
 potentially
 reversible
 cause
 of
 cardiac
 arrest.
Infuse
 ﬂuids
 rapidly
 if
 hypovolaemia
 is
 suspected.
 In
 the
 initial
stages
 of
 resuscitation
 there
 are
 no
 clear
 advantages
 to
 using
 col-
loid,
 so
 use
 balanced
 crystalloid
 solutions
 such
 as
 Hartmann’s
solution
 or
 0.9%
 sodium
 chloride.
 Avoid
 dextrose,
 which
 is
 redis-
tributed
 away
 from
 the
 intravascular
 space
 rapidly
 and
 causes
hyperglycaemia,
 and
 may
 worsen
 neurological
 outcome
 after
 car-
diac
 arrest.261
CPR
 techniques
 and
 devices
Although
 manual
 chest
 compressions
 are
 often
 performed
 very
poorly,262–264 no
 adjunct
 has
 consistently
 been
 shown
 to
 be
 supe-
rior
 to
 conventional
 manual
 CPR.
Mechanical
 chest
 compression
 devices
Since
 Guidelines
 2010
 there
 have
 been
 three
 large
 RCTs
enrolling
 7582
 patients
 that
 have
 shown
 no
 clear
 advantage
from
 the
 routine
 use
 of
 automated
 mechanical
 chest
 compression
devices
 for
 OHCA.36,265,266 We  suggest
 that
 automated
 mechanical
chest
 compression
 devices
 are
 not
 used
 routinely
 to
 replace
 manual
chest
 compressions.
 We  suggest
 that
 automated
 mechanical
 chest
compression
 devices
 are
 a
 reasonable
 alternative
 to
 high-quality
manual
 chest
 compressions
 in
 situations
 where
 sustained
 high-
quality
 manual
 chest
 compressions
 are
 impractical
 or
 compromise
provider
 safety,
 such
 as
 CPR
 in
 a
 moving
 ambulance,

Interruptions
 to
 CPR
 during

 should
 be
 avoided.
Healthcare
 personnel
 who
 use
 mechanical

 should
 do
 so
 only
within
 a
 structured,
 monitored
 programme,
 which
 should
 include
comprehensive
 competency-based

 and
 regular
 opportu-

Impedance
 threshold
 device
 (ITD)
An
 RCT
 of
 the
 ITD
 with
 standard
 CPR
 compared
 to
 standard
 CPR
alone
 with
 8718
 OHCA
 patients
 failed
 to
 show
 any
 beneﬁt
 with
 ITD

 in
 terms
 of
 survival
 and
 neurological
 outcome.267 We  there-
fore
 recommend
 that
 the
 ITD
 is
 not
 used
 routinely
 with
 standard
CPR.
 Two
 RCTs
 did
 not
 show
 a
 beneﬁt
 in
 terms
 of

 to

 of

sion

 of
 a
 large
 trial
 of
 a

 of
 ITD
with
 active

 (ACD

 compared

 were
 reported
 in

was
 no

 12
 months,
 and
 after
 consideration
 of
 the
number

 a

 was

 not
 to

Peri-arrest
 arrhythmias
The
 correct
 identiﬁcation
 and
 treatment
 of
 arrhythmias
 in
 the
critically
 ill
 patient
 may
 prevent
 cardiac
 arrest
 from
 occurring
 or
reoccurring
 after
 successful
 initial
 resuscitation.
 The
 initial
 assess-
ment
 and
 treatment
 of
 a
 patient
 with
 an
 arrhythmia
 should
 follow
the
 ABCDE
 approach.
 The
 assessment
 and
 treatment
 of
 all
 arrhyth-
mias
 addresses
 two
 factors:
 the
 condition
 of
 the
 patient
 (stable
versus
 unstable),
 and
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 arrhythmia.
 Anti-arrhythmic
drugs
 are
 slower
 in
 onset
 and
 less
 reliable
 than
 electrical
 cardiover-
sion
 in
 converting
 a
 tachycardia
 to
 sinus
 rhythm;
 thus,
 drugs
 tend
to
 be
 reserved
 for
 stable
 patients
 without
 adverse
 signs,
 and
 electri-
cal
 cardioversion
 is
 usually
 the
 preferred
 treatment
 for
 the
 unstable
patient
 displaying
 adverse
 signs.
 Algorithms
 for
 the
 treatment
 of
tachycardia
 and
 bradycardia
 are
 unchanged
 from
 2010
 and
 are
show
 in
 Figs.
 1.8
 and
 1.9.
The
 presence
 or
 absence
 of
 adverse
 signs
 or
 symptoms
 will
 dic-
tate
 the
 appropriate
 treatment
 for
 most
 arrhythmias.
 The
 following
adverse
 factors
 indicate
 a
 patient
 who
 is
 unstable
 because
 of
 the
arrhythmia.
1.
 Shock
 –
 this
 is
 seen
 as
 pallor,
 sweating,
 cold
 and
 clammy
 extrem-
ities
 (increased
 sympathetic
 activity),
 impaired
 consciousness
(reduced
 cerebral
 blood
 ﬂow),
 and
 hypotension
 (e.g.
 systolic
blood
 pressure
 <90
 mmHg).
2.
 Syncope
 –
 loss
 of
 consciousness,
 which
 occurs
 as
 a
 consequence
of
 reduced
 cerebral
 blood
 ﬂow
3.
 Heart
 failure
 –
 arrhythmias
 compromise
 myocardial
 perfor-
mance
 by
 reducing
 coronary
 artery
 blood
 ﬂow.
 In
 acute
situations
 this
 is
 manifested
 by
 pulmonary
 oedema
 (failure
 of
 the
left
 ventricle)
 and/or
 raised
 jugular
 venous
 pressure,
 and
 hepatic
engorgement
 (failure
 of
 the
 right
 ventricle).
4.
 Myocardial
 ischaemia
 –
 this
 occurs
 when
 myocardial
 oxy-
gen
 consumption
 exceeds
 delivery.
 Myocardial
 ischaemia
 may
present
 with
 chest
 pain
 (angina)
 or
 may
 occur
 without
 pain
as
 an
 isolated
 ﬁnding
 on
 the
 12
 lead
 ECG
 (silent
 ischaemia).
The
 presence
 of
 myocardial
 ischaemia
 is
 especially
 important
if
 there
 is
 underlying
 coronary
 artery
 disease
 or
 structural
 heart
disease
 because
 it
 may
 cause
 further
 life-threatening
 complica-
tions
 including
 cardiac
 arrest.
Having
 determined
 the
 rhythm
 and
 the
 presence
 or
 absence
 of
adverse
 signs,
 the
 options
 for
 immediate
 treatment
 are
 categorised
as:
• Electrical
 (cardioversion,
 pacing).
• Pharmacological
 (anti-arrhythmic
 (and
 other)
 drugs).
Cardiac
 arrest
 in
 special
 circumstances
Special
 causes
Hypoxia
Cardiac
 arrest
 caused
 by
 hypoxaemia
 is
 usually
 a
 consequence
of
 asphyxia,
 which
 accounts
 for
 most
 of
 the
 non-cardiac
 causes
 of
cardiac
 arrest.
 Survival
 after
 cardiac
 arrest
 from
 asphyxia
 is
 rare
 and
most
 survivors
 sustain
 severe
 neurological
 injury.
 Those
 who
 are
unconscious
 but
 have
 not
 progressed
 to
 a
 cardiac
 arrest
 are
 much
more
 likely
 to
 make
 a
 good
 neurological
 recovery.272,273
Hypo-/hyperkalaemia
 and
 other
 electrolyte
 disorders
Electrolyte
 abnormalities
 can
 cause
 cardiac
 arrhythmias
 or
cardiac
 arrest.
 Life-threatening
 arrhythmias
 are
 associated
 most
commonly
 with
 potassium
 disorders,
 particularly
 hyperkalaemia.
Hypothermia
 (accidental)
Accidental
 hypothermia
 is
 deﬁned
 as
 an
 involuntary
 drop
 of
the
 body
 core
 temperature
 <35 ◦C.
 Cooling
 of
 the
 human
 body
decreases
 cellular
 oxygen
 consumption
 by
 about
 6%
 per
 1 ◦C
decrease
 in
 core
 temperature.274 At
 18 ◦C
 the
 brain
 can
 toler-
ate
 cardiac
 arrest
 for
 up
 to
 10
 times
 longer
 than
 at
 37 ◦C.
 This
results
 in
 hypothermia
 exerting
 a
 protective
 effect
 on
 the
 brain
and
 heart,275 and
 intact
 neurological
 recovery
 may
 be
 possible
 even
after
 prolonged
 cardiac
 arrest
 if
 deep
 hypothermia
 develops
 before
asphyxia.
 If
 an
 ECLS
 centre
 is
 not
 available,
 rewarming
 may
 be
attempted
 in
 hospital
 using
 a
 combination
 of
 external
 and
 inter-
nal
 rewarming
 techniques
 (e.g.
 forced
 warm
 air,
 warm
 infusions,
forced
 peritoneal
 lavage).276
Hyperthermia
Hyperthermia
 occurs
 when
 the
 body’s
 ability
 to
 thermoregulate
fails
 and
 core
 temperature
 exceeds
 that
 normally
 maintained
 by
homeostatic
 mechanisms.
Hyperthermia
 is
 a
 continuum
 of
 heat-related
 conditions,
 start-
ing
 with
 heat
 stress,
 progressing
 to
 heat
 exhaustion,
 heat
 stroke
and
 ﬁnally
 multiple
 organ
 dysfunction
 and
 cardiac
 arrest.277 The
mainstay
 of
 treatment
 is
 supportive
 therapy
 and
 rapidly
 cool-
ing
 the
 patient.278–280 Start
 cooling
 in
 the
 prehospital
 setting
 if
possible.
 Aim
 to
 rapidly
 reduce
 the
 core
 temperature
 to
 approx-
imately
 39 ◦C.
 If
 cardiac
 arrest
 occurs,
 follow
 standard
 guidelines
and
 continue
 cooling
 the
 patient.
 Use
 the
 same
 cooling
 tech-
niques
 as
 for
 targeted
 temperature
 management
 after
 cardiac
arrest
Hypovolaemia
Hypovolaemia
 is
 a
 potentially
 treatable
 cause
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
that
 usually
 results
 from
 a
 reduced
 intravascular
 volume
 (i.e.
 hae-
morrhage),
 but
 relative
 hypovolaemia
 may
 also
 occur
 in
 patients
with
 severe
 vasodilation
 (e.g.
 anaphylaxis,
 sepsis).
Depending
 on
 the
 suspected
 cause,
 initiate
 volume
 therapy
 with
warmed
 blood
 products
 and/or
 crystalloids,
 in
 order
 to
 rapidly
restore
 intravascular
 volume.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 initiate
 immedi-
ate
 intervention
 to
 control
 haemorrhage,
 e.g.
 surgery,
 endoscopy,
endovascular
 techniques,281 or
 treat
 the
 primary
 cause
 (e.g.
 ana-
phylactic
 shock).

Anaphylaxis.
 Anaphylaxis
 is
 a
 severe,
 life-threatening,
 generalised
or
 systemic
 hypersensitivity
 reaction.
 This
 is
 characterised
 by
rapidly
 developing
 life-threatening
 airway
 and/or
 breathing
 and/or
circulation
 problems
 usually
 associated
 with
 skin
 and
 mucosal
changes.282–285 Adrenaline
 is
 the
 most
 important
 drug
 for
 the
treatment
 of
 anaphylaxis.286,287 The
 treatment
 algorithm
 for
 ana-
phylaxis,
 including
 the
 correct
 doses
 for
 adrenaline,
 is
 shown
in
 Fig.
 1.10. Adrenaline
 is
 most
 effective
 when
 given
 early
 after
the
 onset
 of
 the
 reaction,288 and
 adverse
 effects
 are
 extremely
rare
 with
 correct
 IM
 doses.
 Repeat
 the
 IM
 adrenaline
 dose
 if
there
 is
 no
 improvement
 in
 the
 patient’s
 condition
 within
 5
 min.
IV
 adrenaline
 should
 only
 be
 used
 by
 those
 experienced
 in
the
 use
 and
 titration
 of
 vasopressors
 in
 their
 normal
 clinical
practice.
Traumatic
 cardiac
 arrest.
 Traumatic
 cardiac
 arrest
 (TCA)
 carries
 a
very
 high
 mortality,
 but
 in
 those
 where
 ROSC
 can
 be
 achieved,
neurological
 outcome
 in
 survivors
 appears
 to
 be
 much
 better
than
 in
 other
 causes
 of
 cardiac
 arrest.289,290 It
 is
 vital
 that
 a
medical
 cardiac
 arrest
 is
 not
 misdiagnosed
 as
 a
 TCA
 as
 it
 must
be
 treated
 with
 the
 universal
 ALS
 algorithm.
 In
 cardiac
 arrest
caused
 by
 hypovolaemia,
 cardiac
 tamponade
 or
 tension
 pneu-
mothorax,
 chest
 compressions
 are
 unlikely
 to
 be
 as
 effective
 as
 in
normovolaemic
 cardiac
 arrest.291,292 For
 this
 reason,
 chest
 com-
pressions
 take
 a
 lower
 priority
 than
 the
 immediate
 treatment
of
 reversible
 causes,
 e.g.
 thoracotomy,
 controlling
 haemorrhage
etc.

 chest

 is
 rapid
and
 within
 the
 skill
 set
 of
 most
 ambulance
 personnel

 is
 of

 value.296,297 Simple
 thoracostomy
 is
 easy
 to
 perform
 and
used
 routinely
 by
 several
 prehospital
 physician
 services.298,299 This
consists
 of

 of
 standard

 –
 a
 simple

 and
 rapid

 into
 the

 in
 the

Tamponade
 (cardiac)
The
 mortality
 after
 cardiac
 tamponade
 is
 high
 and
 immediate
decompression
 of
 the
 pericardium
 is
 required
 to
 give
 any
 chance
 of
survival.
 If
 thoracotomy
 is
 not
 possible,
 consider
 ultrasound-guided
pericardiocentesis
 to
 treat
 cardiac
 arrest
 associated
 with
 suspected
traumatic
 or
 non-traumatic
 cardiac
 tamponade.
 Non-image
 guided
pericardiocentesis
 is
 an
 alternative,
 only
 if
 ultrasound
 is
 not
 avail-
able.
Thrombosis
Pulmonary
 
embolism.
 Cardiac
 
arrest
 
from
 
acute
 
pulmonary
embolism
 is
 the
 most
 serious
 clinical
 presentation
 of
 venous
thromboembolism.300 The
 reported
 incidence
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
caused
 by
 pulmonary
 embolism
 is
 2–9%
 of
 all
 OHCAs,183,301–303
and
 5–6%
 of
 all
 in-hospital
 cardiac
 arrests.304,305 Diagnosis
 of
 acute
pulmonary
 embolism
 during
 cardiac
 arrest
 is
 difﬁcult.
 Clinical
history
 
and
 
assessment,
 
capnography
 
and
 
echocardiography
(if
 available)
 can
 all
 assist
 in
 the
 diagnosis
 of
 acute
 pulmonary
embolism
 during
 CPR
 with
 varying
 degrees
 of
 speciﬁcity
 and
sensitivity.
 Consider
 administration
 of
 ﬁbrinolytic
 therapy
 when
acute
 pulmonary
 embolism
 is
 a
 known
 or
 suspected
 cause
 of
 car-
diac
 arrest.
 Ongoing
 CPR
 is
 not
 a
 contraindication
 to
 ﬁbrinolysis.
The
 potential
 beneﬁt
 of
 ﬁbrinolysis
 in
 terms
 of
 improved
 survival
outweighs
 potential
 risks
 in
 a
 location
 where
 no
 alternative
 exists,
e.g.
 in
 the
 prehospital
 setting.258 Once
 a
 ﬁbrinolytic
 drug
 is
 admin-
istered,
 continue
 CPR
 for
 at
 least
 60–90
 min
 before
 terminating
resuscitation
 attempts.258,259
Coronary
 thrombosis.
 Although
 proper
 diagnosis
 of
 the
 cause
 of
 car-
diac
 arrest
 may
 be
 difﬁcult
 in
 a
 patient
 already
 in
 cardiac
 arrest,
if
 the
 initial
 rhythm
 is
 VF
 it
 is
 most
 likely
 that
 the
 cause
 is
 coro-
nary
 artery
 disease
 with
 an
 occluded
 large
 coronary
 vessel.
 In
these
 cases,
 transport
 with
 ongoing
 CPR
 and
 immediate
 access
 to
the
 catheterisation
 laboratory
 may
 be
 considered
 if
 a
 prehospital
and
 in-hospital
 infrastructure
 is
 available
 with
 teams
 experienced
in
 mechanical
 haemodynamic
 support
 and
 primary
 percutaneous
coronary
 intervention
 (PPCI)
 with
 ongoing
 CPR.
 A
 decision
 to
 trans-
port
 with
 ongoing
 CPR
 should
 take
 into
 consideration
 a
 realistic
chance
 of
 survival
 (e.g.
 witnessed
 cardiac
 arrest
 with
 initial
 shock-
able
 rhythm
 (VF/pVT)
 and
 bystander
 CPR).
 Intermittent
 ROSC
 also
strongly
 favours
 a
 decision
 to
 transport.306
Toxins
Overall,
 poisoning
 rarely
 causes
 cardiac
 arrest
 or
 death.307 There
are
 few
 speciﬁc
 therapeutic
 measures
 for
 poisoning
 that
 improve
outcomes:
 decontamination,
 enhancing
 elimination,
 and
 the
 use
of
 speciﬁc
 antidotes.308–310 The
 preferred
 method
 of
 gastrointesti-
nal
 decontamination
 in
 patients
 with
 an
 intact
 or
 protected
 airway
is
 activated
 charcoal.
 It
 is
 most
 effective
 if
 given
 within
 1
 h
 of
ingestion.311
Special
 environments
Perioperative
 cardiac
 arrest
The
 commonest
 cause
 of
 anaesthesia-related
 cardiac
 arrest
involves
 airway
 management.312,313 Cardiac
 arrest
 caused
 by
bleeding
 had
 the
 highest
 mortality
 in
 non-cardiac
 surgery,
 with
only
 10.3%
 of
 these
 patients
 surviving
 to
 hospital
 discharge.314
Patients
 in
 the
 operating
 room
 are
 normally
 fully
 monitored
 and,
 as
such,
 there
 should
 be
 little
 or
 no
 delay
 in
 diagnosing
 cardiac
 arrest.
Cardiac
 arrest
 following
 cardiac
 surgery
Cardiac
 arrest
 following
 major
 cardiac
 surgery
 is
 relatively
common
 in
 the
 immediate
 post-operative
 phase,
 with
 a
 reported
incidence
 of
 0.7–8%.315,316 Emergency
 resternotomy
 is
 an
 integral
part
 of
 resuscitation
 after
 cardiac
 surgery,
 once
 all
 other
 reversible
causes
 have
 been
 excluded.
 Once
 adequate
 airway
 and
 ventilation
has
 been
 established,
 and
 if
 three
 attempts
 at
 deﬁbrillation
 have
failed
 in
 VF/pVT,
 undertake
 resternotomy
 without

gency

Cardiac
 arrest
 in
 a
 cardiac
 catheterisation
 laboratory
Cardiac
 arrest
 (commonly
 VF)
 may
 occur
 during
 percutaneous
coronary
 intervention
 (PCI)
 for
 ST-elevation
 myocardial
 infarction
(STEMI)
 or
 non-STEMI,
 but
 it
 may
 also
 be
 a
 complication
 of
 angiog-
raphy.
 In
 this
 special
 setting
 with
 immediate
 response
 to
 monitored
VF,
 deﬁbrillation
 without
 preceding
 chest
 compressions
 is
 recom-
mended.
 If
 needed
 for
 failed
 deﬁbrillation
 or
 immediately
 recurring
VF,
 immediate
 deﬁbrillation
 may
 be
 repeated
 up
 to
 two
 times.
 If
VF
 persists
 after
 the
 initial
 three
 shocks
 or
 ROSC
 not
 immediately
established
 with
 certainty,
 chest
 compressions
 and
 ventilations
must
 be
 initiated
 without
 further
 delay
 and
 a
 cause
 for
 the
 unre-
solved
 problem
 sought
 with
 further
 coronary
 angiography.
 On
 an
angiography
 table
 with
 the
 image

 above
 the
 patient,
delivering
 chest
 compressions
 with
 adequate
 depth
 and

 is
almost
 impossible
 and
 exposes
 the
 rescuers
 to
 dangerous
 radia-
tion.
 Therefore,
 early
 transition
 to
 the
 use
 of
 a
 mechanical
 chest
compression
 device
 is
 strongly
 recommended.317,318 If
 the

lem
 is

Cardiac
 arrest
 in
 a
 dialysis
 unit
Sudden
 cardiac
 death
 is
 the
 most
 common
 cause
 of
 death
in
 haemodialysis
 patients
 and
 is
 usually
 preceded
 by
 ventricu-
lar
 arrhythmias.320 Hyperkalaemia
 contributes
 to
 2–5%
 of
 deaths
amongst
 haemodialysis
 patients 321 A
 shockable
 rhythm
 (VF/pVT)
is
 more
 common
 in
 patients
 undergoing
 haemodialysis. 320,322,323
Most
 haemodialysis
 machine
 manufacturers
 recommend
 discon-
nection
 from
 the
 dialysis
 equipment
 prior
 to
 deﬁbrillation.324
Cardiac

 Cardiac

 has
an
 incidence
 of
 1
 per
 5–10
 million
 passenger
 ﬂights.
 An
 initial
shockable
 rhythm
 is
 present
 in
 25–31%
 patients,325–328 and
 the
in-ﬂight
 use
 of
 an
 AED
 can
 result
 in
 33–50%
 survival
 to
 hospital

Cardiac

 Air

 services
operate
 either
 a
 helicopter
 emergency
 medical
 service
 (HEMS)
 or
ﬁxed-wing
 air
 ambulances
 that
 routinely
 transport
 critically
 ill
patients.
 Cardiac
 arrest
 may
 occur
 in
 ﬂight,
 both
 in
 patients
 being
transported
 from
 an
 accident
 site
 and
 also
 critically
 ill
 patients
being
 transported
 between
 hospital.330,331
If
 a
 shockable
 rhythm
 (VF/pVT)
 is
 recognised
 in
 a
 monitored
patient
 and
 deﬁbrillation
 can
 be
 accomplished
 rapidly,
 imme-
diately
 give
 up
 to
 three-stacked
 shocks
 before
 starting
 chest
compressions.
 Mechanical
 chest
 compression
 devices
 enable
 deliv-
ery
 of
 high
 quality
 chest
 compressions
 in
 the
 conﬁned
 space
 of
 an
air
 ambulance
 and
 their
 use
 should
 be
 considered.332,333 If
 a
 cardiac

 during
 ﬂight
 is
 thought
 to
 be
 a
 possibility,
 consider
 ﬁtting
the
 patient
 within
 a
 mechanical

 sudden

 unexpected
 collapse,
 not
 associated
 with
 con-

 or
 trauma,
 of
 an

 on
 the
 ﬁeld
 of

 is
 probably
 cardiac
in
 origin
 and
 requires
 rapid
 recognition
 and
 effective
 treatment
 if
the

 is
 to
 survive.
 If
 there
 is
 no
 immediate
 response
 to

ment
 and
 there
 is
 an
 organised
 medical
 team,
 consider
 moving
the
 patient
 to
 an

 If
 the

 is
 in

 delay
 moving

cardiovascular
 and
 metabolic
 risk
 factors
 for
 cardiac
 arrest.
 Resus-
citation
 at
 high
 altitude
 does
 not
 differ
 from
 standard
 CPR.
 With
the
 lower
 pO2, CPR
 is
 more
 exhausting
 for
 the
 rescuer
 than
 at
sea
 level,
 and
 the
 average
 number
 of
 effective
 chest
 compres-
sions
 may
 decrease
 within
 the
 ﬁrst
 minute.349–351 Use
 mechanical
chest
 compression
 devices
 whenever
 possible.
 In
 situations
 where
transport
 is
 not
 possible,
 and
 correction
 of
 reversible
 causes
 is
not
 possible,
 further
 resuscitation
 is
 futile
 and
 CPR
 should
 be
terminated.
Avalanche
 burial.
 In
 Europe
 and
 North
 America
 together,
 there
are
 about
 150
 snow
 avalanche
 deaths
 each
 year.
 Fatalities
 are
mainly
 due
 to
 asphyxia,
 sometimes
 associated
 with
 trauma
 and
hypothermia.
 Prognostic
 factors
 are
 severity
 of
 injury,
 duration
of
 complete
 burial,
 airway
 patency,
 core
 temperature
 and
 serum
potassium.352 The
 cut-off
 criteria
 for
 prolonged
 CPR
 and
 extra-
corporeal
 rewarming
 of
 avalanche
 victims
 in
 cardiac
 arrest
 have
become
 more
 stringent
 to
 reduce
 the
 number
 of
 futile
 cases
treated
 with
 extracorporeal
 life
 support
 (ECLS).
 An

 of

Lightning
 strike
 and
 electrical
 injuries.
 Electrical
 injury
 is
 a
 rela-
tively
 infrequent
 but
 potentially
 devastating
 multisystem
 injury
with
 high
 morbidity
 and
 mortality,
 causing
 0.54
 deaths
 per
 100,000
people
 each
 year.
 Ensure
 that
 any
 power
 source
 is
 switched
off
 and
 do
 not
 approach
 the
 casualty
 until
 it
 is
 safe.
 Electrocu-
tion
 from
 lightning
 strikes
 is
 rare,
 but
 worldwide
 it
 causes
 1000
deaths
 each
 year.353 Unconscious
 patients
 with
 linear
 or
 punctu-
ate
 burns
 (feathering)
 should
 be
 treated
 as
 victims
 of
 lightning
strike.354 Severe
 burns
 (thermal
 or
 electrical),
 myocardial
 necro-
sis,
 the
 extent
 of
 central
 nervous
 system
 injury,
 and
 secondary
multisystem
 organ
 failure
 determine
 the
 morbidity
 and
 long-term
prognosis.
Mass
 casualty
 incidents
Use
 a
 triage
 system
 to
 prioritise
 treatment.
 The
 decision
 to
 use
 a
mass
 casualty
 incident
 (MCI)
 triage
 sieve,
 and
 withhold
 CPR
 to
 those
with
 imminent
 death,
 (including
 victims
 without
 signs
 of
 life),
 is
the
 responsibility
 of
 a
 medical
 commander
 who
 is
 usually
 the
 most
experienced
 EMS
 clinician
 on
 scene.
 Training
 allows
 fast
 and
 correct
recognition
 of
 those
 needing
 life-saving
 procedures,
 and
 reduces
the
 risk
 of
 inappropriate
 care
 given
 to
 futile
 cases.
Special
 patients
Cardiac
 arrest
 associated
 with
 concomitant
 diseases
Asthma.
 The
 majority
 of
 asthma-related
 deaths
 occur
 before
admission
 to
 hospital.355
Cardiac
 arrest
 in
 a
 person
 with
 asthma
 is
 often
 a
 terminal
 event
after
 a
 period
 of
 hypoxaemia.
 Modiﬁcations
 to
 standard
 ALS
 guide-
lines
 include
 considering
 the
 need
 for
 early
 tracheal
 intubation.
 If
dynamic
 hyperinﬂation
 of
 the
 lungs
 is
 suspected
 during
 CPR,
 com-
pression
 of
 the
 chest
 while
 disconnecting
 tracheal
 tube
 may
 relieve
air
 trapping.
Patients
 with
 ventricular
 assist
 devices.
 Conﬁrming
 cardiac
 arrest
 in
these
 patients
 may
 be
 difﬁcult.
 A
 patient
 with
 invasive
 monitoring
should
 be
 considered
 to
 have
 arrested
 if
 the
 arterial
 line
 reads
 the
same
 as
 the
 central
 venous
 pressure
 (CVP)
 line.
 In
 patients
 with-
out
 invasive
 monitoring,
 if
 the
 patient
 has
 no
 signs
 of
 life
 and
 is
not
 breathing,
 then
 they
 should
 be
 considered
 to
 have
 suffered
 a
cardiac
 arrest.
 Patients
 with
 an
 implantable
 left
 ventricular
 assist
device
 (LVAD)
 should
 have
 the
 same
 algorithm
 followed
 as
 the
algorithm
 for
 arrest
 after
 cardiac
 surgery.
 In
 pulseless
 electrical
activity
 (PEA),
 turn
 the
 pacing
 off
 and
 verify
 there
 is
 no
 underlying
VF,
 which
 must
 be
 treated
 by
 deﬁbrillation.
 External
 chest
 com-
pressions
 should
 be
 performed
 if
 immediate
 resuscitative
 efforts
fail.
 Importantly,
 the
 airway
 and
 breathing
 checks
 should
 always
be
 performed.
 It
 is
 possible
 for
 a
 patient
 to
 have
 asystole
 or
 VF,
but
 still
 have
 adequate
 cerebral
 blood
 ﬂow
 due
 to
 adequate
 and
continued
 pump
 ﬂow.
 If
 the
 patient
 is
 conscious
 and
 responding
then
 you
 will
 have
 more
 time
 in
 which
 to
 resolve
 this
 arrhythmia
and
 external
 chest
 compressions
 will
 not
 be
 needed.
 Resternotomy
should
 be
 performed
 in
 an
 established
 cardiac
 arrest
 within
 10
 days
of
 surgery.
Cardiac
 arrest
 associated
 with
 neurological
 disease.
 Cardiac
 arrest
associated
 with
 acute
 neurological
 disease
 is
 relatively
 uncommon
and
 can
 occur
 with
 subarachnoid
 haemorrhage,
 intracerebral
 hae-
morrhage,
 epileptic
 seizures,
 and
 ischaemic
 stroke.356 Cardiac
 or
respiratory
 arrest
 occurs
 in
 between
 3
 and
 11%
 of
 patents
 with
subarachnoid
 haemorrhage,357 and
 the
 initial
 rhythm
 is
 usually
non-shockable.
 However,
 patients
 with
 subarachnoid
 haemorr-
hage
 may
 have
 ECG
 changes
 that
 suggest
 an
 acute
 coronary
syndrome.358 Individuals
 with
 neurological
 prodromal
 symp-
toms
 who
 achieve
 ROSC
 may
 be
 considered
 for
 CT
 brain
 scan.
Whether
 this
 is
 done
 before
 or
 after
 coronary
 angiography
 will
depend
 on
 clinical
 judgement
 with
 consideration
 of
 the
 likeli-
hood
 of
 a
 subarachnoid
 haemorrhage
 versus
 an
 acute
 coronary
syndrome.4
Obesity.
 In
 2014,
 more
 than
 1.9
 billion
 (39%)
 adults
 were
 over-
weight,
 and
 of
 these
 over
 600
 million
 (13%)
 were
 obese.
 Traditional
cardiovascular
 risk
 factors
 (hypertension,
 diabetes,
 lipid
 proﬁle,
prevalent
 coronary
 heart
 disease,
 heart
 failure,
 and
 left
 ventri-
cular
 hypertrophy)
 are
 common
 in
 obese
 patients.
 Obesity
 is
associated
 with
 increased
 risk
 of
 sudden
 cardiac
 death.359 No
changes
 to
 the
 sequence
 of
 actions
 are
 recommended
 in
 resus-
citation
 of
 obese
 patients,
 but
 delivery
 of
 effective
 CPR
 may
 be
challenging.
Cardiac
 arrest
 associated
 with
 pregnancy
From
 20
 weeks’
 gestation,
 the
 uterus
 can
 compress
 both
 the
inferior
 vena
 cava
 (IVC)
 and
 aorta,
 impeding
 venous
 return
 and
 car-
diac
 output.
 The
 hand
 position
 for
 chest
 compressions
 may
 need
 to
be
 slightly
 higher
 on
 the
 sternum
 for
 patients
 with
 advanced
 preg-
nancy
 e.g.
 third
 trimester.360 Manually
 displace
 the
 uterus
 to
 the
left
 to
 reduce
 IVC
 compression.
 Add
 left
 lateral
 tilt
 if
 this
 is
 feasible
and
 ensure
 the
 chest
 remains
 supported
 on
 a
 ﬁrm
 surface
 (e.g.
 in
 the
operating
 room).
 Consider
 the
 need
 for
 an
 emergency
 hysterotomy
or
 Caesarean
 section
 as
 soon
 as
 a
 pregnant
 woman
 goes
 into
 cardiac
arrest.
 The
 best
 survival
 rate
 for
 infants
 over
 24–25
 weeks’
 gesta-
tion
 occurs
 when
 delivery
 of
 the
 infant
 is
 achieved
 within
 5
 min
after
 the
 mother’s
 cardiac
 arrest.361
Elderly
 people
More
 than
 50%
 of
 people
 resuscitated
 from
 OHCA
 are
 aged
 65
years
 or
 older.362 No
 modiﬁcations
 of
 standard
 resuscitation
 pro-
tocols
 are
 needed
 when
 managing
 aged
 patients
 in
 cardiac
 arrest.
Rescuers,
 however,
 should
 be
 aware
 that
 the
 risk
 of
 both
 sternal
 and
rib
 fractures
 is
 higher
 in
 elderly.363–365 The
 incidence
 of
 CPR-related
injuries
 increases
 with
 duration
 of
 CPR.365
Post-resuscitation
 care
Successful
 return
 of
 spontaneous
 circulation
 (ROSC)
 is
 the
 ﬁrst
step
 towards
 the
 goal
 of
 complete
 recovery
 from
 cardiac
 arrest.
The
 complex
 pathophysiological
 processes
 that
 occur
 following
whole
 body
 ischaemia
 during
 cardiac
 arrest
 and
 the
 subsequent
reperfusion
 response
 during
 CPR
 and
 following
 successful
 resus-
citation
 have
 been
 termed
 the
 post-cardiac
 arrest
 syndrome.366

Depending
 on
 the
 cause
 of
 the
 arrest,
 and
 the
 severity
 of
 the
post-cardiac
 arrest
 syndrome,
 many
 patients
 will
 require
 mul-
tiple
 organ
 support
 and
 the
 treatment
 they
 receive
 during
 this
post-resuscitation
 period
 inﬂuences
 signiﬁcantly
 the
 overall
 out-
come
 and
 particularly
 the
 quality
 of
 neurological
 recovery.367–373
The
 post-resuscitation
 care
 algorithm
 (Fig.
 1.15)
 outlines
 some
of
 the
 key
 interventions
 required
 to
 optimise
 outcome
 for
 these
patients.
Post-cardiac
 arrest
 syndrome
The
 post-cardiac
 arrest
 syndrome
 comprises
 post-cardiac
 arrest
brain
 injury,
 post-cardiac
 arrest
 myocardial
 dysfunction,
 the
systemic
 ischaemia/reperfusion
 response,
 and
 the
 persistent
 pre-
cipitating
 pathology.366,374,375 The
 severity
 of
 this
 syndrome
 will
vary
 with
 the
 duration
 and
 cause
 of
 cardiac
 arrest.
 It
 may
 not
occur
 at
 all
 if
 the
 cardiac
 arrest
 is
 brief.
 Cardiovascular
 failure
accounts
 for
 most
 deaths
 in
 the
 ﬁrst
 three
 days,
 while
 brain
injury
 accounts
 for
 most
 of
 the
 later
 deaths.376–378 Withdrawal
of
 life
 sustaining
 therapy
 (WLST)
 is
 the
 most
 frequent
 cause
 of
death
 (approximately
 50%)
 in
 patients
 with
 a
 prognosticated
 bad
outcome,378,379 emphasising
 the
 importance
 of
 the
 prognostica-
tion
 plan
 (see
 below).
 Post-cardiac
 arrest
 brain
 injury
 may
 be
exacerbated
 by
 microcirculatory
 failure,
 impaired
 autoregulation,
hypotension,
 hypercarbia,
 hypoxaemia,
 hyperoxaemia,
 pyrexia,
hypoglycaemia,
 hyperglycaemia
 and
 seizures.
 Signiﬁcant
 myocar-
dial
 dysfunction
 is
 common
 after
 cardiac
 arrest
 but
 typically
 starts
to
 recover
 by
 2–3
 days,
 although
 full
 recovery
 may
 take
 signif-
icantly
 longer.380–382 The
 whole
 body
 ischaemia/reperfusion
 of
cardiac
 arrest
 activates
 immune
 and
 coagulation
 pathways
 con-
tributing
 to
 multiple
 organ
 failure
 and
 increasing
 the
 risk
 of
infection.383 Thus,
 the
 post-cardiac
 arrest
 syndrome
 has
 many
features
 in
 common
 with
 sepsis,
 including
 intravascular
 volume
depletion,
 vasodilation,
 endothelial
 injury
 and
 abnormalties
 of
 the
microcirculation.384–390
Airway
 and
 breathing
Hypoxaemia
 and
 hypercarbia
 both
 increase
 the
 likelihood
 of
 a
further
 cardiac
 arrest
 and
 may
 contribute
 to
 secondary
 brain
 injury.
Several
 animal
 studies
 indicate
 that
 hyperoxaemia
 early
 after
 ROSC
causes
 oxidative
 stress
 and
 harms
 post-ischaemic
 neurones.391
Virtually
 all
 human
 data
 is
 derived
 from
 intensive
 care
 unit
 reg-
istries
 and
 they
 have
 produced
 conﬂicting
 results
 on
 the
 potential
impact
 of
 hyperoxaemia
 after
 resuscitation
 from
 cardiac
 arrest.392
A
 recent
 study
 of
 air
 versus
 supplemental
 oxygen
 in
 ST-elevation
myocardial
 infarction
 showed
 that
 supplemental
 oxygen
 therapy
increased
 myocardial
 injury,
 recurrent
 myocardial
 infarction
 and
major
 cardiac
 arrhythmia
 and
 was
 associated
 with
 larger
 infarct
size
 at
 6
 months.393 Given
 the
 evidence
 of
 harm
 after
 myocardial
infarction
 and
 the
 possibility
 of
 increased
 neurological
 injury
 after
cardiac
 arrest,
 as
 soon
 as
 arterial
 blood
 oxygen
 saturation
 can
 be
monitored
 reliably
 (by
 blood
 gas
 analysis
 and/or
 pulse
 oximetry),
titrate
 the
 inspired
 oxygen
 concentration
 to
 maintain
 the
 arterial
blood
 oxygen
 saturation
 in
 the
 range
 of
 94–98%.
 Avoid
 hypox-
aemia,
 which
 is
 also
 harmful
 –
 ensure
 reliable
 measurement
 of
arterial
 oxygen
 saturation
 before
 reducing
 the
 inspired
 oxygen
concentration.
Consider
 tracheal
 intubation,
 sedation
 and
 controlled
 ventila-
tion
 in
 any
 patient
 with
 obtunded
 cerebral
 function.
 After
 cardiac
arrest,
 hypocapnia
 induced
 by
 hyperventilation
 causes
 cerebral
ischaemia.394–396 Observational
 studies
 using
 cardiac
 arrest
 reg-
istries
 document
 an
 association
 between
 hypocapnia
 and
 poor
neurological
 outcome.397,398 Until
 prospective
 data
 are
 available,
it
 is
 reasonable
 to
 adjust
 ventilation
 to
 achieve
 normocarbia
 and
to
 monitor
 this
 using
 the
 end-tidal
 CO2 and
 arterial
 blood
 gas
values.
Circulation
Acute
 coronary
 syndrome
 (ACS)
 is
 a
 frequent
 cause
 of
 out-
of-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
 (OHCA):
 in
 a
 recent
 meta-analysis,
 the
prevalence
 of
 an
 acute
 coronary
 artery
 lesion
 ranged
 from
 59%
 to
71%
 in
 OHCA
 patients
 without
 an
 obvious
 non-cardiac
 aetiology.399
Many
 observational
 studies
 have
 shown
 that
 emergent
 cardiac
catheterisation
 laboratory
 evaluation,
 including
 early
 percuta-
neous
 coronary
 intervention
 (PCI),
 is
 feasible
 in
 patients
 with
 ROSC
after
 cardiac
 arrest.400,401 The
 invasive
 management
 (i.e.
 early
 coro-
nary
 angiography
 followed
 by
 immediate
 PCI
 if
 necessary)
 of these
patients,
 particularly
 those
 having
 prolonged
 resuscitation
 and
nonspeciﬁc
 ECG
 changes,
 has
 been
 controversial
 because
 of
 the
 lack
of
 speciﬁc
 evidence
 and
 signiﬁcant
 implications
 on
 use
 of
 resources
(including
 transfer
 of
 patients
 to
 PCI
 centres).
Percutaneous
 coronary
 intervention
 following
 ROSC
 with
ST-Elevation
Based
 on
 available
 data,
 emergent
 cardiac
 catheterisation
 lab-
oratory
 evaluation
 (and
 immediate
 PCI
 if
 required)
 should
 be
performed
 in
 adult
 patients
 with
 ROSC
 after
 OHCA
 of
 suspected
cardiac
 origin
 with
 STE
 on
 the
 ECG.
 This
 recommendation
 is
based
 on
 low
 quality
 of
 evidence
 from
 selected
 populations.
Observational
 studies
 also
 indicate
 that
 optimal
 outcomes
 after
OHCA
 are
 achieved
 with
 a
 combination
 of
 TTM
 and
 PCI,
 which
can
 be
 included
 in
 a
 standardised
 post–cardiac
 arrest
 protocol
as
 part
 of
 an
 overall
 strategy
 to
 improve
 neurologically
 intact
survival.401–403
Percutaneous
 coronary
 intervention
 following
 ROSC
 without
ST-Elevation
In
 contrast
 to
 the
 usual
 presentation
 of
 ACS
 in
 non-cardiac
 arrest
patients,
 the
 standard
 tools
 to
 assess
 coronary
 ischaemia
 in
 car-
diac
 arrest
 patients
 are
 less
 accurate.
 The
 sensitivity
 and
 speciﬁcity
of
 the
 usual
 clinical
 data,
 ECG
 and
 biomarkers
 to
 predict
 an
 acute
coronary
 artery
 occlusion
 as
 the
 cause
 of
 OHCA
 are
 unclear.404–407
Several
 large
 observational
 series
 showed
 that
 absence
 of
 STE
may
 also
 be
 associated
 with
 ACS
 in
 patients
 with
 ROSC
 following
OHCA.408–411 In
 these
 non-STE
 patients,
 there
 are
 conﬂicting
 data
from
 observational
 studies
 on
 the
 potential
 beneﬁt
 of
 emergent
cardiac
 catheterization
 laboratory
 evaluation.410,412,413 It
 is
 rea-
sonable
 to
 discuss
 and
 consider
 emergent
 cardiac
 catheterisation
laboratory
 evaluation
 after
 ROSC
 in
 patients
 with
 the
 highest
 risk
of
 a
 coronary
 cause
 for
 their
 cardiac
 arrest.
 Factors
 such
 as
 patient
age,
 duration
 of
 CPR,
 haemodynamic
 instability,
 presenting
 cardiac
rhythm,
 neurological
 status
 upon
 hospital
 arrival,
 and
 perceived
likelihood
 of
 cardiac
 aetiology
 can
 inﬂuence
 the
 decision
 to
undertake
 the
 intervention
 in
 the
 acute
 phase
 or
 to
 delay
 it
 until
later
 on
 in
 the
 hospital
 stay.
Indications
 and
 timing
 of
 computed
 tomography
 (CT)
 scanning
Cardiac
 causes
 of
 OHCA
 have
 been
 extensively
 studied
 in
 the
 last
few
 decades;
 conversely,
 little
 is
 known
 about
 non-cardiac
 causes.
Early
 identiﬁcation
 of
 a
 respiratory
 or
 neurological
 cause
 would
enable
 transfer
 of
 the
 patient
 to
 a
 specialised
 ICU
 for
 optimal
 care.
Improved
 knowledge
 of
 prognosis
 also
 enables
 discussion
 about
 the
appropriateness
 of
 speciﬁc
 therapies,
 including
 TTM.
 Early
 identi-
ﬁcation
 of
 a
 respiratory
 or
 neurological
 cause
 can
 be
 achieved
 by
performing
 a
 brain
 and
 chest
 CT-scan
 at
 hospital
 admission,
 before
or
 after
 coronary
 angiography.
 In
 the
 absence
 of
 signs
 or
 symp-
toms
 suggesting
 a
 neurological
 or
 respiratory
 cause
 (e.g.
 headache,
seizures
 or
 neurological
 deﬁcits
 for
 neurological
 causes,
 short-
ness
 of
 breath
 or
 documented
 hypoxia
 in

a
 known
 and
 worsening
 respiratpry
 disease)
 or
 if
 there
 is
 clinical
or
 ECG
 evidence
 of
 myocardial
 ischaemia,
 coronary
 angiography
 is
undertaken
 ﬁrst,
 followed
 by
 CT
 scan
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 causative
lesions.
 Several
 case
 series
 showed
 that
 this
 strategy
 enables
 diag-
nosis
 of
 non-cardiac
 causes
 of
 arrest
 in
 a
 substantial
 proportion
 of
patients.358,414
Haemodynamic
 management
Post-resuscitation
 
myocardial
 
dysfunction
 
causes
haemodynamic
 
instability,
 
which
 
manifests
 
as
 
hypotension,
low
 cardiac
 index
 and
 arrhythmias.380,415 Perform
 early
 echocar-
diography
 in
 all
 patients
 in
 order
 to
 detect
 and
 quantify
 the
 degree
of
 myocardial
 dysfunction.381,416 Post-resuscitation
 myocardial
dysfunction
 often
 requires
 inotropic
 support,
 at
 least
 transiently.
Treatment
 may
 be
 guided
 by
 blood
 pressure,
 heart
 rate,
 urine
output,
 rate
 of
 plasma
 lactate
 clearance,
 and
 central
 venous
 oxygen
saturation.
 Serial
 echocardiography
 may
 also
 be
 used,
 especially
 in
haemodynamically
 unstable
 patients.
 In
 the
 ICU
 an
 arterial
 line
 for
continuous
 blood
 pressure
 monitoring
 is
 essential.
Similarly
 to
 the
 early
 goal-directed
 therapy
 that
 is
 recom-
mended
 in
 the
 treatment
 of
 sepsis, 417 although
 challenged
 by
several
 recent
 studies,418–420 a
 bundle
 of
 therapies,
 including
 a
speciﬁc
 blood
 pressure
 target,
 has
 been
 proposed
 as
 a
 treatment
strategy
 after
 cardiac
 arrest.370 In
 the
 absence
 of
 deﬁnitive
 data,
target
 the
 mean
 arterial
 blood
 pressure
 to
 achieve
 an
 adequate
urine
 output
 (1
 ml
 kg−1 h−1) and
 normal
 or
 decreasing
 plasma
 lac-
tate
 values,
 taking
 into
 consideration
 the
 patient’s
 normal
 blood
pressure,
 the
 cause
 of
 the
 arrest
 and
 the
 severity
 of
 any
 myocardial
dysfunction.366 These
 targets
 may
 vary
 depending
 on
 individual
physiology
 and
 co-morbid
 status.
 Importantly,
 hypothermia
 may
increase
 urine
 output421 and
 impair
 lactate
 clearance.415
Implantable
 cardioverter
 deﬁbrillators
Consider
 insertion
 of
 an
 implantable
 cardioverter
 deﬁbrillator
(ICD)
 in
 ischaemic
 patients
 with
 signiﬁcant
 left
 ventricular
 dysfunc-
tion,
 who
 have
 been
 resuscitated
 from
 a
 ventricular
 arrhythmia
 that
occurred
 later
 than
 24–48
 h
 after
 a
 primary
 coronary
 event.422–424
Disability
 (optimising
 neurological
 recovery)
Cerebral
 perfusion
Animal
 studies
 show
 that
 immediately
 after
 ROSC
 there
 is
 a
short
 period
 of
 multifocal
 cerebral
 no-reﬂow
 followed
 by
 transient
global
 cerebral
 hyperaemia
 lasting
 15–30
 min.425–427 This
 is
 fol-
lowed
 by
 up
 to
 24
 h
 of
 cerebral
 hypoperfusion
 while
 the
 cerebral
metabolic
 rate
 of
 oxygen
 gradually
 recovers.
 After
 asphyxial
 car-
diac
 arrest,
 brain
 oedema
 may
 occur
 transiently
 after
 ROSC
 but
 it
is
 rarely
 associated
 with
 clinically
 relevant
 increases
 in
 intracra-
nial
 pressure.428,429 In
 many
 patients,
 autoregulation
 of
 cerebral
blood
 ﬂow
 is
 impaired
 (absent
 or
 right-shifted)
 for
 some
 time
 after
cardiac
 arrest,
 which
 means
 that
 cerebral
 perfusion
 varies
 with
cerebral
 perfusion
 pressure
 instead
 of
 being
 linked
 to
 neuronal
activity.430,431 Thus,
 after
 ROSC,
 maintain
 mean
 arterial
 pressure
near
 the
 patient’s
 normal
 level.12
Sedation
Although
 it
 has
 been
 common
 practice
 to
 sedate
 and
 ventilate
patients
 for
 at
 least
 24
 h
 after
 ROSC,
 there
 are
 no
 high-level
 data
 to
support
 a
 deﬁned
 period
 of
 ventilation,
 sedation
 and
 neuromuscu-
lar
 blockade
 after
 cardiac
 arrest.
Control
 of
 seizures
Seizures
 are
 common
 after
 cardiac
 arrest
 and
 occur
 in
 approx-
imately
 one-third
 of
 patients
 who
 remain
 comatose
 after
 ROSC.
Myoclonus
 is
 most
 common
 and
 occurs
 in
 18–25%,
 the
 remainder
having
 focal
 or
 generalised
 tonic–clonic
 seizures
 or
 a
 combination
of
 seizure
 types.376,432–434 Clinical
 seizures,
 including
 myoclonus
may
 or
 may
 not
 be
 of
 epileptic
 origin.
 Other
 motor
 manifestations
could
 be
 mistaken
 for
 seizures
 and
 there
 are
 several
 types
 of
myoclonus,
 the
 majority
 being
 non-epileptic.435,436 Use
 intermit-
tent
 electroencephalography
 (EEG)
 to
 detect
 epileptic
 activity
 in
patients
 with
 clinical
 seizure
 manifestations.
 Consider
 continuous
EEG
 to
 monitor
 patients
 with
 a
 diagnosed
 status
 epilepticus
 and
effects
 of
 treatment.
 Seizures
 may
 increase
 the
 cerebral
 metabolic
rate437 and
 have
 the
 potential
 to
 exacerbate
 brain
 injury
 caused
by
 cardiac
 arrest:
 treat
 with
 sodium
 valproate,
 levetiracetam,
phenytoin,
 benzodiazepines,
 propofol,
 or
 a
 barbiturate.
 Myoclonus
can
 be
 particularly
 difﬁcult
 to
 treat;
 phenytoin
 is
 often
 ineffective.
Propofol
 is
 effective
 to
 suppress
 post-anoxic
 myoclonus.438 Clon-
azepam,
 sodium
 valproate
 and
 levetiracetam
 are
 antimyoclonic
drugs
 that
 may
 be
 effective
 in
 post-anoxic
 myoclonus.436
Glucose
 control
There
 is
 a
 strong
 association
 between
 high
 blood
 glucose
after
 resuscitation
 from
 cardiac
 arrest
 and
 poor
 neurological
outcome.261,439,440 Based
 on
 the
 available
 data,
 following
 ROSC
maintain
 the
 blood
 glucose
 at
 ≤10
 mmol
 l−1 (180
 mg  dl−1) and
avoid
 hypoglycaemia.441 Do
 not
 implement
 strict
 glucose
 control
in
 adult
 patients
 with
 ROSC
 after
 cardiac
 arrest
 because
 it
 increases
the
 risk
 of
 hypoglycaemia.
Temperature
 control
A
 period
 of
 hyperthermia
 (hyperpyrexia)
 is
 common
 in
 the
ﬁrst
 48
 h
 after
 cardiac
 arrest.261,442–445 Several
 studies
 docu-
ment
 an
 association
 between
 post-cardiac
 arrest
 pyrexia
 and
 poor
outcomes.261,442,444–447 Although
 the
 effect
 of
 elevated
 temper-
ature
 on
 outcome
 is
 not
 proven,
 it
 seems
 reasonable
 to
 treat
hyperthermia
 occurring
 after
 cardiac
 arrest
 with
 antipyretics
 and
to
 consider
 active
 cooling
 in
 unconscious
 patients.
Animal
 and
 human
 data
 indicate
 that
 mild
 induced
 hypothermia
is
 neuroprotective
 and
 improves
 outcome
 after
 a
 period
 of
 global
cerebral
 hypoxia-ischaemia.448,449 All
 studies
 of
 post-cardiac
 arrest
mild
 induced
 hypothermia
 have
 included
 only
 patients
 in
 coma.
One
 randomised
 trial
 and
 a
 pseudo-randomised
 trial
 demon-
strated
 improved
 neurological
 outcome
 at
 hospital
 discharge
 or
at
 6
 months
 in
 comatose
 patients
 after
 out-of-hospital
 VF
 cardiac
arrest.450,451 Cooling
 was
 initiated
 within
 minutes
 to
 hours
 after
ROSC
 and
 a
 temperature
 range
 of
 32–34 ◦C
 was
 maintained
 for
12–24
 h.
In
 the
 Targeted
 Temperature
 Management
 (TTM)
 trial,
 950
 all-
rhythm
 OHCA
 patients
 were
 randomised
 to
 36
 h
 of
 temperature
control
 (comprising
 28
 h
 at
 the
 target
 temperature
 followed
 by
 slow
rewarm)
 at
 either
 33 ◦C
 or
 36 ◦C.376 Strict
 protocols
 were
 followed
for
 assessing
 prognosis
 and
 for
 withdrawal
 of
 life-sustaining
 treat-
ment
 (WLST).
 There
 was
 no
 difference
 in
 the
 primary
 outcome
 –
all
 cause
 mortality,
 and
 neurological
 outcome
 at
 6
 months
 was
 also
similar
 (hazard
 ratio
 (HR)
 for
 mortality
 at
 end
 of
 trial
 1.06,
 95%
 CI
0.89–1.28;
 relative
 risk
 (RR)
 for
 death
 or
 poor
 neurological
 outcome
at
 6
 months
 1.02,
 95%
 CI
 0.88–1.16).
 Detailed
 neurological
 outcome
at
 6
 months
 was
 also
 similar.452,453 Importantly,
 patients
 in
 both
arms
 of
 this
 trial
 had
 their
 temperature
 well
 controlled
 so
 that
 fever
was
 prevented
 in
 both
 groups.
The
 term
 targeted
 temperature
 management
 or
 temperature
control
 is
 now
 preferred
 over
 the
 previous
 term
 therapeutic
hypothermia.
 The
 ALS
 Task
 Force
 of
 the
 International
 Liaison
 Com-
mittee
 on
 Resuscitation
 made
 several
 treatment
 recommendations
on
 targeted
 temperature
 management175 and
 these
 are
 reﬂected
 in
these
 ERC
 guidelines:
• Maintain
 a
 constant,
 target
 temperature
 between
 32 ◦C
 and
 36 ◦C
for
 those
 patients
 in
 whom
 temperature
 control
 is
 used
 (strong
recommendation,
 moderate-quality
 evidence).

• Whether
 certain
 subpopulations
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
 patients
 may
beneﬁt
 from
 lower
 (32–34 ◦C)
 or
 higher
 (36 ◦C)
 temperatures
remains
 unknown,
 and
 further
 research
 may
 help
 elucidate
 this.
• TTM
 is
 recommended
 for
 adults
 after
 OHCA
 with
 an
 initial
shockable
 rhythm
 who
 remain
 unresponsive
 after
 ROSC
 (strong
recommendation,
 low-quality
 evidence).
• TTM
 is
 suggested
 for
 adults
 after
 OHCA
 with
 an
 initial
 non-
shockable
 rhythm
 who
 remain
 unresponsive
 after
 ROSC
 (weak
recommendation,
 very
 low-quality
 evidence).
• TTM
 is
 suggested
 for
 adults
 after
 IHCA
 with
 any
 initial
 rhythm
who
 remain
 unresponsive
 after
 ROSC
 (weak
 recommendation,
very
 low-quality
 evidence).
• If targeted
 temperature
 management
 is
 used,
 it
 is
 suggested
 that
the
 duration
 is
 at
 least
 24
 h
 (as
 undertaken
 in
 the
 two
 largest
previous
 RCTs376,450)
 (weak
 recommendation,
 very
 low-quality
evidence).
When
 to
 control
 temperature?.
 Whichever
 target
 temperature
 is
selected,
 active
 temperature
 control
 is
 required
 to
 achieve
 and
maintain
 the
 temperature
 in
 this
 range.
 Prior
 recommendations
suggest
 that
 cooling
 should
 be
 initiated
 as
 soon
 as
 possible
 after
ROSC,
 but
 this
 recommendation
 was
 based
 only
 on
 preclinical
 data
and
 rational
 conjecture.454 Animal
 data
 indicate
 that
 earlier
 cooling
after
 ROSC
 produces
 better
 outcomes.455,456 Observational
 studies
are
 confounded
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 is
 an
 association
 between
patients
 who
 cool
 faster
 spontaneously
 and
 worse
 neurological
outcome.457–459 It
 is
 hypothesised
 that
 those
 with
 the
 most
 severe
neurological
 injury
 are
 more
 prone
 to
 losing
 their
 ability
 to
 control
body
 temperature.
A randomised
 trial
 of
 prehospital
 cooling
 using
 a
 rapid
 infusion
of
 large
 volumes
 of
 cold
 intravenous
 ﬂuid
 immediately
 after
 ROSC
versus
 cooling
 delayed
 until
 hospital
 admission
 showed
 increased
rates
 of
 re-arrest
 during
 transport
 and
 pulmonary
 oedema.460
Although
 uncontrolled
 prehospital
 infusion
 of
 cold
 ﬂuid
 is
 not
 rec-
ommended,
 it
 may
 still
 be
 reasonable
 to
 infuse
 cold
 intravenous
ﬂuid
 where
 patients
 are
 well
 monitored
 and
 a
 lower
 target
 tem-
perature
 (e.g.
 33 ◦C)
 is
 the
 goal.
 Early
 cooling
 strategies,
 other
 than
rapid
 infusion
 of
 large
 volumes
 of
 cold
 intravenous
 ﬂuid,
 and
 cool-
ing
 during
 cardiopulmonary
 resuscitation
 in
 the
 prehospital
 setting
have
 not
 been
 studied
 adequately.
How
 to
 control
 temperature?.
 As
 yet,
 there
 are
 no
 data
 indicating
that
 any
 speciﬁc
 cooling
 technique
 increases
 survival
 when
 com-
pared
 with
 any
 other
 cooling
 technique;
 however,
 internal
 devices
enable
 more
 precise
 temperature
 control
 compared
 with
 external
techniques.461,462 Rebound
 hyperthermia
 is
 associated
 with
 worse
neurological
 outcome.463,464 Thus,
 rewarming
 should
 be
 achieved
slowly:
 the
 optimal
 rate
 is
 not
 known,
 but
 the
 consensus
 is
 cur-
rently
 about
 0.25–0.5 ◦C
 of
 rewarming
 per
 hour.465
Prognostication
This
 section
 on
 prognostication
 has
 been
 adapted
 from
 the
 Advi-
sory
 Statement
 on
 Neurological
 Prognostication
 in
 comatose
 survivors
of
 cardiac
 arrest,466 written
 by
 members
 of
 the
 ERC
 ALS
 Working
 Group
and
 of
 the
 Trauma
 and
 Emergency
 Medicine
 (TEM)
 Section
 of
 the
 Euro-
pean
 Society
 of
 Intensive
 Care
 Medicine
 (ESICM),
 in
 anticipation
 of
 the
2015
 Guidelines.
Hypoxic-ischaemic
 brain
 injury
 is
 common
 after
 resuscitation
from
 cardiac
 arrest.467 Two
 thirds
 of
 those
 dying
 after
 admission
to
 ICU
 following
 out-of-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
 die
 from
 neurolog-
ical
 injury;
 this
 has
 been
 shown
 both
 before468 and
 after376–378
the
 implementation
 of
 target
 temperature
 management
 (TTM)
 for
post-resuscitation
 care.
 Most
 of
 these
 deaths
 are
 due
 to
 active
withdrawal
 of
 life
 sustaining
 treatment
 (WLST)
 based
 on
 prog-
nostication
 of
 a
 poor
 neurological
 outcome.377,378 For
 this
 reason,
when
 dealing
 with
 patients
 who
 are
 comatose
 after
 resuscitation
from
 cardiac
 arrest
 minimising
 the
 risk
 of
 a
 falsely
 pessimistic
prediction
 is
 essential.
 Ideally,
 when
 predicting
 a
 poor
 outcome
the
 false
 positive
 rate
 (FPR)
 should
 be
 zero
 with
 the
 narrowest
possible
 conﬁdence
 interval
 (CI).
 However,
 most
 prognostication
studies
 include
 so
 few
 patients
 that
 even
 if
 the
 FPR
 is
 0%,
 the
 upper
limit
 of
 the
 95%
 CI
 is
 often
 high.469,470 Moreover,
 many
 studies
 are
confounded
 by
 self-fulﬁlling
 prophecy,
 which
 is
 a
 bias
 occurring
when
 the
 treating
 physicians
 are
 not
 blinded
 to
 the
 results
 of
 the
outcome
 predictor
 and
 use
 it
 to
 make
 a
 decision
 on
 WLST.469,471
Finally,
 both
 TTM
 itself
 and
 sedatives
 or
 neuromuscular
 blocking
drugs
 used
 to
 maintain
 it
 may
 potentially
 interfere
 with
 prognosti-
cation
 indices,
 especially
 those
 based
 on
 clinical
 examination.472
A
 multimodal
 approach
 to
 prognostication
 is
 essential
 and
includes:
 clinical
 examination,
 electrophysiology,
 biomarkers
 and
imaging.
A
 careful
 clinical
 neurological
 examination
 remains
 the
 foun-
dation
 for
 prognostication
 of
 the
 comatose
 patient
 after
 cardiac
arrest.473 Perform
 a
 thorough
 clinical
 examination
 daily
 to
 detect
signs
 of
 neurological
 recovery
 such
 as
 purposeful
 movements
 or
 to
identify
 a
 clinical
 picture
 suggesting
 that
 brain
 death
 has
 occurred.
The
 process
 of
 brain
 recovery
 following
 global
 post-anoxic
injury
 is
 completed
 within
 72
 h
 from
 arrest
 in
 most
 patients.474,475
However,
 in
 patients
 who
 have
 received
 sedatives
 ≤12
 h
 before
 the
72
 h
 post-ROSC
 neurological
 assessment,
 the
 reliability
 of
 clinical
examination
 may
 be
 reduced.472 Before
 decisive
 assessment
 is
 per-
formed,
 major
 confounders
 must
 be
 excluded;476,477 apart
 from
sedation
 and
 neuromuscular
 blockade,
 these
 include
 hypothermia,
severe
 hypotension,
 hypoglycaemia,
 and
 metabolic
 and
 respiratory
derangements.
 Suspend
 sedatives
 and
 neuromuscular
 blocking
drugs
 for
 long
 enough
 to
 avoid
 interference
 with
 clinical
 exami-
nation.
 Short-acting
 drugs
 are
 preferred
 whenever
 possible.
 When
residual
 sedation/paralysis
 is
 suspected,
 consider
 using
 antidotes
to
 reverse
 the
 effects
 of
 these
 drugs.
The
 prognostication
 strategy
 algorithm
 (Fig.
 1.16) is
 applicable
to
 all
 patients
 who
 remain
 comatose
 with
 an
 absent
 or
 extensor
motor
 response
 to
 pain
 at
 ≥72
 h
 from
 ROSC.
 Results
 of
 earlier
 pro-
gnostic
 tests
 are
 also
 considered
 at
 this
 time
 point.
Evaluate
 the
 most
 robust
 predictors
 ﬁrst.
 These
 predictors
 have
the
 highest
 speciﬁcity
 and
 precision
 (FPR
 <5%
 with
 95%
 CIs
 <5%
in
 patients
 treated
 with
 controlled
 temperature)
 and
 have
 been
documented
 in
 several
 studies
 from
 at
 least
 three
 different
 groups
of
 investigators.
 They
 include
 bilaterally
 absent
 pupillary
 reﬂexes
at
 ≥72
 h
 from
 ROSC
 and
 bilaterally
 absent
 somatosensory
 evoked
potential
 (SSEP)
 N20
 wave
 after
 rewarming
 (this
 last
 sign
 can
 be
evaluated
 at
 ≥24
 h
 from
 ROSC
 in
 patients
 who
 have
 not
 been
 treated
with
 controlled
 temperature).
 Based
 on
 expert
 opinion,
 we
 suggest
combining
 the
 absence
 of
 pupillary
 reﬂexes
 with
 those
 of
 corneal
reﬂexes
 for
 predicting
 poor
 outcome
 at
 this
 time
 point.
 Ocular
reﬂexes
 and
 SSEPs
 maintain
 their
 predictive
 value
 irrespective
 of
target
 temperature.478,479
If
 none
 of
 the
 signs
 above
 is
 present
 to
 predict
 a
 poor
 outcome,
a
 group
 of
 less
 accurate
 predictors
 can
 be
 evaluated,
 but
 the
 degree
of
 conﬁdence
 in
 their
 prediction
 will
 be
 lower.
 These
 have
 FPR
 <
 5%
but
 wider
 95%
 CIs
 than
 the
 previous
 predictors,
 and/or
 their
 def-
inition/threshold
 is
 inconsistent
 in
 prognostication
 studies.
 These
predictors
 include
 the
 presence
 of
 early
 status
 myoclonus
 (within
48
 h
 from
 ROSC),
 high
 values
 of
 serum
 neuron
 speciﬁc
 enolase
 (NSE)
at
 48–72
 h
 after
 ROSC,
 an
 unreactive
 malignant
 EEG
 pattern
 (burst-
suppression,
 status
 epilepticus)
 after
 rewarming,
 the
 presence
 of
a
 marked
 reduction
 of
 the
 grey
 matter
 to
 white
 matter
 (GM/WM)
ratio
 or
 sulcal
 effacement
 on
 brain
 CT
 within
 24
 h
 after
 ROSC
 or
 the
presence
 of
 diffuse
 ischaemic
 changes
 on
 brain
 magnetic
 resonance
imaging
 (MRI)
 at
 2–5
 days
 after
 ROSC.
 Based
 on
 expert
 opinion,
 we
suggest
 waiting
 at
 least
 24
 h
 after
 the
 ﬁrst
 prognostication
 assess-
ment
 and
 conﬁrming

the
 risk
 of
 false
 positive
 results.480
Although
 the
 most
 robust
 predictors
 showed
 no
 false
 positives
in
 most
 studies,
 none
 of
 them
 singularly
 predicts
 poor
 outcome
with
 absolute
 certainty.
 Moreover,
 those
 predictors
 have
 often
 been
used
 for
 WLST
 decisions,
 with
 the
 risk
 of
 a
 self-fulﬁlling
 prophecy.
For
 this
 reason,
 we
 recommend
 that
 prognostication
 should
 be
multimodal
 whenever
 possible,
 even
 in
 presence
 of
 one
 of
 these
predictors.
 Apart
 from
 increasing
 safety,
 limited
 evidence
 also
 sug-
gests
 that
 multimodal
 prognostication
 increases
 sensitivity.481–484
When
 dealing
 with
 an
 uncertain
 outcome,
 clinicians
 should
 con-
sider
 prolonged
 observation.
 Absence
 of
 clinical
 improvement
 over
time
 suggests
 a
 worse
 outcome.
 Although
 awakening
 has
 been
described
 as
 late
 as
 25
 days
 after
 arrest,485–487 most
 survivors
will
 recover
 consciousness
 within
 one
 week.376,488–491 In
 a
 recent
observational
 study,490 94%
 of
 patients
 awoke
 within
 4.5
 days
 from
rewarming
 and
 the
 remaining
 6%
 awoke
 within
 ten
 days.
 Even
those
 awakening
 late
 can
 still
 have
 a
 good
 neurological
 outcome.490
Rehabilitation
Although
 neurological
 outcome
 is
 considered
 to
 be
 good
 for
the
 majority
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
 survivors,
 cognitive
 and
 emotional
problems
 and
 fatigue
 are
 common.452,492–494 Long-term
 cognitive
impairments,
 mostly
 mild,
 are
 present
 in
 half
 of
 survivors.453,495,496
Mild
 cognitive
 problems
 are
 often
 not
 recognised
 by
 health
care
 professionals
 and
 cannot
 be
 detected
 with
 standard
 out-
come
 scales
 such
 as
 the
 Cerebral
 Performance
 Categories
 (CPC)
or
 the
 Mini-Mental
 State
 Examination
 (MMSE).452,497 Both
 cog-
nitive
 and
 emotional
 problems
 have
 signiﬁcant
 impact
 and
 can
affect
 a
 patient’s
 daily
 functioning,
 return
 to
 work
 and
 quality
 of
life.494,498,499 after
 hospital
 discharge
 should
 be
 organised
 system-
atically
 and
 can
 be
 provided
 by
 a
 physician
 or
 specialised
 nurse.
 It
should
 at
 least
 include
 screening
 for
 cognitive
 impairments
 and
 for
emotional
 problems,
 and
 the
 provision
 of
 information.
Organ
 donation
Organ
 donation
 should
 be
 considered
 in
 those
 who
 have
achieved
 ROSC
 and
 who
 fulﬁl
 criteria
 for
 death
 using
 neurological
criteria.500 In
 those
 comatose
 patients
 in
 whom
 a
 decision
 is
 made
to
 withdraw
 life-sustaining
 therapy,
 organ
 donation
 should
 be
 con-
sidered
 after
 circulatory
 death
 occurs.
 Organ

considered
 in
 individuals
 where
 CPR
 is
 not
 successful
 in
 achieving
ROSC.
 All
 decisions
 concerning
 organ
 donation
 must
 follow
 local
legal
 and
 ethical
 requirements,
 as
 these
 vary
 in
 different
 settings.
Screening
 for
 inherited
 disorders
Many
 sudden
 death
 victims
 have
 silent
 structural
 heart
 disease,
most
 often
 coronary
 artery
 disease,
 but
 also
 primary
 arrhythmia
syndromes,
 cardiomyopathies,
 familial
 hypercholesterolaemia
 and
premature
 ischaemic
 heart
 disease.
 Screening
 for
 inherited
 dis-
orders
 is
 crucial
 for
 primary
 prevention
 in
 relatives
 as
 it
 may
enable
 preventive
 antiarrhythmic
 treatment
 and
 medical
 follow-
up.154,155,501
Cardiac

 centres
There
 is
 wide
 variability
 in
 survival
 among
 hospitals
 caring
 for
patients
 after
 resuscitation
 from
 cardiac
 arrest.261,371,502–506 Many
studies
 have
 reported
 an
 association
 between
 survival
 to
 hospi-
tal
 discharge
 and
 transport
 to
 a
 cardiac
 arrest
 centre
 but
 there
 is
inconsistency
 in
 the
 hospital
 factors
 that
 are
 most
 related
 to
 patient
outcome.368,371,504,507,508 There
 is
 also
 inconsistency
 in
 the
 services
that
 together
 deﬁne
 a
 cardiac
 arrest
 centre.
 Most
 experts
 agree
 that
such
 a
 centre
 must
 have
 a
 cardiac

 laboratory
 that
is
 immediately
 accessible
 24/7
 and
 the

Paediatric
 basic
 life
 support
From
 the
 ILCOR
 CoSTR
 statement
 on
 the
 sequence
 for
 manoeu-
vres
 in
 BLS,
 there
 was
 found
 to
 be
 equipoise
 between
 the
 CAB
sequence
 (compression
 for
 circulation,
 airway
 and
 breathing)
and
 the
 ABC
 sequence
 (airway,
 breathing
 and
 compression
 for
circulation).509–511 Given
 that
 the
 ABC
 sequence
 has
 become
 an
established
 and
 well
 recognised
 method
 for
 the
 delivery
 of
 CPR
 to
children
 in
 Europe,
 the
 ERC
 PLS
 Writing
 Group
 determined
 that
the
 use
 of
 this
 sequence
 should
 continue,
 particularly
 as
 the
 pre-
vious
 guidelines
 have
 led
 to
 its
 instruction
 to
 many
 hundreds
 of
thousands
 of
 healthcare
 providers
 and
 lay
 people.
Sequence
 of
 actions
 in
 basic
 life
 support
Rescuers
 who
 have
 been
 taught
 adult
 BLS
 or
 the
 chest
compression-only
 sequence
 and
 have
 no
 speciﬁc
 knowledge
 of
 pae-
diatric
 resuscitation
 may
 use
 this,
 as
 the
 outcome
 is
 worse
 if
 they
do
 nothing.
 However,
 it
 is
 better
 to
 provide
 rescue
 breaths
 as
 part
 of
the
 resuscitation
 sequence
 when
 applied
 to
 children
 as
 the
 asphyx-
ial
 nature
 of
 most
 paediatric
 cardiac
 arrests
 necessitates
 ventilation
as
 part
 of
 effective
 CPR.119,120 Non-specialists
 who
 wish
 to
 learn
paediatric
 resuscitation
 because
 they
 have
 responsibility
 for
 chil-
dren
 (e.g.
 teachers,
 school
 nurses,
 lifeguards),
 should
 be
 taught
 that
it
 is
 preferable
 to
 modify
 adult
 BLS
 and
 perform
 ﬁve
 initial
 breaths
followed
 by
 1
 min
 of
 CPR
 before
 they
 go
 for
 help
 (see

Basic
 life
 support
 for
 those
 with
 a
 duty
 to
 respond
The
 following
 sequence
 is
 to
 be
 followed
 by
 those
 with
 a
 duty
to
 respond
 to
 paediatric
 emergencies
 (usually
 health
 professionals)
(Fig.
 1.17).
 Although
 the
 following
 sequence
 describes
 expired
 air
ventilation,
 health
 professionals
 with
 a
 responsibility
 for
 treating
children
 will
 usually
 have
 access
 to,
 and
 training
 in
 the
 use
 of
 bag
mask
 ventilation
 (BMV),
 and
 these
 should
 be
 used
 to
 provide
 rescue
breaths.
1.
 Ensure
 the
 safety
 of
 rescuer
 and
 child
2.
 Check
 the
 child’s
 responsiveness
• Stimulate
 the
 child
 and
 ask
 loudly:
 Are
 you
 all
 right?
3A.
 If
 the
 child
 responds
 by
 answering,
 crying
 or
 moving:
• Leave
 the
 child
 in
 the
 position
 in
 which
 you
 ﬁnd
 him
 (provided
he
 is
 not
 in
 further
 danger).
• Check
 his
 condition
 and
 call
 for
 help.
• Reassess
 him
 regularly.
3B.
 If
 the
 child
 does
 not
 respond:
• Shout
 for
 help.
• Turn
 the
 child
 carefully
 on
 his
 back.
• Open
 the
 child’s
 airway
 by
 tilting
 the
 head
 and
 lifting
 the
 chin.
◦
 Place
 your
 hand
 on
 his
 forehead
 and
 gently
 tilt
 his
 head
 back.
◦
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 with
 your
 ﬁngertip(s)
 under
 the
 point
 of

the
 chin
 as
 this
 may
 obstruct
 the
 airway.
 This
 is
 especially
important
 in
 infants.
◦ If
 you
 still
 have
 difﬁculty
 in
 opening
 the
 airway,
 try
 a
 jaw
thrust:
 place
 the
 ﬁrst
 two
 ﬁngers
 of
 each
 hand
 behind
 each
side
 of
 the
 child’s
 mandible
 and
 push
 the
 jaw
 forward.
Have
 a
 low
 threshold
 for
 suspecting
 an
 injury
 to
 the
 neck;
if
 so,
 try
 to
 open
 the
 airway
 by
 jaw
 thrust
 alone.
 If
 jaw
 thrust
alone
 does
 not
 enable
 adequate
 airway
 patency,
 add
 head
 tilt
 a
small
 amount
 at
 a
 time
 until
 the
 airway
 is
 open.
4.
 Keeping
 the
 airway
 open,
 look,
 listen
 and
 feel
 for
 normal
breathing
 by
 putting
 your
 face
 close
 to
 the
 child’s
 face
 and
looking
 along
 the
 chest:
• Look
 for
 chest
 movements
• Listen
 at
 the
 child’s
 nose
 and
 mouth
 for
 breath
 sounds
• Feel
 for
 air
 movement
 on
 your
 cheek.
In
 the
 ﬁrst
 few
 minutes
 after
 a
 cardiac
 arrest
 a
 child
 may
be
 taking
 slow
 infrequent
 gasps.
 Look,
 listen
 and
 feel
 for
 no
more
 than
 10
 s
 before
 deciding
 –
 if
 you
 have
 any
 doubt
 whether
breathing
 is
 normal,
 act
 as
 if
 it
 is
 not
 normal:
5A.
 If
 the
 child
 is
 breathing
 normally:
• Turn
 the
 child
 on
 his
 side
 into
 the
 recovery
 position
 (see
 below).
If
 there
 is
 a
 history
 of
 trauma,
 cervical
 spine
 injury
 should
 be
considered.
• Send
 or
 go
 for
 help
 –
 call
 the
 emergency
 services.
• Check
 for
 continued
 breathing.
5B.
 If
 breathing
 is
 not
 normal
 or
 absent:
• Carefully
 remove
 any
 obvious
 airway
 obstruction.
• Give
 ﬁve
 initial
 rescue
 breaths.
• While
 performing
 the
 rescue
 breaths
 note
 any
 gag
 or
 cough
response
 to
 your
 action.
 These
 responses
 or
 their
 absence
 will
form
 part
 of
 your
 assessment
 of
 ‘signs
 of
 life’,
 which
 will
 be
described
 later.
Rescue
 breaths
 for
 an
 infant
• Ensure
 a
 neutral
 position
 of
 the
 head
 as
 an
 infant’s
 head
 is
 usu-
ally
 ﬂexed
 when
 supine,
 this
 may
 require
 some
 extension
 (a
rolled
 towel/blanket
 under
 the
 upper
 part
 of
 the
 body
 may
 help
to
 maintain
 the
 position)
 and
 a
 chin
 lift.
• Take
 a
 breath
 and
 cover
 the
 mouth
 and
 nose
 of
 the
 infant
 with
your
 mouth,
 making
 sure
 you
 have
 a
 good
 seal.
 If
 the
 nose
and
 mouth
 cannot
 be
 covered
 in
 the
 older
 infant,
 the
 rescuer
may
 attempt
 to
 seal
 only
 the
 infant’s
 nose
 or
 mouth
 with
 his
mouth
 (if
 the
 nose
 is
 used,
 close
 the
 lips
 to
 prevent
 air
 escape)
(Fig.
 1.18).
• Blow
 steadily
 into
 the
 infant’s
 mouth
 and
 nose
 for
 about
 1
 s,
sufﬁcient
 to
 make
 the
 chest
 visibly
 rise.
Fig.
 1.19.
 Mouth-to-mouth

• Maintain
 head
 position
 and

 take
 your
 mouth
 away
from
 the
 victim
 and
 watch
 for
 his
 chest
 to
 fall
 as
 air
 comes
 out.
• Take
 another
 breath
 and
 repeat
 this
 sequence
 ﬁve
 times.
Rescue
 breaths
 for
 a
 child
 over
 1
 year
 of
 age
• Ensure
 head
 tilt
 and
 chin
 lift.
• Pinch
 the
 soft
 part
 of
 the
 nose
 closed
 with
 the
 index
 ﬁnger
 and
thumb
 of
 your
 hand
 on
 his
 forehead.
• Allow
 the
 mouth
 to
 open,
 but
 maintain
 chin
 lift.
• Take
 a
 breath
 and
 place
 your
 lips
 around
 the
 mouth,
 making
sure
 that
 you
 have
 a
 good
 seal
 (Fig.
 1.19).
• Blow
 steadily
 into
 the
 mouth
 for
 about
 1
 s,
 watching
 for
 chest
rise.
• Maintain
 head
 tilt
 and
 chin
 lift,
 take
 your
 mouth
 away
 from
 the
victim
 and
 watch
 for
 his
 chest
 to
 fall
 as
 air
 comes
 out.
• Take
 another
 breath
 and
 repeat
 this
 sequence
 ﬁve
 times.
 Iden-
tify
 effectiveness
 by
 seeing
 that
 the
 child’s
 chest
 has
 risen
 and
fallen
 in
 a
 similar
 fashion
 to
 the
 movement
 produced
 by
 a
 nor-
mal
 breath.
For
 both
 infants
 and
 children,
 if
 you
 have
 difﬁculty
 achieving
an
 effective
 breath,
 the
 airway
 may
 be
 obstructed:
• Open
 the
 child’s
 mouth
 and
 remove
 any
 visible
 obstruction.
 Do
not
 perform
 a
 blind
 ﬁnger
 sweep.
• Reposition
 the
 head.
 Ensure
 that
 there
 is
 adequate
 head
 tilt
 and
chin
 lift
 but
 also
 that
 the
 neck
 is
 not
 over-extended.
• If
 head
 tilt
 and
 chin
 lift
 has
 not
 opened
 the
 airway,
 try
 the
 jaw
thrust
 method.
• Make
 up
 to
 ﬁve
 attempts
 to
 achieve
 effective
 breaths,
 if
 still
unsuccessful,
 move
 on
 to
 chest
 compressions.
6.
 Assess
 the
 child’s
 circulation
Take
 no
 more
 than
 10
 s
 to:
Look
 for
 signs
 of
 life
 –
 this
 includes
 any
 movement,
 coughing
or
 normal
 breathing
 (gasps
 or
 infrequent,
 irregular
 breaths
 are
abnormal).
 If
 you
 check
 the
 pulse,
 ensure
 that
 you
 take
 no
 more
than
 10
 s.
 Pulse
 check
 is
 unreliable
 and
 therefore
 the
 complete
picture
 of
 how
 the
 patient
 appears
 must
 guide
 whether
 BLS
 is
required,
 i.e.
 if
 there
 are
 no
 signs
 of
 life,
 start
 BLS.40,41
7A.
 If
 you
 are
 conﬁdent
 that
 you
 can
 detect
 signs
 of
 life
within
 10
 s
• Continue
 rescue
 breathing,
 if
 necessary,
 until
 the
 child
 starts
breathing
 effectively
 on
 his
 own
• Turn
 the
 child
 on
 his
 side
 (into
 the
 recovery
 position,
 with
 cau-
tion
 if
 there
 is
 a
 history
 of
 trauma)
 if
 he
 remains
 unconscious.
• Re-assess
 the
 child
 frequently.
7B.
 If
 there
 are
 no
 signs

• Start
 chest

 rate
100–120
 min−1. After

 compressions,
 tilt
 the
 head,

and
 give
 two

 breaths.
 Continue
 compressions
 and
 breaths
in
 a
 ratio
 of
 15:2.
Chest
 compression
 in

The
 lone
 rescuer
 compresses
 the
sternum
 with
 the
 tips
 of
 two
 ﬁngers
 (Fig.
 1.20).
 If
 there
 are
 two
 or
more
 rescuers,
 use
 the
 encircling
 technique.
 Place
 both
 thumbs
 ﬂat
side
 by
 side
 on
 the
 lower
 half
 of
 the
 sternum
 (as
 above)
 with
 the
 tips
pointing
 towards
 the
 infant’s
 head.
 Spread
 both
 hands
 with
 the
 ﬁn-
gers
 together
 to
 encircle
 the
 lower
 part
 of
 the
 infant’s
 rib
 cage.
 The
ﬁngers
 should
 support
 the
 infant’s
 back.
 For
 both
 methods,
 depress
the
 lower
 sternum
 by
 at
 least
 one
 third
 the
 anterior-posterior
dimension
 of
 the
 infant’s
 chest
 or
 by
 4
 cm.512
Chest

To

 locate

 by
 ﬁnding
the
 angle
 where
 the
 lowest
 ribs
 join
 in
 the
 middle.
 Place
 the
 heel
of
 one
 hand
 on
 the
 sternum
 one
 ﬁnger’s
 breadth
 above
 this.
 Lift
the
 ﬁngers
 to
 ensure
 that
 pressure
 is
 not
 applied
 onto
 the
 child’s
ribs.
 Position
 yourself
 above
 the
 victim’s
 chest
 and,
 with
 your
 arm
straight,
 compress
 the
 sternum
 to
 at
 least
 one
 third
 of
 the
 anterior-
posterior
 dimension
 of
 the
 chest
 or
 by
 5
 cm
 (Fig.
 1.21).512,513 In
larger
 children
 or
 for
 small
 rescuers,
 this
 is
 achieved
 most
 easily
 by
using
 both
 hands,
 with
 the
 rescuer’s
 ﬁngers
 interlocked
 (Fig.
 1.22).
8.
 Do
 not
 interrupt
 resuscitation
 until:
• The
 child
 shows
 signs
 of
 life
 (starts
 to
 wake
 up,
 to
 move,
 opens
eyes
 and
 to
 breathe
 normally).
• More
 healthcare
 workers
 arrive
 and
 can
 either
 assist
 or
 take
 over.
• You
 become
 exhausted.
When
 to
 call
 for
 assistance
It
 is
 vital
 for
 rescuers
 to
 get
 help
 as
 quickly
 as
 possible
 when
 a
child
 collapses.
• When
 more
 than
 one
 rescuer
 is
 available,
 one
 starts
 resuscitation
while
 another
 rescuer
 goes
 for
 assistance.
Fig.
 1.21.
 Chest
 compression

• If
 only
 one
 rescuer
 is
 present,
 undertake
 resuscitation
 for
 about
1
 min
 or
 5
 cycles
 of
 CPR
 before
 going
 for
 assistance.
 To
 minimise
interruption
 in
 CPR,
 it
 may
 be
 possible
 to
 carry
 an
 infant
 or
 small
child
 whilst
 summoning
 help.
• If you
 are
 on
 your
 own,
 witness
 a
 child
 suddenly
 collapse
 and
 you
suspect
 a
 primary
 cardiac
 arrest,
 call
 for
 help
 ﬁrst
 and
 then
 start
CPR
 as
 the
 child
 will
 likely
 need
 urgent
 deﬁbrillation.
 This
 is
 an
uncommon
 situation.

Recovery
 position
An
 unconscious
 child
 whose
 airway
 is
 clear,
 and
 who
 is
 breath-
ing
 normally,
 should
 be
 turned
 on
 his
 side
 into
 the
 recovery
position.
 There
 are
 several
 recovery
 positions;
 they
 all
 aim
 to
 pre-
vent
 airway
 obstruction
 and
 reduce
 the
 likelihood
 of
 ﬂuids
 such
 as
saliva,
 secretions
 or
 vomit
 from
 entering
 into
 the
 upper
 airway.
Foreign

 (FBAO)
Suspect
 FBAO
 if
 the
 onset
 was
 very
 sudden
 and
 there
 are
 no
other
 signs
 of
 illness;
 there
 may
 be
 clues
 to
 alert
 the
 rescuer,
 e.g.
a
 history
 of
 eating
 or
 playing
 with
 small
 items
 immediately
 before
the
 onset
 of
 symptoms
 (Table
 1.1)
Back
 blows,
 chest
 thrusts
 and
 abdominal
 thrusts
 all
 increase
intra-thoracic
 pressure
 and
 can
 expel
 foreign
 bodies
 from
 the
 air-
way.
 If
 one
 is
 unsuccessful,
 try
 the
 others
 in
 rotation
 until
 the
 object
is
 cleared
 (Fig.
 1.23).
The
 most
 signiﬁcant
 difference
 from
 the
 adult
 algorithm
 is
 that
abdominal
 thrusts
 should
 not
 be
 used
 for
 infants.
 Although
 abdom-
inal
 thrusts
 have
 caused
 injuries
 in
 all
 age
 groups,
 the
 risk
 is
particularly
 high
 in
 infants
 and
 very
 young
 children.
 For
 this
 rea-
son,
 the
 guidelines
 for
 the
 treatment
 of
 FBAO
 are
 different
 between
infants
 and
 children.
Recognition

Active
 interventions
 to

 are
 required
 only
 when

 assistance.
 The
 principle
 of
 do
 no
 harm
should
 be
 applied,
 i.e.
 if
 the
 child
 is
 able
 to
 breathe
 and
 cough,
 even
with
 difﬁculty,
 encourage
 these
 spontaneous
 efforts.
 Do
 not
 inter-
vene
 at
 this
 point
 as
 this
 may
 move
 the
 foreign
 body
 and
 worsen
the
 problem,
 e.g.
 by
 causing
 full
 airway
 obstruction.
• If
 the
 child
 is
 coughing
 effectively,
 no
 manoeuvre
 is
 necessary.
Encourage
 the
 child
 to
 cough
 and
 continue
 monitoring
 the
 child’s
condition.
• If
 the
 child’s
 coughing
 is
 (or
 is
 becoming)
 ineffective,
 shout
 for
help
 immediately
 and
 determine
 the
 child’s
 conscious
 level.

 FBAO.
• If
 the
 child
 is
 still
 conscious
 but
 has

• If back
 blows
 do
 not
 relieve
 the
 FBAO,
 give
 chest
 thrusts
 to
 infants
or
 abdominal
 thrusts
 to
 children.
 These
 manoeuvres
 create
 an
artiﬁcial
 cough,
 increasing
 intrathoracic
 pressure
 and
 dislodging
the
 foreign
 body.
If
 back

 fail
 to
 dislodge
 the

 and
 the

 use
 chest
 thrusts
 for
 infants
 or
 abdominal

 Do

Airway
 opening.
 
Open
 the
 mouth
 and
 look
 for
 any
 obvious
object.
 If
 one
 is
 seen,
 make
 an
 attempt
 to
 remove
 it
 with
 a
 sin-
gle
 ﬁnger
 sweep.
 Do
 not
 attempt
 blind
 or
 repeated
 ﬁnger
 sweeps
–
 these
 could
 push
 the
 object
 deeper
 into
 the
 pharynx
 and
 cause
injury.
Rescue
 breaths.
 
Open
 the
 airway
 using
 a
 head
 tilt/chin
 lift
 and
attempt
 ﬁve
 rescue
 breaths.
 Assess
 the
 effectiveness
 of
 each
 breath:
if
 a
 breath
 does
 not
 make
 the
 chest
 rise,
 reposition
 the
 head
 before
making
 the
 next
 attempt.
Chest
 compressions
 and
 CPR.
• Attempt
 ﬁve
 rescue
 breaths
 and
 if
 there
 is
 no
 response
 (moving,
coughing,
 spontaneous
 breaths)
 proceed
 to
 chest
 compressions
without
 further
 assessment
 of
 the
 circulation.
• Follow
 the
 sequence
 for

 CPR
 for
 approximately
 a
minute
 or
 5
 cycles
 of
 15
 compressions
 to
 2
 ventilations
 before
summoning
 the
 EMS
 (if
 this
 has
 not
 already
 been
 done
 by
 some-
one
 else).
• When
 the
 airway
 is
 opened
 for
 attempted
 delivery
 of
 res-
cue
 breath,
 check
 if
 the
 foreign
 body
 can
 be
 seen
 in
 the
mouth.
• If
 an
 object
 is
 seen
 and
 can
 be
 reached,
 attempt
 to
 remove
 it
 with
a
 single
 ﬁnger
 sweep.
• If
 it
 appears
 the
 obstruction
 has
 been
 relieved,
 open
 and
 check
the
 airway
 as
 above;
 deliver
 rescue
 breaths
 if
 the
 child
 is
 not
breathing.
• If
 the
 child
 regains
 consciousness
 and
 exhibits
 spontaneous
 effec-
tive
 breathing,
 place
 him
 in
 a
 safe
 position
 on
 his

Assessment
 of
 the
 seriously
 ill
 or
 injured
 child
 –
 the
 prevention
 of
cardiopulmonary
 arrest
In
 children,
 secondary
 cardiopulmonary
 arrests,
 caused
 by
either
 respiratory
 or
 circulatory
 failure,
 are
 more
 frequent
 than
 pri-
mary
 arrests
 caused
 by
 arrhythmias.147,515–524 So-called
 asphyxial
arrests
 or
 respiratory
 arrests
 are
 also
 more
 common
 in
 young
 adult-
hood
 (e.g.
 trauma,
 drowning
 and
 poisoning).119,525
As
 the
 outcome
 from
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest
 in
 children
 is
 poor,
identifying
 the
 preceding
 stages
 of
 circulatory
 or
 respiratory
 failure
is
 a
 priority
 as
 effective
 early
 intervention
 in
 these
 stages
 may
 be
lifesaving.
The
 order
 of
 assessment
 and
 intervention
 for
 any
 seriously
 ill
child
 follows
 the
 ABCDE
 principles.
• A
 indicates
 airway.
• B
 indicates
 breathing.
• C
 indicates
 circulation.
• D
 indicates
 disability.
• E
 indicates
 exposure.
The
 topics
 of
 D
 and
 E
 are
 beyond
 the
 remit
 of
 these
 guidelines
but
 are
 taught
 in
 paediatric
 life
 support
 courses.
Summoning
 a
 paediatric
 rapid
 response
 team
 or
 medical
 emer-
gency
 team
 may
 reduce
 the
 risk
 of
 respiratory
 and/or
 cardiac
 arrest
in
 hospitalised
 children
 outside
 the
 intensive
 care
 setting
 but
 the
evidence
 is
 limited
 on
 this
 point
 as
 the
 literature
 tends
 not
 to
separate
 out
 the
 team
 response
 alone
 from
 the
 other
 systems
 in
place
 to
 identify
 early
 deterioration.526–529 Processes
 to
 detect
 the
early
 deterioration
 are
 key
 in
 reducing
 the
 morbidity
 and
 mortal-
ity
 of
 seriously
 ill
 and
 injured
 children.
 Speciﬁc
 scores
 can
 be
 used
(e.g.
 the
 paediatric
 early
 warning
 score,
 PEWS),530 but
 there
 is
 no
evidence
 that
 these
 improve
 the
 decision
 making
 process,
 or
 the
clinical
 outcome.512,531
Diagnosing
 respiratory
 failure:
 assessment
 of
 A
 and
 B.
 The
 assess-
ment
 of
 a
 potentially
 critically
 ill
 child
 starts
 with
 the
 assessment
of
 airway
 (A)
 and
 breathing
 (B).
 The
 signs
 of
 respiratory
 failure
 may
include:
• Respiratory
 rate
 outside
 the
 normal
 range
 for
 the
 child’s
 age
 –
either
 too
 fast
 or
 too
 slow.532
• Initially
 increased
 work
 of
 breathing,  which
 may
 progress
 to
inadequate/decreased
 work
 of
 breathing
 as
 the
 child
 tires
 or
 com-
pensatory
 mechanisms
 fail.
• Additional
 noises
 such
 as
 stridor,
 wheeze,
 crackles,
 grunting,
 or
the
 loss
 of
 breath
 sounds.
• Decreased
 tidal
 volume
 marked
 by
 shallow
 breathing,
 decreased
chest
 expansion
 or
 decreased
 air
 entry
 at
 auscultation.
• Hypoxaemia
 (without/with
 supplemental
 oxygen)
 generally
identiﬁed
 by
 cyanosis
 but
 it
 is
 often
 detectable
 prior
 to
 this
 by
pulse
 oximetry.
There
 may
 be
 associated
 signs
 in
 other
 organ
 systems.
 Even
though
 the
 primary
 problem
 is
 respiratory,
 other
 organ
 systems
will
 be
 involved
 to
 try
 to
 ameliorate
 the
 overall
 physiological
 dis-
turbance.
These
 are
 detectable
 in
 step
 C
 of
 the
 assessment
 and
 include:
• Increasing
 tachycardia
 (compensatory
 mechanism
 to
 increase
tissue
 oxygen
 delivery).
• Pallor.
• Bradycardia
 (an
 ominous
 indicator
 of
 the
 loss
 of
 compensatory
mechanisms).
• Alteration
 in
 the
 level
 of
 consciousness
 (a
 sign
 that
 compensatory
mechanisms
 are
 failing)
 owing
 to
 poor
 perfusion
 of
 the
 brain.
Diagnosing
 circulatory
 failure:
 assessment
 of
 C.
 Circulatory
 failure
is
 characterised
 by
 a
 mismatch
 between
 the
 metabolic
 demand
by
 the
 tissues,
 and
 the
 delivery
 of
 oxygen
 and
 nutrients
 by
 the
circulation.532,533 Signs
 of
 circulatory
 failure
 might
 include:
• Increased
 heart
 rate
 (bradycardia
 is
 an
 ominous
 sign
 of
 physio-
logical
 decompensation).532
• Decreased
 systemic
 blood
 pressure.
• Decreased
 peripheral
 perfusion
 (prolonged
 capillary
 reﬁll
 time,
decreased
 skin
 temperature,
 pale
 or
 mottled
 skin)
 –
 signs
 of
increased
 vascular
 resistance.
• Bounding
 pulses,
 vasodilation
 with
 widespread
 erythema
 may
 be
seen
 in
 conditions
 with
 decreased
 vascular
 resistance.
• Weak
 or
 absent
 peripheral
 pulses.
• Decreased
 intravascular
 volume.
• Decreased
 urine
 output.
The
 transition
 from
 a
 compensatory
 state
 to
 decompensation
may
 occur
 in
 an
 unpredictable
 way.
 Therefore,
 the
 child
 should

Diagnosing
 cardiopulmonary

Signs
 of
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest
 include:
• Unresponsiveness
 to
 pain
 (coma)
• Apnoea
 or
 gasping
 respiratory
 pattern
• Absent
 circulation
• Pallor
 or
 deep
 cyanosis
Palpation
 of
 a
 pulse
 is
 not
 reliable
 as
 the
 sole
 determinant
 of
 the
need
 for
 chest
 compressions.40,169,534,535 In
 the
 absence
 of
 signs
 of
life,
 rescuers
 (lay
 and
 professional)
 should
 begin
 CPR
 unless
 they
are
 certain
 that
 they
 can
 feel
 a
 central
 pulse
 within
 10
 seconds
(infants
 –
 brachial
 or
 femoral
 artery;
 children
 –
 carotid
 or
 femoral
artery).
 If
 there
 is
 any
 doubt,
 start
 CPR.42,169,170,536 If

skilled
 in

 start
 with
 100%
 oxygen.
• Establish
 respiratory
 monitoring
 (ﬁrst

 –
 SpO2).
• Achieving
 adequate
 ventilation
 and
 oxygenation
 –
 this
 may
require
 the
 use
 of
 airway
 adjuncts
 +/− bag-mask
 ventilation
(BMV),
 the
 use
 of
 a
 laryngeal
 mask
 airway
 or
 other
 supraglottic
airway,
 securing
 a
 deﬁnitive
 airway
 by
 tracheal
 intubation
 and
positive
 pressure
 ventilation.
• For
 intubated
 children,
 it
 is
 standard
 practice
 that
 their
 end
tidal
 carbon
 dioxide
 levels
 are
 monitored.
 End
 tidal
 carbon
 diox-
ide
 monitoring
 can
 also
 be
 used
 in
 non-intubated
 critically
 ill
patients.
• Very
 rarely,
 a
 surgical
 airway
 may
 be
 required.
Circulation.
• Establish
 cardiac
 monitoring
 (ﬁrst
 line
 –
 pulse
 oximetry/SpO2,
electrocardiography
 (ECG)
 and
 non-invasive
 blood
 pressure
(NIBP)).
• Secure
 intravascular
 access.
 This
 may
 be
 achieved
 by
 peripheral
intravenous
 (IV)
 or
 by
 intraosseous
 (IO)
 route.
 If
 already
 in
 situ,
 a
central
 intravenous
 catheter
 should
 be
 used.
• Give
 a
 ﬂuid
 bolus
 (20
 ml
 kg−1)
 and/or
 drugs
 (e.g.,
 inotropes,
 vaso-
pressors,
 anti-arrhythmics)
 to
 treat
 circulatory
 failure
 due
 to
hypovolaemia,
 e.g.
 from
 ﬂuid
 loss
 or
 maldistribution,
 as
 seen
 in
septic
 shock
 and
 anaphylaxis.
• Consider
 carefully
 the
 use
 of
 ﬂuid
 bolus
 in
 primary
 cardiac
 func-
tioning
 disorders,
 e.g.
 myocarditis,
 cardiomyopathy.
• Do
 not
 give
 a
 ﬂuid
 bolus
 in
 severe
 febrile
 illness
 when
 circulatory
failure
 is
 absent.512,537–539
• Isotonic
 crystalloids
 are
 recommended
 as
 initial
 resuscitation
ﬂuid
 in
 infants
 and
 children
 with
 any
 type
 of
 shock,
 including
septic
 shock.512,540–545
• Assess
 and
 re-assess
 the
 child
 repeatedly,
 beginning
 each
 time
with
 the
 airway
 before
 proceeding
 to
 breathing
 and
 then
 the
circulation.
 Blood
 gas
 and
 lactate
 measurement
 may
 be
 helpful.
• During
 treatment,
 capnography,
 invasive
 monitoring
 of
 arterial
blood
 pressure,
 blood

 remains
 the

 for

 and

 in

the
 SADs
 represent
 a
 range
 of
 acceptable
 airway
 devices
 that
 may
assist

Tracheal
 intubation.
 
Tracheal
 intubation
 is
 the
 most
 secure
and
 effective
 way
 to
 establish
 and
 maintain
 the
 airway.
 The
 oral
route
 for
 tracheal
 intubation
 is
 preferable
 during
 resuscitation.
 In
the
 conscious
 child,
 the
 judicious
 use
 of
 anaesthetics,
 sedatives
and
 neuromuscular
 blocking
 drugs
 is
 essential
 to
 avoid
 multiple
intubation
 attempts
 or
 intubation
 failure.548,549 Only
 skilled
 and
experienced
 practitioners
 should
 perform
 intubation.
Clinical
 examination
 and
 capnography
 should
 be
 used
 to
 ensure
that
 the
 tracheal
 tube
 remains
 secured
 and
 vital
 signs
 should
 be
monitored.550
Intubation
 during
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest.
 
The
 child
 who
 is
 in
cardiopulmonary
 arrest
 does
 not
 require
 sedation
 or
 analgesia
 to
 be
intubated.
 Appropriate
 tracheal
 tube
 sizes
 are
 shown
 in
 Table

A
 correctly
 sized
 cuffed
 tracheal
 tube
 is
 as
 safe
 as
 an
uncuffed

 (not
 for

 provided
attention
 
is
 
paid
 
to
 
its
 
placement,
 
size
 
and
 
cuff
 
inﬂation

 excessive
 cuff
 pressure
 may
 lead
 to

Displaced,

and
 are
 associated
 with

 if
 there
 is
 any
 doubt
 as
 to
 the
 tube
 position,
 conﬁrm
 the
 place-
ment
 of
 the
 tracheal
 tube
 by
 direct
 laryngoscopy.
 After
 correct
placement
 and
 conﬁrmation,
 secure
 the
 tracheal
 tube
 and
 reassess
its
 position.
 Maintain
 the
 child’s
 head
 in
 the
 neutral
 position
 as
 ﬂex-
ion
 of
 the
 head
 will
 drive
 the
 tube
 further
 into
 the
 trachea
 whereas
extension
 may
 pull
 it
 out
 of
 the
 airway.556
Breathing.
Oxygenation.
 
Give
 oxygen
 at
 the
 highest
 concentration
 (i.e.
100%)
 during
 initial
 resuscitation.
Once
 the
 child
 is
 stabilised
 and/or
 there
 is
 ROSC,
 titrate
 the
 frac-
tion
 of
 inspired
 oxygen
 (FiO2) to
 achieve
 normoxaemia,
 or
 at
 least
(if
 arterial
 blood
 gas
 is
 not
 available),
 maintain
 SpO2 in
 the
 range
of
 94–98%.557,558

Ventilation.
 
Healthcare
 providers
 commonly
 provide
 exces-
sive
 ventilation
 during
 CPR
 and
 this
 may
 be
 harmful.
 A
 simple
guide
 to
 deliver
 an
 appropriate
 tidal
 volume
 is
 to
 achieve
 nor-
mal  chest
 wall
 rise.
 Use
 a
 ratio
 of
 15
 chest
 compressions
 to
 2
ventilations
 and
 a
 compression
 rate
 of
 100–120
 min−1. Once
 the
airway
 is
 protected
 by
 tracheal
 intubation,
 continue
 positive
 pres-
sure
 ventilation
 at
 10
 breaths
 min−1 without
 interrupting
 the
 chest
compressions.
 Take
 care
 to
 ensure
 that
 lung
 inﬂation
 is
 adequate
during
 chest
 compressions.
 Once
 ROSC
 has
 been
 achieved,
 provide
normal
 ventilation
 (rate/volume)
 based
 on
 the
 child’s
 age,
 and
 by
monitoring
 end-tidal
 CO2 and
 blood
 gas
 values,
 to
 achieve
 a
 nor-
mal
 arterial
 carbon
 dioxide
 tension
 (PaCO2)
 and
 arterial
 oxygen
levels.
 Both
 hypocarbia
 and
 hypercarbia
 are
 associated
 with
 poor
outcomes
 following
 cardiac
 arrest.559 This
 means
 that
 the
 child
with
 ROSC
 should
 usually
 be
 ventilated
 at
 12–24
 breaths
 min−1,
according
 to
 their
 age
 normal
 values.
Bag
 mask
 ventilation.
 
Bag
 mask
 ventilation
 (BMV)
 is
 effec-
tive
 and
 safe
 for
 a
 child
 requiring
 assisted
 ventilation
 for
 a
 short
period.560,561 Assess
 the
 effectiveness
 of
 BMV
 by
 observing
 ade-
quate
 chest
 rise,
 monitoring
 heart
 rate
 and
 auscultating
 for
 breath
sounds,
 and
 measuring
 SpO2. Any
 healthcare
 provider
 with
 a
responsibility
 for
 treating
 children
 must
 be
 able
 to
 deliver
 BMV
effectively.
Monitoring
 of
 breathing
 and
 ventilation.
End-tidal
 CO2. 
Monitoring
 end-tidal
 CO2 (EtCO2)
 with
 a
 colori-
metric
 detector
 or
 capnometer
 conﬁrms
 tracheal
 tube
 placement
in
 the
 child
 weighing
 more
 than
 2
 kg,
 and
 may
 be
 used
 in
 pre-
and
 in-hospital
 settings,
 as
 well
 as
 during
 any
 transportation
 of
a
 child.562–565 A
 colour
 change
 or
 the
 presence
 of
 a
 capnographic
waveform
 for
 more
 than
 four
 ventilated
 breaths
 indicates
 that
 the
tube
 is
 in
 the
 tracheobronchial
 tree
 both
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 a
 per-
fusing
 rhythm
 and
 during
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest.
 The
 absence
 of
exhaled
 CO2 during
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest
 does
 not
 guarantee
tube
 misplacement
 since
 a
 low
 or
 absent
 EtCO2 may
 reﬂect
 low
 or
absent
 pulmonary
 blood
 ﬂow.200,566–568 Although
 an
 EtCO2 higher
than
 2
 kPa
 (15
 mmHg)
 may
 be
 an
 indicator
 of
 adequate
 resuscita-
tion,
 current
 evidence
 does
 not
 support
 the
 use
 of
 a
 threshold
 EtCO2
value
 as
 an
 indicator
 for
 the
 quality
 of
 CPR
 or
 for
 the
 discontinuation
of
 resuscitation.512
Peripheral
 pulse
 oximetry.
 
Clinical
 evaluation
 to
 determine
the
 degree
 of
 oxygenation
 in
 a
 child
 is
 unreliable;
 therefore,
monitor
 the
 child’s
 peripheral
 oxygen
 saturation
 continuously
 by
pulse
 oximetry.
 Pulse
 oximetry
 can
 be
 unreliable
 under
 certain
 con-
ditions,
 e.g.
 if
 the
 child
 is
 in
 circulatory
 failure,
 in
 cardiopulmonary
arrest
 or
 has
 poor
 peripheral
 perfusion.
Circulation.
Vascular
 access.
 
Vascular
 access
 is
 essential
 to
 enable
 drugs
 and
ﬂuids
 to
 be
 given,
 and
 blood
 samples
 obtained.
 Venous
 access
 can
be
 difﬁcult
 to
 establish
 during
 resuscitation
 of
 an
 infant
 or
 child.
In
 critically
 ill
 children,
 if
 attempts
 at
 establishing
 intravenous
 (IV)
access
 are
 unsuccessful
 after
 one
 minute,
 insert
 an
 intra-osseous
(IO)
 needle.208,569
Intraosseous
 access.
 
Intraosseous
 (IO)
 access
 is
 a
 rapid,
 safe,
and
 effective
 route
 to
 give
 drugs,
 ﬂuids
 and
 blood
 products.570,571
The
 onset
 of
 action
 and
 time
 to
 achieve
 adequate
 plasma
 drug
concentrations
 are
 similar
 to
 that
 achieved
 via
 the
 central
 venous
route.212,572–574 Bone
 marrow
 samples
 can
 be
 used
 to
 cross
 match
for
 blood
 type
 or
 group
 for
 chemical
 analysis575–577 and
 for
 blood
gas
 measurement
 (the
 values
 may
 be
 comparable
 to
 central
 venous
blood
 gases
 if
 no
 drug
 has
 been
 injected
 in
 the
 cavity).212 Inject
large
 boluses
 of
 ﬂuid
 using
 manual
 pressure
 or
 a
 pressure
 bag.578
Maintain
 IO
 access
 until
 deﬁnitive
 IV
 access
 has
 been
 established.
Intravenous
 access
 and
 other
 routes.
 
Central
 venous
 lines
provide
 more
 secure
 long-term
 access
 but,
 compared
 with
 IO
 or
peripheral
 IV
 access,
 offer
 no
 advantages
 during
 resuscitation.209
The
 tracheal
 route
 for
 the
 administration
 of
 drugs
 is
 no
 longer
recommended.579
Fluids
 and
 drugs.
 Isotonic
 crystalloids
 are
 recommended
 as
 the
initial
 resuscitation
 ﬂuid
 for
 infants
 and
 children
 with
 any
 type
of
 circulatory
 failure.580,581 If
 there
 are
 signs
 that
 the
 systemic
perfusion
 is
 inadequate,
 give
 a
 bolus
 of
 20
 ml
 kg−1 of
 an
 isotonic
crystalloid
 even
 if
 the
 systemic
 blood
 pressure
 is
 normal.
 Follow-
ing
 each
 bolus,
 re-assess
 the
 child’s
 clinical
 state,
 using
 the
 ABCDE
system
 of
 assessment,
 to
 decide
 whether
 a
 further
 bolus
 or
 other
treatment
 is
 required.
 In
 some
 children,
 early
 inotropic
 or
 vaso-
pressor
 support
 may
 be
 needed.582,583 There
 is
 growing
 evidence
to
 prefer
 the
 use
 of
 balanced
 crystalloids
 as
 these
 induce
 less
 hyper-
chloraemic
 acidosis.584–587
In
 life-threatening
 hypovolaemic
 shock,
 as
 may
 be
 seen
 in
 rapid
blood
 loss
 in
 trauma,
 limiting
 the
 use
 of
 crystalloids
 in
 favour
 of
a
 regime
 of
 massive
 blood
 transfusion
 may
 be
 required.
 There
 are
varying
 regimes
 of
 combining
 plasma,
 platelets
 and
 other
 blood
products
 in
 delivering
 massive
 blood
 transfusion,588,589 so
 the
regime
 used
 should
 be
 according
 to
 local
 protocols.
Adrenaline.
 
Adrenaline
 (epinephrine)
 plays
 a
 central
 role
 in
the
 cardiac
 arrest
 treatment
 algorithms
 for
 non-shockable
 and
shockable
 rhythms.
 For
 cardiopulmonary
 resuscitation,
 the
 recom-
mended
 IV/IO
 dose
 of
 adrenaline
 in
 children
 for
 the
 ﬁrst
 and
 for
subsequent
 doses
 is
 10
 g
 kg−1. The
 maximum
 single
 dose
 is
 1
 mg.
If
 needed,
 give
 further
 doses
 of
 adrenaline
 every
 3–5
 min.
 The
 use
of
 single
 higher
 doses
 of
 adrenaline
 (above
 10
 g
 kg−1)
 is
 not
 rec-
ommended
 because
 it
 does
 not
 improve
 survival
 or
 neurological
outcome
 after
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest.590–594
Amiodarone
 for
 shock-resistant
 paediatric
 VF/pulseless
 VT.
 
Amio-
darone
 can
 be
 used
 to
 treat
 paediatric
 shock-resistant
 VF/pulseless
VT
 (pVT).
 It
 is
 given
 after
 the
 third
 shock
 as
 a
 5
 mg
 kg−1 bolus
 (and
can
 be
 repeated
 following
 the
 ﬁfth
 shock).
 When
 treating
 other
cardiac
 rhythm
 disturbances,
 amiodarone
 must
 be
 injected
 slowly
(over
 10–20
 min)
 with
 systemic
 blood
 pressure
 and
 ECG
 monitor-
ing
 to
 avoid
 causing
 hypotension.595 This
 side
 effect
 is
 less
 common
with
 the
 aqueous
 solution.257
Atropine.
 
Atropine
 is
 recommended
 only
 for
 bradycardia
caused
 by
 increased
 vagal
 tone
 or
 cholinergic
 drug
 toxicity.596–598
The
 commonly
 used
 dose
 is
 20
 g
 kg−1.
 In
 bradycardia
 with
 poor
perfusion
 unresponsive
 to
 ventilation
 and
 oxygenation,
 the
 ﬁrst
line
 drug
 is
 adrenaline,
 not
 atropine.
Calcium.
 
Calcium
 is
 essential
 for
 myocardial
 function,599 but
the
 routine
 use
 of
 calcium
 does
 not
 improve
 the
 outcome
 from
 car-
diopulmonary
 arrest.600,601 Calcium
 is
 indicated
 in
 the
 presence
 of
hypocalcaemia,
 calcium
 channel
 blocker
 overdose,
 hypermagne-
saemia
 and
 hyperkalaemia.602
Glucose.
 
Data
 from
 neonates,
 children
 and
 adults
 indicate
 that
both
 hyper-
 and
 hypo-glycaemia
 are
 associated
 with
 poor
 out-
come
 after
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest,603 but
 it
 is
 uncertain
 if
 this
is
 causative
 or
 merely
 an
 association.
 Check
 blood
 or
 plasma
 glu-
cose
 concentration
 and
 monitor
 closely
 in
 any
 ill
 or
 injured
 child,
including
 after
 cardiac
 arrest.
 Do
 not
 give
 glucose-containing
 ﬂuids
during
 CPR
 unless
 hypoglycaemia
 is
 present.604 Avoid
 hyper-
 and
hypoglycaemia
 following
 ROSC.605
Magnesium.
 
There
 is
 no
 evidence
 for
 giving
 magnesium
 rou-
tinely
 during
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest.606,607 Magnesium
 treatment
is
 indicated
 in
 the
 child
 with
 documented
 hypomagnesaemia
 or
with
 torsade
 de
 pointes
 VT
 (50
 mg  kg−1),
 regardless
 of
 the
 cause.608
Sodium
 bicarbonate.
 
There
 is
 no
 evidence
 for
 giving
 sodium
bicarbonate
 
routinely
 
during
 
cardiopulmonary
 
arrest.609–611
Sodium
 bicarbonate
 may
 be
 considered
 for
 the
 child
 with
prolonged
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest
 and/or
 severe
 metabolic
 acid-
osis.
 Sodium
 bicarbonate
 may
 also
 be
 considered
 in

Deﬁbrillators
Manual
 deﬁbrillators
 capable
 of
 delivering
 the
 full
 energy
requirements
 from
 neonates
 upwards
 must
 be
 available
 within
hospitals
 and
 in
 other
 healthcare
 facilities
 caring
 for
 children
 at
risk
 of
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest.
 Automated
 external
 deﬁbrillators
(AEDs)
 are
 pre-set
 for
 all
 variables
 including
 the
 energy
 dose.
Pad/paddle
 size
 for
 deﬁbrillation
Select
 the
 largest
 possible
 available
 paddles
 to
 provide
 good
contact
 with
 the
 chest
 wall.
 The
 ideal
 size
 is
 unknown
 but
 there
should
 be
 good
 separation
 between
 the
 pads.617,618 Recommended
sizes
 are
 4.5
 cm
 diameter
 for
 infants
 and
 children
 weighing
 <10
 kg,
and
 8–12
 cm
 diameter
 for
 children
 weighing
 >10
 kg
 (older
 than
 one
year).
 Self-adhesive
 pads
 facilitate
 continuous
 good
 quality
 CPR.
Position
 of
 the
 paddles
Apply
 the
 paddles
 ﬁrmly
 to
 the
 bare
 chest
 in
 the
 antero-lateral
position,
 one
 paddle
 placed
 below
 the
 right
 clavicle
 and
 the
 other
in
 the
 left
 axilla
 (Fig.
 1.24).
 If
 the
 paddles
 are
 too
 large
 and
 there
 is
a
 danger
 of
 charge
 arcing
 across
 the
 paddles,
 one
 should
 be
 placed
on
 the
 upper
 back,
 below
 the
 left
 scapula
 and
 the
 other
 on
 the
 front,
to
 the
 left
 of
 the
 sternum.
Energy
 dose
 in
 children.
 In
 Europe
 we
 continue
 to
 recommend
 a
dose
 of
 4
 J kg−1 for
 initial
 and
 subsequent
 deﬁbrillation.
 Doses
higher
 than
 4
 J
 kg−1 (as
 much
 as
 9
 J
 kg−1)
 have
 deﬁbrillated
 children
effectively
 with
 negligible
 side
 effects.619,620
If
 no
 manual
 deﬁbrillator
 is
 available,
 use
 an
 AED
 that
 can
recognise
 paediatric
 shockable
 rhythms.621–623 The
 AED
 should
be
 equipped
 with
 a
 dose
 attenuator
 that
 decreases
 the
 deliv-
ered
 energy
 to
 a
 value
 more
 suitable
 for
 children
 aged
 1–8
 years
(50–75
 J).624,625 If
 such
 an
 AED
 in
 not
 available,
 use
 a
 standard
adult
 AED
 and
 the
 pre-set
 adult
 energy
 levels.
 For
 children
 older
than
 8
 years,
 use
 a
 standard
 AED
 with
 standard
 paddles.
 Experience
with
 the
 use
 of
 AEDs
 (preferably
 with
 dose
 attenuator)
 in
 children
younger
 than
 1
 year
 is
 limited;
 their
 use
 is
 acceptable
 if
 no
 other
option
 is
 available.
Advanced
 management
 of
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest
The
 paediatric
 advanced
 life
 support
 algorithm
 is
 shown
 in
Fig.
 1.25. More
 detailed
 algorithms
 for
 the
 treatment
 of
 non-
shockable
 (Fig.
 1.26)
 and
 shockable
 rhythms
 (Fig.
 1.27) also
 shown.
Cardiac
 monitoring.
 Position
 the
 cardiac
 monitor
 leads
 or
 self-
adhesive
 pads
 as
 soon
 as
 possible
 to
 enable
 differentiation
between
 a
 shockable
 and
 a
 non-shockable
 cardiac
 rhythm.
Non-shockable
 rhythms
 are
 pulseless
 electrical
 activity
 (PEA),
bradycardia
 (<60
 min−1 with
 no
 signs
 of
 circulation)
 and
 asystole.
PEA
 and
 bradycardia
 often
 have
 wide
 QRS
 complexes.
 Shockable
rhythms
 are
 pVT
 and
 VF.
 These
 rhythms
 are
 more
 likely
 after
 sud-
den
 collapse
 in
 children
 with
 heart
 disease
 or
 in
 adolescents.
Non-shockable
 rhythms.
 Most
 cardiopulmonary
 arrests
 in
 children
and
 adolescents
 are
 of
 respiratory
 origin.626 A
 period
 of
 immediate
CPR
 is
 therefore
 mandatory
 in
 this
 age
 group
 before
 searching
 for
an
 AED
 or
 manual
 deﬁbrillator,
 as
 its
 immediate
 availability
 will
 not
improve
 the
 outcome
 of
 a
 respiratory
 arrest.
 The
 most
 common
 ECG
patterns
 in
 infants,
 children
 and
 adolescents
 with
 cardiopulmonary
arrest
 are
 asystole
 and
 PEA.
 PEA
 is
 characterised
 by
 electrical
 activ-
ity
 on
 the
 ECG,
 and
 absent
 pulses.
 It
 commonly
 follows
 a
 period
of
 hypoxia
 or
 myocardial
 ischaemia,
 but
 occasionally
 can
 have
 a
reversible
 cause
 (i.e.,
 one
 of
 the
 4
 Hs
 and
 4
 Ts)
 that
 led
 to
 a
 sudden
impairment
 of
 cardiac
 output.
Shockable
 rhythms.
 Primary
 VF
 occurs
 in
 3.8–19%
 of
 cardiopul-
monary
 arrests
 in
 children,
 the
 incidence
 of
 pVT/VF
 increases
 as
 the
age
 increases.123,340,627–634 The
 primary
 determinant
 of
 survival
from
 VT/pVT
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest
 is
 the
 time
 to
 deﬁbrillation.
Pre-hospital
 deﬁbrillation
 within
 the
 ﬁrst
 3
 min
 of
 witnessed
 adult
VF
 arrest
 results
 in
 >50%
 survival.
 However,
 the
 success
 of
 deﬁbrilla-
tion
 decreases
 dramatically
 the
 longer
 the
 time
 until
 deﬁbrillation:
for
 every
 minute
 delay
 in
 deﬁbrillation
 (without
 any
 CPR),
 survival
decreases
 by
 7–10%.
 Secondary
 VF
 is
 present
 at
 some
 point
 in
 up
to
 27%
 of
 in-hospital
 resuscitation
 events.
 It
 has
 a
 much
 poorer
prognosis
 than
 primary
 VF.635
Extracorporeal
 life
 support.
 Extracorporeal
 life
 support
 should
 be
considered
 for
 children
 with
 cardiac
 arrest
 refractory
 to
 conven-
tional
 CPR
 with
 a
 potentially
 reversible
 cause,
 if
 the
 arrest
 occurs
where
 expertise,
 resources
 and
 system
 are
 available
 to
 rapidly
 ini-
tiate
 extracorporeal
 life
 support
 (ECLS).
Arrhythmias
Unstable
 arrhythmias
Check
 for
 signs
 of
 life
 and
 the
 central
 pulse
 of
 any
 child
 with
 an
arrhythmia;
 if
 signs
 of
 life
 are
 absent,
 treat
 as
 for
 cardiopulmonary
arrest.
 If
 the
 child
 has
 signs
 of
 life
 and
 a
 central
 pulse,
 evaluate
the
 haemodynamic
 status.
 Whenever
 the
 haemodynamic
 status
 is
compromised,
 the
 ﬁrst
 steps
 are:
1.
 Open
 the
 airway
2. Give
 oxygen
 and
 assist
 ventilation
 as
 necessary
3.
 Attach
 ECG
 monitor
 or
 deﬁbrillator
 and
 assess
 the
 cardiac
rhythm
4.
 Evaluate
 if
 the
 rhythm
 is
 slow
 or
 fast
 for
 the
 child’s
 age
5.
 Evaluate
 if
 the
 rhythm
 is
 regular
 or
 irregular
6. Measure
 QRS
 complex
 (narrow
 complexes:
 <0.08
 s
 duration;
wide
 complexes:
 >0.08
 s)
7.
 The
 
treatment
 
options
 
are
 
dependent
 
on
 
the
 
child’s
haemodynamic
 stability.

Bradycardia
Bradycardia
 is
 caused
 commonly
 by
 hypoxia,
 acidosis
 and/or
severe
 hypotension;
 it
 may
 progress
 to
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest.
Give
 100%
 oxygen,
 and
 positive
 pressure
 ventilation
 if
 required,
to
 any
 child
 presenting
 with
 bradyarrhythmia
 and
 circulatory
 fail-
ure.
 If
 a
 child
 with
 decompensated
 circulatory
 failure
 has
 a
 heart
rate
 <60
 beats
 min−1, and
 they
 do
 not
 respond
 rapidly
 to
 ventilation
with
 oxygen,
 start
 chest
 compressions
 and
 give
 adrenaline.
Cardiac
 pacing
 (either
 transvenous
 or
 external)
 is
 generally
not
 useful
 during
 resuscitation.
 It
 may
 be
 considered
 in
 cases
 of
AV
 block
 or
 sinus
 node
 dysfunction
 unresponsive
 to
 oxygenation,
ventilation,
 chest
 compressions
 and
 other
 medications;
 pacing
 is
not
 effective
 in
 asystole
 or
 arrhythmias
 caused
 by
 hypoxia
 or
ischaemia.636
Tachycardia
Narrow
 complex
 tachycardia.
 If
 supraventricular
 tachycardia
 (SVT)
is
 the
 likely
 rhythm,
 vagal
 manoeuvres
 (Valsalva
 or
 diving
 reﬂex)
may
 be
 used
 in
 haemodynamically
 stable
 children.
 They
 can
 also
be
 used
 in
 haemodynamically
 unstable
 children,
 but
 only
 if
 they
 do
not
 delay
 chemical
 or
 electrical
 cardioversion.
Adenosine
 is
 usually
 effective
 in
 converting
 SVT
 into
 sinus
rhythm.
 It
 is
 given
 by
 rapid,
 intravenous
 injection
 as
 close
 as
practicable
 to
 the
 heart,
 and
 followed
 immediately
 by
 a
 bolus
 of
normal
 saline.
 If
 the
 child
 has
 signs
 of
 decompensated
 shock
 with
depressed
 conscious
 level,
 omit
 vagal
 manoeuvres
 and
 adenosine
and
 attempt
 electrical
 cardioversion
 immediately.
Electrical
 cardioversion
 (synchronised
 with
 R
 wave)
 is
 also
 indi-
cated
 when
 vascular
 access
 is
 not
 available,
 or
 when
 adenosine
 has
failed
 to
 convert
 the
 rhythm.
 The
 ﬁrst
 energy
 dose
 for
 electrical
cardioversion
 of
 SVT
 is
 1
 J kg−1 and
 the
 second
 dose
 is
 2
 J kg−1.
If
 unsuccessful,
 give
 amiodarone
 or
 procainamide
 under
 guid-
ance
 from
 a
 paediatric
 cardiologist
 or
 intensivist
 before
 the
 third
attempt.
 Verapamil
 may
 be
 considered
 as
 an
 alternative
 therapy
 in
older
 children
 but
 should
 not
 be
 routinely
 used
 in
 infants.
Wide
 complex
 tachycardia.
 In
 children,
 wide-QRS
 complex
 tachy-
cardia
 is
 uncommon
 and
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 supraventricular
 than
ventricular
 in
 origin.637 Nevertheless,
 in
 haemodynamically
 unsta-
ble
 children,
 it
 must
 be
 considered
 to
 be
 VT
 until
 proven
 otherwise.
Ventricular
 tachycardia
 occurs
 most
 often
 in
 the
 child
 with
 under-
lying
 heart
 disease
 (e.g.,
 after
 cardiac
 surgery,
 cardiomyopathy,
myocarditis,
 electrolyte
 disorders,
 prolonged
 QT
 interval,
 central
intracardiac
 catheter).
 Synchronised
 cardioversion
 is
 the
 treatment
of
 choice
 for
 unstable
 VT
 with
 signs
 of
 life.
 Consider
 anti-arrhythmic
therapy
 if
 a
 second
 cardioversion
 attempt
 is
 unsuccessful
 or
 if
 VT
recurs.
Stable
 arrhythmias
Whilst
 maintaining
 the
 child’s
 airway,
 breathing
 and
 circula-
tion,
 contact
 an
 expert
 before
 initiating
 therapy.
 Depending
 on
 the
child’s
 clinical
 history,
 presentation
 and
 ECG
 diagnosis,
 a
 child
 with
stable,
 wide-QRS
 complex
 tachycardia
 may
 be
 treated
 for
 SVT
 and
be
 given
 vagal
 manoeuvres
 or
 adenosine.
Special
 circumstances
Life
 support
 for
 blunt
 or
 penetrating
 trauma
Cardiac
 arrest
 from
 major
 (blunt
 or
 penetrating)
 trauma
 is
 asso-
ciated
 with
 a
 very
 high
 mortality.292,638–643 Consider
 the
 4Ts
 and
4Hs
 as
 potentially
 reversible
 causes.
 There
 is
 little
 evidence
 to
 sup-
port
 any
 additional
 speciﬁc
 interventions
 that
 are
 different
 from
 the
routine
 management
 of
 cardiac
 arrest;
 however,
 the
 use
 of
 resusci-
tative
 thoracotomy
 may
 be
 considered
 in
 children
 with
 penetrating
injuries.644,645
Extracorporeal
 membrane
 oxygenation
 (ECMO)
For
 infants
 and
 children
 with
 a
 cardiac
 diagnosis
 and
 an
 in-
hospital
 arrest,
 ECMO
 should
 be
 considered
 as
 a
 useful
 rescue
strategy
 if
 expertise,
 adequate
 resources
 and
 systems
 are
 equally
available.
 There
 is
 insufﬁcient
 evidence
 to
 suggest
 for
 or
 against
 the
use
 of
 ECMO
 in
 non-cardiac
 arrest
 or
 for
 children
 with
 myocarditis
or
 cardiomyopathy
 who
 are
 not
 in
 arrest.512
Pulmonary
 hypertension
There
 is
 an
 increased
 risk
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
 in
 children
 with
 pul-
monary
 hypertension.646,647 Follow
 routine
 resuscitation
 protocols
in
 these
 patients
 with
 emphasis
 on
 high
 FiO2
and
 alkalo-
sis/hyperventilation
 because
 this
 may
 be
 as
 effective
 as
 inhaled
nitric
 oxide
 in
 reducing
 pulmonary
 vascular
 resistance.648
Post
 resuscitation
 care
Post
 cardiac
 arrest
 care
 must
 be
 a
 multidisciplinary
 activity
 and
include
 all
 the
 treatments
 needed
 for
 complete
 neurological
 recov-
ery.
Myocardial
 dysfunction
Myocardial
 dysfunction
 is
 common
 after
 cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.366,649–652 Parenteral
 ﬂuids
 and
 vasoactive
 drugs
(adrenaline,
 dobutamine,
 dopamine
 and
 noradrenaline)
 may
improve
 the
 child’s
 post-arrest
 haemodynamic
 status
 and
 should
be
 titrated
 to
 maintain
 a
 systolic
 blood
 pressure
 of
 at
 least
 >5th
centile
 for
 age.512
Goals
 for
 oxygenation
 and
 ventilation
Aim
 for
 a
 normal
 PaO2 range
 (normoxaemia)
 post-ROSC
 once
 a
patient
 is
 stabilised.559,653–655 There
 is
 insufﬁcient
 paediatric
 evi-
dence
 to
 suggest
 a
 speciﬁc
 PaCO2 target,
 however,
 PaCO2 should
be
 measured
 post-ROSC
 and
 adjusted
 according
 to
 patient
 charac-
teristics
 and
 needs.397,512,559,656 It
 is
 sensible
 to
 aim
 in
 general
 for
normocapnia,
 although
 this
 decision
 might
 be
 in
 part
 inﬂuenced
 by
context
 and
 disease.
Temperature
 control
 and
 management
 post
 ROSC
Mild
 
hypothermia
 
has
 
an
 
acceptable
 
safety
 
proﬁle
 
in
adults446,450 and
 neonates.657 Recently
 the
 THAPCA
 out
 of
 hospital
study
 showed
 that
 both
 hypothermia
 (32–34 ◦C)
 and
 controlled
normothermia
 (36–37.5 ◦C)
 could
 be
 used
 in
 children.658 The
 study
did
 not
 show
 a
 signiﬁcant
 difference
 for
 the
 primary
 outcome
(neurologic
 status
 at
 one
 year)
 with
 either
 approach.
 After
 ROSC,
a
 strict
 control
 of
 the
 temperature
 must
 be
 maintained
 to
 avoid
hyperthermia
 (>37.5 ◦C)
 and
 severe
 hypothermia
 (<32 ◦C).512
Glucose
 control
Both
 hyper-
 and
 hypoglycaemia
 may
 impair
 outcome
 of
 criti-
cally
 ill
 adults
 and
 children
 and
 should
 be
 avoided,659–661 but
 tight
glucose
 control
 may
 also
 be
 harmful.662 Monitor
 blood
 glucose
 and
avoid
 hypoglycaemia
 and
 hyperglycaemia.366,663,664
Prognosis
 of
 cardiopulmonary
 arrest
Although
 several
 factors
 are
 associated
 with
 outcome
 after
cardiopulmonary
 arrest
 and
 resuscitation
 there
 are
 no
 sim-
ple
 guidelines
 to
 determine
 when
 resuscitative
 efforts
 become
futile.512,656 The
 relevant
 considerations
 in
 the
 decision
 to
 continue
the
 resuscitation
 include
 the
 duration
 of
 CPR,
 cause
 of
 arrest,
 pre-
existing
 medical
 conditions,
 age,
 site
 of
 arrest,
 whether
 the
 arrest
was
 witnessed,519,665 the
 duration
 of
 untreated
 cardiopulmonary
arrest
 (‘no
 ﬂow’
 time)
 the
 presence
 of
 a
 shockable
 rhythm
 as
 the
ﬁrst
 or
 subsequent
 rhythm,
 and
 associated
 special
 circumstances
(e.g.,
 icy
 water
 drowning666,667 exposure
 to
 toxic
 drugs).

of
 the
 EEG
 as
 a
 prognostic
 factor
 is
 still
 unclear.
 Guidance
 on
 the
termination
 of
 resuscitation
 attempts
 is
 discussed
 in
 the
 chapter
on
 ethics
 in
 resuscitation
 and
 end-of-life
 decisions.10
Parental
 presence
In
 some
 Western
 societies,
 the
 majority
 of
 parents
 want
 to
 be
present
 during
 the
 resuscitation
 of
 their
 child.
 Families
 who
 are
present
 at
 their
 child’s
 death
 show
 better
 adjustment
 and
 undergo
a
 better
 grieving
 process.668 Evidence
 about
 parental
 presence
 dur-
ing
 resuscitation
 comes
 from
 selected
 countries
 and
 can
 probably
not
 be
 generalised
 to
 all
 of
 Europe,
 where
 there
 may
 be
 different
socio-cultural
 and
 ethical
 considerations.669,670
Resuscitation
 and
 support
 of
 transition
 of
 babies
 at
 birth
The
 guidelines
 that
 follow
 do
 not
 deﬁne
 the
 only
 way
 that
 resus-
citation
 at
 birth
 should
 be
 achieved;
 they
 do,
 however,
 represent
 a
widely
 accepted
 view
 of
 how
 resuscitation
 at
 birth
 can
 be
 carried
out
 both
 safely
 and
 effectively.
Preparation
A
 minority
 of
 infants
 require
 resuscitation
 at
 birth,
 but
 a
 few
more
 have
 problems
 with
 this
 perinatal
 transition,
 which,
 if
 no
 sup-
port
 is
 given,
 might
 subsequently
 result
 in
 a
 need
 for
 resuscitation.
Of
 those
 needing
 any
 help,
 the
 overwhelming
 majority
 will
 require
only
 assisted
 lung
 aeration.
 A
 tiny
 minority
 may
 need
 a
 brief
 period
of
 chest
 compressions
 in
 addition
 to
 lung
 aeration.671–673 In
 deliv-
eries
 with
 a
 known
 increased
 risk
 of
 problems,
 specially
 trained
personnel
 should
 be
 present
 with
 at
 least
 one
 person
 experienced
in
 tracheal
 intubation.
 Each
 institution
 should
 have
 a
 protocol
 in
place
 for
 rapidly
 mobilising
 a
 team
 with
 competent
 resuscitation
skills
 for
 any
 birth.
Planned
 home
 deliveries
Recommendations
 as
 to
 who
 should
 attend
 a
 planned
 home
delivery
 vary
 from
 country
 to
 country,
 but
 the
 decision
 to
 undergo
a
 planned
 home
 delivery,
 once
 agreed
 with
 medical
 and
 midwifery
staff,
 should
 not
 compromise
 the
 standard
 of
 initial
 assessment,
stabilisation
 or
 resuscitation
 at
 birth.
 Ideally,
 two
 trained
 profes-
sionals
 should
 be
 present
 at
 all
 home
 deliveries;
 one
 of
 these
 must
be
 fully
 trained
 and
 experienced
 in
 providing
 mask
 ventilation
 and
chest
 compressions
 in
 the
 newborn.
Equipment
 and
 environment
When
 a
 birth
 takes
 place
 in
 a
 non-designated
 delivery
 area,
 the
recommended
 minimum
 set
 of
 equipment
 includes
 a
 device
 for
safe
 assisted
 lung
 aeration
 and
 subsequent
 ventilation
 of
 an
 appro-
priate
 size
 for
 the
 newborn,
 warm
 dry
 towels
 and
 blankets,
 a
 sterile
instrument
 for
 cutting
 and
 clamping
 the
 umbilical
 cord
 and
 clean
gloves
 for
 the
 attendant
 and
 assistants.
Timing
 of
 clamping
 the
 umbilical
 cord
A
 systematic
 review
 on
 delayed
 cord
 clamping
 and
 cord
 milking
in
 preterm
 infants
 found
 improved
 stability
 in
 the
 immedi-
ate
 postnatal
 period,
 including
 higher
 mean
 blood
 pressure
 and
haemoglobin
 on
 admission,
 compared
 to
 controls.674 Delaying
umbilical
 cord
 clamping
 for
 at
 least
 one
 minute
 is
 recommended
 for
newborn
 infants
 not
 requiring
 resuscitation.
 A
 similar
 delay
 should
be
 applied
 to
 preterm
 babies
 not
 requiring
 immediate
 resuscitation
after
 birth.
 Until
 more
 evidence
 is
 available,
 infants
 who
 are
 not
breathing
 or
 crying
 may
 require
 the
 umbilical
 cord
 to
 be
 clamped,
so
 that
 resuscitation
 measures
 can
 commence
 promptly.
Temperature
 control
Naked,
 wet,
 newborn
 babies
 cannot
 maintain
 their
 body
 tem-
perature
 in
 a
 room
 that
 feels
 comfortably
 warm
 for
 adults.
 The
association
 between
 hypothermia
 and
 mortality
 has
 been
 known
for
 more
 than
 a
 century,675 and
 the
 admission
 temperature
 of
newborn
 non-asphyxiated
 infants
 is
 a
 strong
 predictor
 of
 mor-
tality
 at
 all
 gestations
 and
 in
 all
 settings.676 Preterm
 infants
 are
especially
 vulnerable.
 Maintain
 the
 temperature
 of
 newly
 born
non-asphyxiated
 infants
 at
 between
 36.5 ◦C
 and
 37.5 ◦C
 after
 birth.
Whilst
 maintenance
 of
 a
 baby’s
 temperature
 is
 important,
 this
should
 be
 monitored
 in
 order
 to
 avoid
 hyperthermia
 (>38.0 ◦C).
Initial
 assessment
The
 Apgar
 score
 was
 not
 designed
 to
 be
 assembled
 and
 ascribed
in
 order
 to
 then
 identify
 babies
 in
 need
 of
 resuscitation.677,678 How-
ever,
 individual
 components
 of
 the
 score,
 namely
 respiratory
 rate,
heart
 rate
 and
 tone,
 if
 assessed
 rapidly,
 can
 identify
 babies
 need-
ing
 resuscitation.677 Repeated
 assessment
 particularly
 of
 heart
 rate
and,
 to
 a
 lesser
 extent
 breathing,
 can
 indicate
 whether
 the
 baby
 is
responding
 or
 whether
 further
 efforts
 are
 needed.
Breathing
Check
 whether
 the
 baby
 is
 breathing.
 If
 so,
 evaluate
 the
 rate,
depth
 and
 symmetry
 of
 breathing
 together
 with
 any
 evidence
 of
 an
abnormal
 breathing
 pattern
 such
 as
 gasping
 or
 grunting.
Heart
 rate
Immediately
 after
 birth
 the
 heart
 rate
 is
 assessed
 to
 evaluate
 the
condition
 of
 the
 baby
 and
 subsequently
 is
 the
 most
 sensitive
 indi-
cator
 of
 a
 successful
 response
 to
 interventions.
 Heart
 rate
 is
 initially
most
 rapidly
 and
 accurately
 assessed
 by
 listening
 to
 the
 apex
 beat
with
 a
 stethoscope679 or
 by
 using
 an
 electrocardiograph.680–682
Feeling
 the
 pulse
 in
 the
 base
 of
 the
 umbilical
 cord
 is
 often
 effective
but
 can
 be
 misleading,
 cord
 pulsation
 is
 only
 reliable
 if
 found
 to
 be
more
 than
 100
 beats
 per
 minute
 (bpm)679 and
 clinical
 assessment
may
 underestimate
 the
 heart
 rate.679,683,684 For
 babies
 requiring
resuscitation
 and/or
 continued
 respiratory
 support,
 a
 modern
 pulse
oximeter
 can
 give
 an
 accurate
 heart
 rate.681
Colour
Colour
 is
 a
 poor
 means
 of
 judging
 oxygenation,685 which
 is
 bet-
ter
 assessed
 using
 pulse
 oximetry
 if
 possible.
 A
 healthy
 baby
 is
 born
blue
 but
 starts
 to
 become
 pink
 within
 30
 s
 of
 the
 onset
 of
 effective
breathing.
 If
 a
 baby
 appears
 blue
 check
 preductal
 oxygenation
 with
a
 pulse
 oximeter.
Tone
A
 very
 ﬂoppy
 baby
 is
 likely
 to
 be
 unconscious
 and
 will
 need
ventilatory
 support.
Tactile
 stimulation
Drying
 the
 baby
 usually
 produces
 enough
 stimulation
 to
 induce
effective
 breathing.
 Avoid
 more
 vigorous
 methods
 of
 stimulation.
 If
the
 baby
 fails
 to
 establish
 spontaneous
 and
 effective
 breaths
 follow-
ing
 a
 brief
 period
 of
 stimulation,
 further
 support
 will
 be
 required.
Classiﬁcation
 according
 to
 initial
 assessment
On
 the
 basis
 of
 the
 initial
 assessment,
 the
 baby
 can
 be
 placed
into
 one
 of
 three
 groups:
1.
 Vigorous
 breathing
 or
 crying,
 good
 tone,
 heart
 rate
 higher
 than
100
 min−1

 other
 than

 and,

 if
 this
 does
 not

 rate
 adequately,
 may
rarely

Dry
 and
 wrap.
 This
 baby
 will
 then
 require
 immediate
 air-
way
 control,
 lung
 inﬂation
 and
 ventilation.
 Once
 this
 has
 been
successfully
 accomplished
 the
 baby
 may
 also
 need
 chest
 com-
pressions,
 and
 perhaps
 drugs.
Preterm
 babies
 may
 be
 breathing
 and
 showing
 signs
 of
 respi-
ratory
 distress
 in
 which
 case
 they
 should
 be
 supported
 initially
with
 CPAP.
Newborn
 life
 support
Commence
 newborn
 life
 support
 if
 initial
 assessment
 shows
 that
the
 baby
 has
 failed
 to
 establish
 adequate
 regular
 normal
 breathing,
or
 has
 a
 heart
 rate
 of
 less
 than
 100
 min−1. Opening
 the
 airway
 and
aerating
 the
 lungs
 is
 usually
 all
 that
 is
 necessary.
 Furthermore,
 more
complex
 interventions
 will
 be
 futile
 unless
 these
 two
 ﬁrst
 steps
have
 been
 successfully
 completed.
Airway
Place
 the
 baby
 on
 his
 or
 her
 back
 with
 the
 head
 in
 a
 neutral
position
 (Fig.
 1.29).
 A
 2
 cm
 thickness
 of
 the
 blanket
 or
 towel
 placed
under
 the
 baby’s
 shoulder
 may
 be
 helpful
 in
 maintaining
 proper
head
 position.
 In
 ﬂoppy
 babies
 application
 of
 jaw
 thrust
 or
 the
 use
of
 an
 appropriately
 sized
 oropharyngeal
 airway
 may
 be
 essential
 in
opening
 the
 airway.
 The
 supine
 position
 for
 airway
 management
is
 traditional
 but
 side-lying
 has
 also
 been
 used
 for
 assessment
 and
routine
 delivery
 room
 management
 of
 term
 newborns.686 There
 is
no
 need
 to
 remove
 lung
 ﬂuid
 from
 the
 oropharynx
 routinely.687
Suction
 is
 needed
 only
 if
 the
 airway
 is
 obstructed.
Meconium
Lightly
 meconium
 stained
 liquor
 is
 common
 and
 does
 in
 gen-
eral
 not
 give
 rise
 to
 much
 difﬁculty
 with
 transition.
 The
 much
 less
common
 ﬁnding
 of
 very
 thick
 meconium
 stained
 liquor
 at
 birth
 is
an
 indicator
 of
 perinatal
 distress
 and
 should
 alert
 to
 the
 potential
need
 for
 resuscitation.
 Intrapartum
 suctioning
 and
 routine
 intu-
bation
 and
 suctioning
 of
 vigorous
 infants
 born
 through
 meconium
stained
 liquor
 are
 not
 recommended.
 The
 presence
 of

 in
 a
 non-vigorous
 baby
 is
 the
 only
 indication
 for
 initially
considering
 visualising
 the
 oropharynx
 and
 suctioning
 material,
which
 might
 obstruct
 the
 airway.
 Tracheal
 intubation
 should
 not

 of

 and

should
 be
 on
 initiating

 within
 the
 ﬁrst
 minute
 of

in
 non-breathing
 or
 ineffectively
 breathing
 infants
 and
 this
 should
not
 be
 delayed.
Initial
 breaths
 and
 assisted
 ventilation
After
 initial
 steps
 at
 birth,
 if
 breathing
 efforts
 are
 absent
 or
inadequate,
 lung
 aeration
 is
 the
 priority
 and
 must
 not
 be
 delayed
(Figs.
 1.28
 and
 1.30).
 In
 term
 babies,
 respiratory
 support
 should
start
 with
 air.693 The
 primary
 measure
 of
 adequate
 initial
 lung
 inﬂa-
tion
 is
 a
 prompt
 improvement
 in
 heart
 rate.
 If
 the
 heart
 rate
 is
not
 improving
 assess
 the
 chest
 wall
 movement.
 For
 the
 ﬁrst
 ﬁve
positive
 pressure
 inﬂations
 maintain
 the
 initial
 inﬂation
 pressure
for
 2–3
 s.
 This
 will
 usually
 help
 lung
 expansion.694,695 Most
 babies
needing
 respiratory
 support
 at
 birth
 will
 respond
 with
 a
 rapid
increase
 in
 heart
 rate
 within
 30
 s
 of
 lung
 inﬂation.
 If
 the
 heart
 rate
increases
 but
 the
 baby
 is
 not
 breathing
 adequately,
 ventilate
 at
 a
rate
 of
 about
 30
 breaths
 min−1 allowing
 approximately
 one
 second
for
 each
 inﬂation,
 until
 there
 is
 adequate
 spontaneous
 breathing.
Without
 adequate
 lung
 aeration,
 chest
 compressions
 will
 be
 inef-
fective;
 therefore,
 conﬁrm
 lung
 aeration
 and
 ventilation
 before
progressing
 to
 circulatory
 support.
Some
 practitioners
 will
 ensure
 airway
 control
 by
 tracheal
 intu-
bation,
 but
 this
 requires
 training
 and
 experience.
 If
 this
 skill
 is
 not
available
 and
 the
 heart
 rate
 is
 decreasing,
 re-evaluate
 the
 airway
position
 and
 deliver
 inﬂation
 breaths
 while
 summoning
 a
 colleague
with
 intubation
 skills.
 Continue
 ventilatory
 support
 until
 the
 baby
has
 established
 normal
 regular
 breathing.

 are
 associated
with
 an
 increased

 and

 in

Tracheal

 may
 be
 considered
 at
 several
 points
 during

 resuscitation:
• When
 suctioning
 the
 lower

 to

 a
 presumed

cheal
 blockage
• When,
 after
 correction
 of

 and/or
 the

 bag-mask
 ventilation
 is
 ineffective
 or
 prolonged
• When
 chest
 compressions
 are
 performed
• Special
 circumstances
 (e.g.
 congenital
 diaphragmatic
 hernia
 or
 to
give
 tracheal
 surfactant)
The
 use
 and

 of

Tracheal

 Following

and

 a

 that

 for

 that

 more

 and
 more

Continuous

 with
 respiratory

 may
 be
 provided
by
 continuous

 (CPAP),
 rather
 than
intubation.719–721 There
 are
 few
 data
 to
 guide
 the
 appropriate
 use
of
 CPAP
 in
 term
 infants
 at
 birth
 and
 further
 clinical
 studies
 are
required.722,723
Circulatory
 support
Give
 
chest
 
compressions
 
if
 
the
 
heart
 
rate
 
is
 
less
 
than
60
 beats
 min−1 despite
 adequate
 ventilation.
 As
 ventilation
 is
 the
most
 effective
 and
 important
 intervention
 in
 newborn
 resuscita-
tion,
 and
 may
 be
 compromised
 by
 compressions,
 it
 is
 vital
 to
 ensure
that
 effective
 ventilation
 is
 occurring
 before
 commencing
 chest
compressions.
The
 most
 effective
 technique
 for
 providing
 chest
 compressions
is
 with
 two
 thumbs
 over
 the
 lower
 third
 of
 the
 sternum
 with
 the
 ﬁn-
gers
 encircling
 the
 torso
 and
 supporting
 the
 back
 (Fig.
 1.31).724 This
technique
 generates
 higher
 blood
 pressures
 and
 coronary
 artery
perfusion
 with
 less
 fatigue
 than
 the
 previously
 used
 two-ﬁnger
technique.725–728 The
 sternum
 is
 compressed
 to
 a
 depth
 of
 approx-
imately
 one-third
 of
 the
 anterior–posterior
 diameter
 of
 the
 chest
allowing
 the
 chest
 wall
 to
 return
 to
 its
 relaxed
 position
 between
compressions.729–732

Drugs
Drugs
 are
 rarely
 indicated
 in
 resuscitation
 of
 the
 newly
 born
infant.
 Bradycardia
 in
 the
 newborn
 infant
 is
 usually
 caused
 by
inadequate
 lung
 inﬂation
 or
 profound
 hypoxia,
 and
 establishing
adequate
 ventilation
 is
 the
 most
 important
 step
 to
 correct
 it.
 How-
ever,
 if
 the
 heart
 rate
 remains
 less
 than
 60
 beats
 min−1 despite
adequate
 ventilation
 and
 chest
 compressions,
 it
 is

 the
 use
 of
 drugs.
 These
 are

 via
 a

itioned
 umbilical
 venous
 catheter
 (Fig.

Adrenaline.
 Despite
 the
 lack
 of
 human
 data
 it
 is
 reasonable
 to
use
 adrenaline
 when
 adequate
 ventilation
 and
 chest
 compres-
sions
 have
 failed
 to
 increase
 the
 heart
 rate
 above
 60
 beats

 dose
 of
 10
 micrograms

(0.1
 ml

 intravenously
 as

ble
 with
 subsequent
 intravenous
 doses
 of
 10–30

(0.1–0.3

Bicarbonate.
 There
 are

 in

 of
1–2
 mmol
 kg−1 by

 have

Fluids

 there
 has
 been

 or
 the

 appears
 to
 be
in
 shock
 (pale,
 poor
 perfusion,
 weak

 and
 has
 not
 responded
adequately
 to
 other
 resuscitative
 measures
 then
 consider
 giving

 is
 a
 rare
 event.

give
 a

Withholding
 or
 discontinuing
 resuscitation
Mortality
 and
 morbidity
 for
 newborns
 varies
 according
 to
region
 and
 to
 availability
 of
 resources.741 Opinions
 vary
 amongst
providers,
 parents
 and
 societies
 about
 the
 balance
 of
 beneﬁts
 and
disadvantages
 of
 using
 aggressive
 therapies
 in
 such
 babies.742,743
Discontinuing
 resuscitation
Local
 and
 national
 committees
 will
 deﬁne
 recommendations
 for
stopping
 resuscitation.
 If
 the
 heart
 rate
 of
 a
 newly
 born
 baby
 is
 not
detectable
 and
 remains
 undetectable
 for
 10
 min,
 it
 may
 be
 appro-
priate
 to
 consider
 stopping
 resuscitation.
 The
 decision
 should
 be
individualised.
 In
 cases
 where
 the
 heart
 rate
 is
 less
 than
 60
 min−1
at
 birth
 and
 does
 not
 improve
 after
 10
 or
 15
 min
 of
 continuous
 and
apparently
 adequate
 resuscitative
 efforts,
 the
 choice
 is
 much
 less
clear
 and
 ﬁrm
 guidance
 cannot
 be
 given.
Withholding
 resuscitation
It
 is
 possible
 to
 identify
 conditions
 associated
 with
 high
 mor-
tality
 and
 poor
 outcome,
 where
 withholding
 resuscitation
 may
 be
considered
 reasonable,
 particularly
 when
 there
 has
 been
 the
 oppor-
tunity
 for
 discussion
 with
 parents.744–746 There

 When

or
 withholding
 resuscitation,
 care
 should
 be
 focused
 on
 the
 comfort
and
 dignity
 of
 the
 baby
 and
 family.
Communication
 with
 the
 parents
It
 is
 important
 that
 the
 team
 caring
 for
 the
 newborn
 baby
informs
 the
 parents
 of
 the
 baby’s
 progress.
 At
 delivery,
 adhere
 to
 the
routine
 local
 plan
 and,
 if
 possible,
 hand
 the
 baby
 to
 the
 mother
 at
 the
earliest
 opportunity.
 If
 resuscitation
 is
 required
 inform
 the
 parents
of
 the
 procedures
 undertaken
 and
 why
 they
 were
 required.
 Par-
ents’
 wishes
 to
 be
 present
 during
 resuscitation
 should
 be
 supported
where
 possible.747
Post-resuscitation
 care
Babies
 who
 have
 required
 resuscitation
 may
 later
 deteriorate.
Once
 adequate
 ventilation
 and
 circulation
 are
 established,
 the
infant
 should
 be
 maintained
 in
 or
 transferred
 to
 an
 environment
in
 which
 close

 and

 can
 be
 provided.
Glucose
The
 range
 of
 blood
 glucose
 concentration
 that
 is
 associated
 with
the
 least
 brain
 injury
 following
 asphyxia
 and
 resuscitation
 cannot
be
 deﬁned
 based
 on
 available
 evidence.
 Infants
 who
 require
 sig-
niﬁcant
 resuscitation
 should
 be
 monitored
 and
 treated
 to
 maintain
glucose
 in
 the
 normal
 range.

 hypothermia
Newly
 born
 infants
 born
 at

 or
 near-term
 with
 evolving
moderate

where

 and

 are
 both
 appropriate
 strate-
gies.
 There
 is
 no
 evidence
 in
 human

 that
 cooling
 is
effective
 if

 than

Prognostic
 tools
Although

 in
 clinical
 practice,
 for
 research
 pur-
poses
 and
 as
 a
 prognostic
 tool,750 the
 applicability
 of
 the
 APGAR

 has
 been
 questioned
 due
 to
 large
 inter-
 and
 intra-observer

 These
 are
 partly
 explained
 by
 a
 lack
 of

 on
how
 to

Initial
 management
 of
 acute
 coronary
 syndromes
The
 term
 acute
 coronary
 syndrome
 (ACS)
 encompasses
 three
different
 entities
 of
 the
 acute
 manifestation
 of
 coronary
 heart
 dis-
ease
 (Fig.
 1.33):
 ST
 elevation
 myocardial
 infarction
 (STEMI),
 non-ST
elevation
 myocardial
 infarction
 and
 unstable
 angina
 pectoris
 (UAP).
Non-ST
 elevation
 myocardial
 infarction
 and
 UAP
 are
 usually
 com-
bined
 in
 the
 term
 non-STEMI-ACS.
 The
 common
 pathophysiology
of
 ACS
 is
 a
 ruptured
 or
 eroded
 atherosclerotic
 plaque.753 Elec-
trocardiographic
 (ECG)
 characteristics
 (absence
 or
 presence
 of
 ST
elevation)
 differentiate
 STEMI
 from
 non-STEMI
 ACS.
 The

Acute
 coronary
 syndromes
 are
 the
 commonest
 cause
 of
 malig-
nant
 arrhythmias
 leading
 to
 sudden
 cardiac
 death.
 The
 therapeutic
goals
 are
 to
 treat
 acute
 life-threatening
 conditions,
 such
 as
 ven-
tricular
 ﬁbrillation
 (VF)
 or
 extreme
 bradycardia,
 and
 to
 preserve
left
 ventricular
 function
 and
 prevent
 heart
 failure
 by
 minimising
the
 extent
 of
 myocardial
 damage.
 The
 current
 guidelines
 address
the
 ﬁrst
 hours
 after
 onset
 of
 symptoms.
 Out-of-hospital
 treatment
and
 initial
 therapy
 in
 the
 emergency
 department
 (ED)
 may
 vary
according
 to
 local
 capabilities,
 resources
 and
 regulations.
 These
 rec-
ommendations
 are
 consistent
 with
 the
 guidelines
 for
 the
 diagnosis
and
 treatment
 of
 ACS
 with
 and
 without
 ST
 elevation
 published
 by
the
 European
 Society
 of

Diagnosis
 and
 risk
 stratiﬁcation
 in
 acute
 coronary
 syndromes
Signs
 and
 symptoms
 of
 ACS
Typically
 ACS
 appears
 with
 symptoms
 such
 as
 radiating
 chest
pain,
 shortness
 of
 breath
 and
 sweating;
 however,
 atypical
 symp-
toms
 or
 unusual
 presentations
 may
 occur
 in
 the
 elderly,
 in
 females,
and
 in
 diabetics.
 None
 of
 these
 signs
 and
 symptoms
 of
 ACS
 can
 be
used
 alone
 for
 the
 diagnosis
 of
 ACS.
 A
 reduction
 in
 chest
 pain
 after
nitroglycerin
 administration
 can
 be
 misleading
 and
 is
 not
 recom-
mended
 as
 a
 diagnostic
 manoeuvre.755 Symptoms
 may
 be
 more
intense
 and
 last
 longer
 in
 patients
 with
 STEMI
 but
 are
 not
 reliable
for
 discriminating
 between
 STEMI
 and
 non-STEMI-ACS.424,756–758
12-lead
 ECG
When
 an
 ACS
 is
 suspected,
 a
 12-lead-ECG
 should
 be
 acquired
and
 interpreted
 as
 soon
 as
 possible
 after
 ﬁrst
 patient
 contact,
 to
facilitate
 early
 diagnosis
 and
 triage.754,756,758 STEMI
 is
 typically
diagnosed

 in
 the
 absence
 of

 or

 block

 patients
 with
clinical
 suspicion
 of
 ongoing
 myocardial
 ischaemia
 with
 new
 or
presumed
 new
 LBBB,
 consider
 prompt
 reperfusion
 therapy,
 prefer-
ably
 using
 primary
 PCI
 (PPCI).
 Right
 precordial
 leads
 should
 be
recorded
 in
 all
 patients
 with
 inferior
 STEMI
 in
 order
 to
 detect
 right
ventricular
 MI.
Recording
 of
 a
 12-lead
 ECG
 out-of-hospital
 enables
 advanced
notiﬁcation
 to
 the
 receiving
 facility
 and
 expedites
 treatment
 deci-
sions
 after
 hospital
 arrival.
 In
 many
 studies,
 using
 pre-hospital
12-lead
 ECG,
 the
 time
 from
 hospital
 admission
 to
 initiating
 reper-
fusion
 therapy
 is
 reduced
 by
 10
 to
 60
 minutes.
 This
 is
 associated
with
 shorter
 times
 to
 reperfusion
 and
 improved
 patient
 survival
 in
both
 patients
 with
 PCI
 and
 those
 undergoing
 ﬁbrinolysis.759–767
Trained
 EMS
 personnel
 (emergency
 physicians,
 paramedics
 and
nurses)
 can
 identify
 STEMI
 with
 a
 high
 speciﬁcity
 and
 sensi-
tivity
 comparable
 to
 diagnostic
 accuracy
 in
 the
 hospital.768,769
It
 is
 thus
 reasonable
 that
 paramedics
 and
 nurses
 be
 trained
to
 diagnose
 STEMI
 without
 direct
 medical
 consultation,
 as
 long
as
 there
 is
 strict
 concurrent
 provision
 of
 quality
 assurance.
 If
interpretation
 of
 the
 pre-hospital
 ECG
 is
 not
 available
 on-site,
computer
 interpretation770,771 or

 of
 the

 is
reasonable.762,770–777

In
 the

 on
 the
 ECG,
 the
 presence
 of
 a
suggestive
 history
 and
 elevated
 concentrations
 of
 biomarkers
 (tro-
ponins,

 and
 CKMB)
 characterise
 non-STEMI
 and
 distinguish
it
 from
 STEMI
 and

 respectively.

 cardiac

 assays
 can
 increase
 sensitivity
 and
accelerate
 diagnosis
 of
 MI
 in
 patients
 with
 symptoms
 suspicious
 of
cardiac
 ischaemia.778 Cardiac
 biomarker
 testing
 should
 be
 part
 of
the
 initial
 evaluation
 of
 all
 patients
 presenting
 to
 the
 ED
 with
 symp-
toms
 suggestive
 of
 cardiac
 ischaemia.
 However,
 the
 delay
 in
 release
of
 biomarkers
 from
 damaged
 myocardium
 prevents
 their
 use
 in
diagnosing
 myocardial
 infarction
 in
 the
 ﬁrst
 hours
 after
 the
 onset
 of
symptoms.
 For
 patients
 who
 present
 within
 6
 h
 of
 symptom
 onset,
and
 have
 an
 initial
 negative
 cardiac
 troponin,
 biomarkers
 should
be
 measured
 again
 between
 2–3
 and
 up
 to
 6
 h
 later
 for
 hs-cTn
 (12
 h
with
 regular
 troponin).
In
 patients
 suspected
 of
 an
 ACS
 the
 combination
 of
 an
 unre-
markable
 past
 history
 and
 physical
 examination
 with
 negative
initial
 ECG
 and
 biomarkers
 cannot
 be
 used
 to
 exclude
 ACS
 reliably.
Therefore
 a
 follow
 up
 period
 is
 mandatory
 in
 order
 to
 reach
 a
 diag-
nosis
 and
 make
 therapeutic
 decisions.
 At
 some
 point
 after
 AMI
 is
excluded,
 the
 evaluation
 of
 the
 patient
 should
 be
 complemented
 by
either
 a
 non-invasive
 evaluation
 for
 anatomical
 coronary
 disease
 or
provocative
 testing
 for
 inducible
 myocardial
 ischaemia.
Imaging
 techniques
Effective
 screening
 of
 patients
 with
 suspected
 ACS,
 but
 with
negative
 ECG
 and
 negative
 cardiac
 biomarkers,
 remains
 chal-
lenging.
 Non
 invasive
 imaging
 techniques
 (CT
 angiography,779
cardiac
 magnetic
 resonance,
 myocardial
 perfusion
 imaging,780 and
echocardiography781)
 have
 been
 evaluated
 as
 means
 of
 screening
these
 low-risk
 patients
 and
 identifying
 subgroups
 that
 can
 be
 dis-
charged
 home
 safely.782–785 Echocardiography
 should
 be
 routinely
available
 in
 the
 ED,
 and
 used
 in
 all
 patients
 with
 suspected
 ACS.
Multi-detector
 computer
 tomography
 coronary
 angiography
(MDCTCA)
 has
 been
 recently
 proposed
 in
 the
 management
 acute
chest
 pain
 in
 the
 ED.
 In
 a
 recent
 meta-analysis,
 MDCTCA
 demon-
strated
 a
 high
 sensitivity
 and
 a
 low
 negative
 likelihood
 ratio
 of
0.06,
 and
 was
 effective
 in
 ruling
 out
 the
 presence
 of
 ACS
 in
 low
to
 intermediate
 risk
 patients
 presenting
 to
 the
 ED
 with
 acute
 chest
pain.786 But
 the
 inability
 of
 anatomical
 ﬁndings
 to
 prove
 the
 pres-
ence
 of
 ischaemia,
 the
 cancer
 risk
 induced
 by
 radiation
 exposure
and
 potential
 overuse
 still
 raise
 concerns
 about
 the
 relevance
 of
this
 strategy.
Treatment
 of
 acute
 coronary
 syndromes
 –

Nitrates
Glyceryl
 trinitrate
 may
 be
 considered
 if
 the
 systolic
 blood
 pres-
sure
 (SBP)
 is
 above
 90
 mmHg
 and
 the
 patient
 has
 ongoing
 ischaemic
chest
 pain
 (Fig.
 1.34).
 Glyceryl
 trinitrate
 can
 also
 be
 useful
 in
 the
treatment
 of
 acute
 pulmonary
 congestion.
 Do
 not
 use
 nitrates
 in
patients
 with
 hypotension
 (SBP
 ≤
 90
 mmHg),
 particularly
 if
 com-
bined
 with
 bradycardia,
 and
 in
 patients
 with
 inferior
 infarction
and
 suspected
 right
 ventricular
 involvement.
 Give
 glyceryl
 trini-
trate
 0.4
 mg  sublingual
 or
 equivalent
 every
 5
 min
 up
 to
 3
 doses
 as
SBP
 allows.
 Begin
 IV
 dosing
 at
 10
 g
 min−1 for
 persistent
 pain
 or
pulmonary
 oedema;
 titrate
 to
 desired
 BP
 effect.
Analgesia
Morphine
 is
 the
 analgesic
 of
 choice
 for
 nitrate-refractory
 pain
and
 also
 has
 calming
 effects
 on
 the
 patient
 making
 sedatives
unnecessary
 in
 most
 cases.
 Since
 morphine
 is
 a
 dilator
 of
 venous
capacitance
 vessels,
 it
 may
 have
 additional
 beneﬁt
 in
 patients
 with
pulmonary
 congestion.
 Give
 morphine
 in
 initial
 doses
 of
 3–5
 mg
intravenously
 and
 repeat
 every
 few
 minutes
 until
 the
 patient
 is
pain-free.
 Avoid
 non-steroidal
 anti-inﬂammatory
 drugs
 (NSAIDs)
for
 analgesia
 because
 they
 have
 pro-thrombotic
 effects.787
Oxygen
Evidence
 is
 accumulating
 about
 the
 questionable
 role
 of
 sup-
plemental
 oxygen
 in
 cardiac
 arrest,
 after
 ROSC
 and
 in
 ACS.
 Patients
with
 acute
 chest
 pain
 with
 presumed
 ACS
 do
 not
 need
 supplemen-
tal
 oxygen
 unless
 they
 present
 with
 signs
 of
 hypoxia,
 dyspnoea
 or
heart
 failure.
 There
 is
 increasing
 evidence
 suggesting
 that
 hyper-
oxia
 may
 be
 harmful
 in
 patients
 with
 uncomplicated
 myocardial
infarction.393,788–790 During
 cardiac
 arrest,
 use
 100%
 oxygen.
 After
ROSC,
 titrate
 the
 inspired
 oxygen
 concentration
 to
 achieve
 arterial
blood
 oxygen
 saturation
 in
 the
 range
 of
 94–98%,
 or
 88–92
 in
 chronic
obstructive
 pulmonary
 disease.424,791

Platelet

Reperfusion
 strategy
 in
 patients
 presenting
 with
 STEMI
Reperfusion
 therapy
 in
 patients
 with
 STEMI
 is
 the
 most
 impor-
tant
 advance
 in
 the
 treatment
 of
 myocardial
 infarction
 in
 the
 last
 30
years.
 Reperfusion
 may
 be
 achieved
 with
 ﬁbrinolysis,
 with
 PPCI,
 or
a
 combination
 of
 both.
 Efﬁcacy
 of
 reperfusion
 therapy
 is
 profoundly
dependent
 on
 the
 time
 interval
 from
 symptom
 onset
 to
 reperfusion.
Fibrinolysis
 is
 effective
 speciﬁcally
 in
 the
 ﬁrst
 2–3
 h
 after
 symptom
onset;
 PPCI
 is
 less
 time
 sensitive.

Fibrinolysis
Giving
 ﬁbrinolytics
 to
 out-of-hospital
 to
 patients
 with
 STEMI
 or
signs
 and
 symptoms
 of
 an
 ACS
 with
 presumed
 new
 LBBB
 is
 beneﬁ-
cial.
 The
 efﬁcacy
 is
 greatest
 early
 after
 onset
 of
 symptoms.
 Patients
with
 symptoms
 of
 ACS
 and
 ECG
 evidence
 of
 STEMI
 (or
 presumably
new
 LBBB
 or
 true
 posterior
 infarction)
 presenting
 directly
 to
 the
ED
 should
 be
 given
 ﬁbrinolytic
 therapy
 as
 soon
 as
 possible
 unless
there
 is
 timely
 access
 to
 PPCI.
 The
 real
 advantage
 of
 prehospital
ﬁbrinolysis
 is
 where
 there
 are
 long
 transport
 times,
 i.e.
 >30–60
 min.
Healthcare
 professionals
 who
 give
 ﬁbrinolytic
 therapy
 must
 be
aware
 of
 its
 contraindications
 and
 risks.
 Patients
 with
 large
 AMIs
(e.g.
 indicated
 by
 extensive
 ECG
 changes)
 are
 likely
 to
 gain
 most
from
 ﬁbrinolytic
 therapy.
 Beneﬁts
 of
 ﬁbrinolytic
 therapy
 are
 less
impressive
 in
 inferior
 wall
 infarctions
 than
 in
 anterior
 infarctions.
Primary
 percutaneous
 intervention
Coronary
 angioplasty
 with
 or
 without
 stent
 placement
 has
become
 the
 ﬁrst-line
 treatment
 for
 patients
 with
 STEMI.
 PPCI
 per-
formed
 with
 a
 limited
 delay
 to
 ﬁrst
 balloon
 inﬂation
 after
 ﬁrst
medical
 contact,
 at
 a
 high-volume
 centre,
 by
 an
 experienced
 oper-
ator
 who
 maintains
 an
 appropriate
 expert
 status,
 is
 the
 preferred
treatment
 as
 it
 improves
 morbidity
 and
 mortality
 as
 compared
 with
immediate
 ﬁbrinolysis.793
Fibrinolysis
 versus
 primary
 PCI
Primary
 PCI
 has
 been
 limited
 by
 access
 to
 catheter
 labora-
tory
 facilities,
 appropriately
 skilled
 clinicians
 and
 delay
 to
 ﬁrst
balloon
 inﬂation.
 Fibrinolysis
 therapy
 is
 a
 widely
 available
 reper-
fusion
 strategy.
 Both
 treatment
 strategies
 are
 well
 established
and
 have
 been
 the
 subject
 of
 large
 randomised
 multicentre
 tri-
als
 over
 the
 last
 decades.
 Time
 from
 onset
 of
 symptoms
 and
 PPCI
related
 delay
 (diagnosis
 to
 balloon
 interval
 minus
 the
 diagno-
sis
 to
 needle
 interval)
 are
 key
 in
 selecting
 the
 most
 appropriate
revascularisation
 strategy.
 Fibrinolytic
 therapy
 is
 most
 effective
 in
patients
 presenting
 within
 2–3
 h
 from
 onset
 of
 ischaemic
 symp-
toms.
 It
 compares
 favourably
 with
 PPCI
 when
 started
 within
 2
 h
from
 symptom
 onset
 and
 is
 combined
 with
 rescue
 or
 delayed
 PCI.
 In
early
 presenters,
 patients
 of
 younger
 age
 and
 large
 anterior
 infarc-
tions,
 PPCI
 related
 delays
 of
 60
 min
 may
 be
 unacceptable
 while
in
 late
 presenters
 (>3
 h
 from
 the
 onset
 of
 symptoms)
 PPCI
 related
delays
 of
 up
 to
 120
 min
 may
 be
 acceptable.794
Improving
 the
 systems
 of
 care
 may
 signiﬁcantly
 shorten
 time
delay
 to
 PPCI795,796:
• A
 pre-hospital
 ECG
 should
 be
 acquired
 as
 soon
 as
 possible
 and
interpreted
 for
 the
 diagnosis
 of
 STEMI.
 This
 can
 reduce
 mortality
in
 both
 patients
 planned
 for
 PPCI
 and
 ﬁbrinolytic
 therapy.
• STEMI
 recognition
 may
 be
 accomplished
 by
 ECG
 transmission
 or
onsite
 interpretation
 by
 physicians,
 or
 highly
 trained
 nurses
 or
paramedics,
 with
 or
 without
 the
 aid
 of
 computer
 ECG
 interpreta-
tion.
• When
 PPCI
 is
 the
 planned
 strategy,
 pre-hospital
 activation
 of
catheterisation
 laboratory
 for
 PPCI
 will
 contribute
 to
 a
 mortality
beneﬁt.797
Additional
 elements
 for
 an
 effective
 system
 of
 care
 include:
• Requiring
 the
 catheterisation
 laboratory
 to
 be
 ready
 within
20
 min
 available
 24/7.
• Providing
 real-time
 data
 feedback
 on
 the
 real
 time
 course
 from
symptom
 onset
 to
 PCI
For
 those
 patients
 with
 a
 contraindication
 to
 ﬁbrinolysis,
 PCI
should
 still
 be
 pursued
 despite
 the
 delay,
 rather
 than
 not
 provid-
ing
 reperfusion
 therapy
 at
 all.
 For
 those
 STEMI
 patients
 presenting
in
 shock,
 primary
 PCI
 (or
 coronary

 bypass
 surgery)
 is

 only
 be
 con-

 if
 there
 is
 a
 substantial

Triage
 and
 inter-facility
 transfer
 for
 primary
 PCI
The
 majority
 of
 patients
 with
 an
 ongoing
 STEMI
 will
 be
 ﬁrst
diagnosed
 either
 in
 the
 pre-hospital
 environment
 or
 in
 the
 setting
of
 the
 ED
 of
 a
 non-PCI
 capable
 hospital.
 When
 PCI
 can
 be
 per-
formed
 within
 a
 time
 limit
 of
 60–90
 min,
 then
 direct
 triage
 and
transport
 for
 PCI
 is
 preferred
 to
 pre-hospital
 ﬁbrinolysis.797–801 For
adult
 patients
 presenting
 with
 STEMI
 in
 the
 ED
 of
 a
 non-PCI
 capa-
ble
 hospital
 emergent
 transfer
 without
 ﬁbrinolysis
 to
 a
 PCI
 centre
should
 be
 considered
 provided
 that
 PPCI
 can
 be
 performed
 within
acceptable
 time
 delays.
It
 is
 less
 clear
 whether
 immediate
 ﬁbrinolytic
 therapy
 (in-
 or
out-of-hospital)
 or
 transfer
 for
 PPCI
 is
 superior
 for
 younger
 patients
presenting
 with
 anterior
 infarction
 and
 within
 a
 short
 duration
of
 <2–3
 h.794 Transfer
 of
 STEMI
 patients
 for
 PPCI
 is
 reasonable
 for
those
 presenting
 more
 than
 3
 h
 but
 less
 than
 12
 h
 after
 the
 onset
 of
symptoms,
 provided
 that
 the
 transfer
 can
 be
 achieved
 rapidly.
Combination
 of
 ﬁbrinolysis
 and
 percutaneous

Fibrinolysis
 and
 PCI
 may
 be
 used
 in

 of
 combina-
tions
 to
 restore

 ﬂow
 and

It
 is
 reasonable
 to
 perform
 angiography
 and
 PCI
 in
 patients
 with
failed
 ﬁbrinolysis
 according
 to
 clinical
 signs
 and/or
 insufﬁcient
ST-segment
 resolution.807 In
 case
 of
 clinically
 successful
 ﬁbri-
nolysis
 (evidenced
 by
 clinical
 signs
 and
 ST-segment
 resolution
>50%),
 angiography
 delayed
 by
 several
 hours
 after
 ﬁbrinolysis
 (the
pharmaco-invasive
 approach)
 has
 been
 shown
 to
 improve
 out-
come.
 This
 strategy
 includes
 early
 transfer
 for
 angiography
 and
 PCI
if
 necessary
 after
 ﬁbrinolytic
 treatment.
Special
 situations
Cardiogenic
 shock.
 Acute
 coronary
 syndrome
 (ACS)
 is
 the
 most
common
 cause
 of
 cardiogenic
 shock,
 mainly
 through
 a
 large
 zone
of
 myocardial
 ischaemia
 or
 a
 mechanical
 complication
 of
 myocar-
dial
 infarction.
 Although
 uncommon,
 the
 short-term
 mortality
 of
cardiogenic
 shock
 is
 up
 to
 40%808 contrasting
 with
 a
 good
 qual-
ity
 of
 life
 in
 patients
 discharged
 alive.
 An
 early
 invasive
 strategy
(i.e.
 primary
 PCI,
 PCI
 early
 after
 ﬁbrinolysis)
 is
 indicated
 for
 those
patients
 who
 are
 suitable
 for
 revascularisation.809 Observational
studies
 suggest
 that
 this
 strategy
 could
 be
 also
 beneﬁcial
 in
 elderly
patients
 (over
 75
 years).
 Even
 if
 commonly
 used
 in
 clinical
 practice,
there
 is
 no
 evidence
 supporting
 the
 use
 of
 IABP
 in
 cardiogenic
shock.808

 The
 invasive
 management
 of
patients
 with
 return
 of
 spontaneous
 circulation
 (ROSC)
 after
 car-
diac
 arrest
 (i.e.
 early
 coronary
 angiography
 (CAG)
 followed
 by
immediate
 PCI
 if
 deemed
 necessary),
 particularly
 patients
 after
 pro-
longed
 resuscitation
 and
 having
 nonspeciﬁc
 ECG
 changes,
 has
 been
controversial
 due
 to
 the
 lack
 of
 speciﬁc
 evidence
 and
 signiﬁcant
implications
 on
 resource
 utilisation
 (including
 transfer
 of
 patients
to
 PCI
 centres).
PCI
 following
 ROSC
 with
 ST-elevation.
 
The
 highest
 prevalence
of
 acute
 coronary
 lesion
 is
 observed
 in
 patients
 with
 ST
 segment
elevation
 (STE)
 or
 left
 bundle
 branch
 block
 (LBBB)
 on
 post-ROSC
electrocardiogram
 (ECG).
 There
 is
 no
 randomised
 study
 but
 as
 many
observational
 studies
 reported
 a
 beneﬁt
 regarding
 survival
 and
neurological
 outcome,
 it
 is
 highly
 probable
 that
 this
 early
 invasive
management
 is
 a
 strategy
 associated
 with
 a
 clinically
 relevant
 ben-
eﬁt
 in
 patients
 with
 ST
 segment
 elevation.
 A
 recent
 meta-analysis
indicates
 that
 early
 angiography
 is
 associated
 with
 reduction
 of
hospital
 mortality
 [OR
 0.35
 (0.31–0.41)]
 and
 increased
 neurolog-
ically
 favourable
 survival
 [OR
 2.54
 (2.17–2.99)].797
Based
 on
 the
 available
 data,
 emergent
 cardiac
 catheterisation
lab
 evaluation
 (and
 immediate
 PCI
 if
 required)
 should
 be
 performed
in
 selected
 adult
 patients
 with
 ROSC
 after
 OHCA
 of
 suspected
 car-
diac
 origin
 with
 ST
 segment
 elevation
 on
 ECG.810
Observational
 studies
 also
 indicate
 that
 optimal
 outcomes
 after
OHCA
 are
 achieved
 with
 a
 combination
 of
 targeted
 temperature
management
 and
 PCI,
 which
 can
 be
 combined
 in
 a
 standard-
ised
 post-cardiac-arrest
 protocol
 as
 part
 of
 an
 overall
 strategy
 to
improve
 neurologically
 intact
 survival
 in
 this
 patient
 group.

In
 patients

 data
 are
 conﬂicting
regarding
 the
 potential
 beneﬁt
 of
 an
 emergent

 evaluation,
 all
 coming
 from
 observational

 is
 reasonable
 to
 discuss
 an
 emergent
cardiac
 catheterisation
 lab
 evaluation
 after
 ROSC
 in
 patients
 with
the
 highest
 risk
 of
 coronary
 cause
 of

 A
 variety
 of
 factors
 such
as
 patient
 age,
 duration
 of

 haemodynamic
 instability,
 pre-
senting
 cardiac
 rhythm,
 neurologic
 status
 upon
 hospital
 arrival,
 and
perceived
 likelihood
 of
 cardiac
 aetiology
 can
 inﬂuence
 the
 decision
to
 undertake
 the
 intervention.
 In
 patients
 who
 present
 in
 a
 non-
PCI
 centre
 transfer
 for
 angiography
 and
 PPCI
 if
 indicated
 should
 be
considered
 on
 an
 individual
 basis,
 weighing
 the
 expected
 beneﬁts
from

 against
 the
 risks
 from

 transport.
First
 aid
First
 aid
 is
 deﬁned
 as
 the
 helping
 behaviours
 and
 initial
 care
provided
 for
 an
 acute
 illness
 or
 injury.
 First
 aid
 can
 be
 initiated
 by
anyone
 in
 any
 situation.
 A
 ﬁrst
 aid
 provider
 is
 deﬁned
 as
 someone
trained
 in
 ﬁrst
 aid
 who
 should:
• recognise,
 assess
 and
 prioritise
 the
 need
 for
 ﬁrst
 aid
• provide
 care
 using
 appropriate
 competencies
• recognise
 limitations
 and
 seek
 additional
 care
 when
 needed
The
 goals
 of
 ﬁrst
 aid
 are
 to
 preserve
 life,
 alleviate
 suffering,
prevent
 further
 illness
 or
 injury,
 and
 promote
 recovery.
 This
 2015
deﬁnition
 for
 ﬁrst
 aid,
 as
 created
 by
 the
 ILCOR
 First
 Aid
 Task
 Force,
addresses
 the
 need
 to
 recognise
 injury
 and
 illness,
 the
 requirement
to
 develop
 a
 speciﬁc
 skill
 base
 and
 the
 need
 for
 ﬁrst
 aid
 providers
to
 simultaneously
 provide
 immediate
 care
 and
 to
 activate
 emer-
gency
 medical
 services
 or
 other
 medical
 care
 as
 required.811 First
aid
 assessments
 and
 interventions
 should
 be
 medically
 sound
 and
based
 on
 scientiﬁc
 evidence-based
 medicine
 or,
 in
 the
 absence
 of
such
 evidence,
 on
 expert
 medical
 consensus.
 The
 scope
 of
 ﬁrst
 aid
is
 not
 purely
 scientiﬁc,
 as
 both
 training
 and
 regulatory
 require-
ments
 will
 inﬂuence
 it.
 Because
 the
 scope
 of
 ﬁrst
 aid
 varies
 between
countries,
 states
 and
 provinces,
 the
 guidelines
 contained
 herein
may
 need
 to
 be
 reﬁned
 according
 to
 circumstances,
 need,
 and
 reg-
ulatory
 constraints.
First
 aid

 medical
 emergencies
Positioning
 of
 a
 breathing
 but
 unresponsive
 victim
Several
 different
 side-lying
 recovery
 positions
 have
 been
 com-
pared
 but
 overall
 no
 signiﬁcant
 differences
 between
 the
 positions
have
 been
 identiﬁed.812–814

 to
leaving

 In
 certain
 situations
 such
 as
resuscitation-related
 agonal

 or

 it
 may
 not
 be
appropriate
 to

 posi-
tion.
 Where
 there
 is
 no

 use

 a
 further
 transient

 signs815–817; the
clinical
 signiﬁcance
 of
 this
 transient

 is
 uncertain.
Oxygen
 administration
 for
 ﬁrst
 aid
There
 are
 no
 direct
 indications
 for
 the
 use
 of
 supplemental
 oxy-
gen
 by
 ﬁrst
 aid
 providers.818–821 Supplemental
 oxygen
 might
 have
potential
 adverse
 effects
 that
 complicate
 the
 disease
 course
 or
 even
worsen
 clinical
 outcomes.
 If
 used,
 supplemental
 oxygen
 should
 be
administered
 only
 by
 ﬁrst
 aid
 providers
 who
 have
 been
 properly
trained
 in
 its
 use
 and
 if
 they
 can
 monitor
 its
 effects.
Bronchodilator
 administration
The
 administration
 of
 a
 bronchodilator
 in
 asthma
 has
 been
shown
 to
 decrease
 the
 time
 to
 resolution
 of
 symptoms
 in
 chil-
dren
 and
 to
 reduce
 the
 time
 for
 the
 subjective
 improvement
 of
dyspnoea
 in
 young
 adult
 asthma
 sufferers.822,823 Assist
 individuals
with
 asthma
 who
 are
 experiencing
 difﬁculty
 in
 breathing
 with
 their
bronchodilator
 administration.
 First
 aid
 providers
 must
 be
 trained
in
 the
 various
 methods
 of
 administering
 a
 bronchodilator.824–826
Stroke
 recognition
Stroke
 is
 a
 non-traumatic,
 focal
 vascular-induced
 injury
 of
 the
central
 nervous
 system
 and
 typically
 results
 in
 permanent
 damage
in
 the
 form
 of
 cerebral
 infarction,
 intracerebral
 haemorrhage
 and/or
subarachnoid
 haemorrhage.827 Early
 admission
 to
 a
 stroke
 centre
and
 early
 treatment
 greatly
 improves
 stroke
 outcome
 and
 high-
lights
 the
 need
 for
 ﬁrst
 aid
 providers
 to
 quickly
 recognise
 stroke
symptoms.828,829 There
 is
 good
 evidence
 that
 the
 use
 of
 a
 stroke-
screening
 tool
 improves
 the
 time
 to
 deﬁnitive
 treatment.830–833 Use
a
 stroke
 assessment
 system
 to
 decrease
 the
 time
 to
 recognition
 and
deﬁnitive
 treatment
 for
 individuals
 with
 suspected
 acute
 stroke.
First
 aid
 providers
 must
 be
 trained
 in
 the
 use
 of
 FAST
 (Face,
 Arm,
Speech
 Tool)
 or
 CPSS
 (Cincinnati
 Pre-hospital
 Stroke
 Scale)
 to
 assist
in
 the
 early
 recognition
 of
 stroke.
Aspirin
 administration
 for
 chest
 pain
The
 early
 administration
 of
 aspirin
 in
 the
 pre-hospital
 envi-
ronment,
 within
 the
 ﬁrst
 few
 hours
 of
 the
 onset
 of
 chest
 pain
due
 to
 suspected
 myocardial
 infarction,
 reduces
 cardiovascu-
lar
 mortality.834,835 In
 the
 pre-hospital
 environment,
 administer
150-300
 mg  chewable
 aspirin
 early
 to
 adults
 with
 chest
 pain
due
 to
 suspected
 myocardial
 infarction
 (ACS/AMI).
 There
 is
a
 relatively
 low
 risk
 of
 complications
 particularly
 anaphylaxis
and
 serious
 bleeding.836–840 Aspirin
 should
 not
 be
 administered
to
 patients
 who
 have
 a
 known
 allergy
 or
 contraindication
 to
aspirin.
 Do
 not
 administer
 aspirin
 to
 adults
 with
 chest
 pain
of
 unclear
 aetiology.
 The
 early
 administration
 of
 aspirin
 should
never
 delay
 the
 transfer
 of
 the
 patient
 to
 a
 hospital
 for
 deﬁnitive
care.
Second
 dose
 of
 adrenaline
 for
 anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis
 is
 a
 potentially
 fatal,
 allergic
 reaction
 that
 requires
immediate
 recognition
 and
 intervention.
 Adrenaline
 reverses
 the
pathophysiological
 manifestations
 of
 anaphylaxis
 and
 remains
 the
most
 important
 drug,
 especially
 if
 it
 is
 given
 within
 the
 ﬁrst
 few
minutes
 of
 a
 severe
 allergic
 reaction.287,841,842 In
 the
 pre-hospital
setting,
 adrenaline
 is
 administered
 via
 preﬁlled
 auto-injectors,
which
 contain
 one
 dose
 of
 300
 g
 of
 adrenaline
 (adult
 dose)
 for
intramuscular
 self-administration
 or
 assisted
 by
 a
 trained
 ﬁrst
 aid
provider.
 Administer
 a
 second
 intramuscular
 dose
 of
 adrenaline
to
 individuals
 in
 the
 pre-hospital
 environment
 with
 anaphylaxis
that
 has
 not
 been
 relieved
 within
 5–15
 minutes
 by
 an
 initial
intramuscular
 auto-injector
 dose
 of
 adrenaline.843–852 A
 second
intramuscular
 dose
 of
 adrenaline
 may
 also
 be
 required
 if
 symptoms
re-occur.
Hypoglycaemia
 treatment
Hypoglycaemia
 in
 diabetes
 patients
 is
 usually
 a
 sudden
 and
life-threatening
 event
 with
 the
 typical
 symptoms
 of
 hunger,
headache,
 agitation,
 tremor,
 sweating,
 psychotic
 behaviour
 (fre-
quently
 resembling
 drunkenness)
 and
 loss
 of
 consciousness.
 It
 is
most
 important
 that
 these
 symptoms
 are
 recognised
 as
 hypo-
glycaemia
 as
 the
 victim
 requires
 rapid
 ﬁrst
 aid
 treatment.
 Treat
conscious
 patients
 with
 symptomatic
 hypoglycaemia
 with
 glu-
cose
 tablets
 equating
 to
 glucose
 15–20
 g.
 If
 glucose
 tablets
 are
 not
available,
 use
 other
 dietary
 forms
 of
 sugar.853–855 If
 the
 patient
 is
unconscious
 or
 unable
 to
 swallow
 then
 oral
 treatment
 should
 be
withheld
 due
 to
 the
 risk
 of
 aspiration,
 and
 the
 emergency
 medical
services
 should
 be
 called.
Exertion-related
 dehydration
 and
 rehydration
 therapy
First
 
aid
 
providers
 
are
 
often
 
called
 
upon
 
to
 
assist
 
at
“hydration
 
stations”
 
for
 
sporting
 
events.
 
Use
 
3–8%
 
oral
carbohydrate–electrolyte
 
(CE)
 
beverages
 
for
 
rehydration
 
of
individuals
 
with
 
simple
 
exercise-induced
 
dehydration.856–864
Alternative
 acceptable
 beverages
 for
 rehydration
 include
 water,
12%
 CE
 solution,856 coconut
 water,857,863,864 2%
 milk,861 or
 tea
with
 or
 without
 carbohydrate
 electrolyte
 solution
 added.858,865
Oral
 hydration
 may
 not
 be
 appropriate
 for
 individuals
 with
 severe
dehydration
 associated
 with
 hypotension,
 hyperpyrexia
 or
 men-
tal
 status
 changes.
 Such
 individuals
 should
 receive
 care
 by
 an
advanced
 medical
 provider
 capable
 of
 administering
 intravenous
ﬂuids.
Eye
 injury
 from
 chemical
 exposure
For
 an
 eye
 injury
 due
 to
 exposure
 to
 a
 chemical
 substance,
take
 immediate
 action
 by
 irrigating
 the
 eye
 using
 continuous,
 large
volumes
 of
 clean
 water.
 Irrigation
 with
 large
 volumes
 of
 water
 was
more
 effective
 at
 improving
 corneal
 pH
 as
 compared
 to
 using
 low
volumes
 or
 saline
 irrigation.866 Refer
 the
 individual
 for
 emergency
professional
 review.
First
 aid
 for
 trauma
 emergencies
Control
 of
 bleeding
Apply
 direct
 pressure,
 with
 or
 without
 a
 dressing,
 to
 control
external
 bleeding
 where
 possible.
 Do
 not
 try
 to
 control
 major
 exter-
nal
 bleeding
 by
 the
 use
 of
 proximal
 pressure
 points
 or
 elevation
of
 an
 extremity.
 However
 it
 may
 be
 beneﬁcial
 to
 apply
 localised
cold
 therapy,
 with
 or
 without
 pressure,
 for
 minor
 or
 closed
 extrem-
ity
 bleeding.867,868 Where
 bleeding
 cannot
 be
 controlled
 by
 direct
pressure
 it
 may
 be
 possible
 to
 control
 bleeding
 by
 the
 use
 of
 a
haemostatic
 dressing
 or
 a
 tourniquet
 (see
 below).
Haemostatic
 dressings
Haemostatic
 dressings
 are
 commonly
 used
 to
 control
 bleeding
in
 the
 surgical
 and
 military
 settings
 especially
 when
 the
 wound
is
 in
 a
 non-compressible
 area
 such
 as
 the
 neck,
 abdomen,
 or
groin.869–873 Use
 a
 haemostatic
 dressing
 when
 direct
 pressure
 can-
not
 control
 severe
 external
 bleeding
 or
 the
 wound
 is
 in
 a
 position
where
 direct
 pressure
 is
 not
 possible.874–877 Training
 is
 required
 to
ensure
 the
 safe
 and
 effective
 application
 of
 these
 dressings.

Use
 of
 a
 tourniquet
Haemorrhage
 from
 vascular
 injured
 extremities
 may
 result
in
 life-threatening
 exsanguination
 and
 is
 one
 of
 the
 leading
causes
 of
 preventable
 death
 on
 the
 battleﬁeld
 and
 in
 the
 civilian
setting.878,879 Tourniquets
 have
 been
 used
 in
 military
 settings
 for
severe
 external
 limb
 bleeding
 for
 many
 years.880,881 The
 application
of
 a
 tourniquet
 has
 resulted
 in
 a
 decrease
 in
 mortality.880–889 Use
a
 tourniquet
 when
 direct
 wound
 pressure
 cannot
 control
 severe
external
 bleeding
 in
 a
 limb.
 Training
 is
 required
 to
 ensure
 the
 safe
and
 effective
 application
 of
 a
 tourniquet.
Straightening
 an
 angulated
 fracture
Fractures,
 dislocations,
 sprains
 and
 strains
 are
 extremity
 injuries
commonly
 cared
 for
 by
 ﬁrst
 aid
 providers.
 Do
 not
 straighten
 an
angulated
 long
 bone
 fracture.
Protect
 the
 injured
 limb
 by
 splinting
 the
 fracture.
 Realignment
of
 fractures
 should
 only
 be
 undertaken
 by
 those
 speciﬁcally
 trained
to
 perform
 this
 procedure.
First
 aid
 treatment
 for
 an
 open
 chest
 wound
The
 correct
 management
 of
 an
 open
 chest
 wound
 is
 critical,
as
 the
 inadvertent
 sealing
 of
 these
 wounds
 by
 the
 incorrect
 use
of
 occlusive
 dressings
 or
 device
 or
 the
 application
 of
 a
 dressing
that
 becomes
 occlusive
 may
 result
 in
 the
 potential
 life-threatening
complication
 of
 a
 tension
 pneumothorax.890 Leave
 an
 open
 chest
wound
 exposed
 to
 freely
 communicate
 with
 the
 external
 envi-
ronment
 without
 applying
 a
 dressing,
 or
 cover
 the
 wound
 with
 a
non-occlusive
 dressing
 if
 necessary.
 Control
 localised
 bleeding
 with
direct
 pressure.
Spinal
 motion
 restriction
In
 suspected
 cervical
 spine
 injury
 it
 has
 been
 routine
 to
 apply
cervical
 collars
 to
 the
 neck,
 in
 order
 to
 avoid
 further
 injury
 from
spinal
 movement.
 However,
 this
 intervention
 has
 been
 based
 on
consensus
 and
 opinion
 rather
 than
 on
 scientiﬁc
 evidence.891,892
Furthermore,
 clinically
 signiﬁcant
 adverse
 effects
 such
 as
 raised
intracranial
 pressure
 have
 been
 shown
 to
 occur
 following
 the
application
 of
 a
 cervical
 collar.893–897 The
 routine
 application
 of
a
 cervical
 collar
 by
 a
 ﬁrst
 aid
 provider
 is
 no
 longer
 recommended.
In
 suspected
 cervical
 spine
 injury,
 manually
 support
 the
 head
 in
 a
position
 limiting
 angular
 movement
 until
 experienced
 healthcare
provision
 is
 available.
Recognition
 of
 concussion
Although
 a
 concussion
 scoring
 system
 would
 greatly
 assist
 ﬁrst
aid
 providers
 in
 the
 recognition
 of
 concussion,898 there
 is
 no
 simple
validated
 scoring
 system
 in
 use
 in
 current
 practice.
 An
 individual
with
 a
 suspected
 concussion
 should
 be
 evaluated
 by
 a
 professional.
Cooling
 of
 burns
Immediate
 active
 cooling
 of
 thermal
 burns,
 deﬁned
 as
 any
method
 undertaken
 to
 decrease
 local
 tissue
 temperature,
 is
 a
 com-
mon  ﬁrst
 aid
 recommendation
 for
 many
 years.
 Cooling
 thermal
burns
 will
 minimise
 the
 resulting
 depth
 of
 the
 burn899,900 and
 pos-
sibly
 decrease
 the
 number
 of
 patients
 that
 will
 eventually
 require
hospital
 admission
 for
 treatment.901 The
 other
 perceived
 beneﬁts
of
 cooling
 are
 pain
 relief
 and
 reduction
 of
 oedema,
 reduced
 infec-
tion
 rates
 and
 a
 faster
 wound
 healing
 process.
Actively
 cool
 thermal
 burns
 as
 soon
 as
 possible
 for
 a
 minimum
of
 10
 min
 duration
 using
 water.
 Care
 must
 be
 taken
 when
 cooling
large
 thermal
 burns
 or
 burns
 in
 infants
 and
 small
 children
 so
 as
 not
to
 induce
 hypothermia.
Burn

 burn
 wound
 dressings
 are
 available,902 but
 no
scientiﬁc
 evidence
 was
 found
 to
 determine
 which
 type
 of
 dressings,
wet
 or
 dry,
 is
 most
 effective.
 Subsequent
 to
 cooling,
 burns
 should
be
 dressed
 with
 a
 loose
 sterile
 dressing.
Dental
 avulsion
Following
 a
 fall
 or
 accident
 involving
 the
 face,
 a
 tooth
 can
 be
injured
 or
 avulsed.
 Immediate
 re-implantation
 is
 the
 intervention
of
 choice
 but
 it
 is
 often
 not
 possible
 for
 ﬁrst
 aid
 providers
 to
 re-
implant
 the
 tooth
 due
 to
 a
 lack
 of
 training
 or
 skills
 in
 that
 procedure.
If
 a
 tooth
 cannot
 be
 immediately
 re-implanted,
 store
 it
 in
 Hank’s
Balanced
 Salt
 Solution.
 If
 this
 is
 not
 available
 use
 Propolis,
 egg
 white,
coconut
 water,
 ricetral,
 whole
 milk,
 saline
 or
 Phosphate
 Buffered
Saline
 (in
 order
 of
 preference)
 and
 refer
 the
 individual
 to
 a
 dentist
as
 soon
 as
 possible.
Education
 in
 ﬁrst
 aid
First
 aid
 education
 programmes,
 public
 health
 campaigns
and
 formal
 ﬁrst
 aid
 training
 are
 recommended
 in
 order
 to
improve
 prevention,
 recognition
 and
 management
 of
 injury
 and
illness.901,903,904
Principles
 of
 education
 in
 resuscitation
The
 chain
 of
 survival13 was
 extended
 to
 the
 formula
 of
 survival11
because
 it
 was
 realised
 that
 the
 goal
 of
 saving
 more
 lives
 relies
not
 only
 on
 solid
 and
 high
 quality
 science
 but
 also
 on
 the
 effective
education
 of
 lay
 people
 and
 healthcare
 professionals.905 Ultimately,
those
 who
 are
 engaged
 in
 the
 care
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
 victims
 should
be
 able
 to
 implement
 resource
 efﬁcient
 systems
 that
 can
 improve
survival
 after
 cardiac
 arrest.
Basic
 level
 training
Who
 to
 train
 and
 how
 to
 train
Basic
 life
 support
 (BLS)
 is
 the
 cornerstone
 of
 resuscitation
 and
it
 is
 well
 established
 that
 bystander
 CPR
 is
 critical
 to
 survival
in
 out-of-hospital
 cardiac
 arrests.
 Chest
 compressions
 and
 early
deﬁbrillation
 are
 the
 main
 determinants
 of
 survival
 from
 out-
of-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
 and
 there
 is
 some
 evidence
 that
 the
introduction
 of
 training
 for
 lay
 people
 has
 improved
 survival
 at
 30
days
 and
 1
 year.906,907
There
 is
 evidence
 that
 training
 lay
 people
 in
 BLS
 is
 effective
in
 improving
 the
 number
 of
 people
 willing
 to
 undertake
 BLS
 in
 a
real
 situation.908–910 For
 high-risk
 populations
 (e.g.
 areas
 where
there
 is
 high
 risk
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
 and
 low
 bystander
 response),
recent
 evidence
 shows
 that
 speciﬁc
 factors
 can
 be
 identiﬁed
 which
will
 enable
 targeted
 training
 based
 on
 the
 community’s
 unique
characteristics.911,912 There
 is
 evidence
 that
 likely
 rescuers
 in
these
 populations
 are
 unlikely
 to
 seek
 training
 on
 their
 own
 but
that
 they
 gain
 competency
 in
 BLS
 skills
 and/or
 knowledge
 after
training.913–915 They
 are
 willing
 to
 be
 trained
 and
 are
 likely
 to
 share
training
 with
 others.913,914,916–918
One
 of
 the
 most
 important
 steps
 in
 increasing
 the
 rate
 of
bystander
 resuscitation
 and
 improving
 survival
 worldwide
 is
 to
educate
 all
 school
 children.
 This
 can
 be
 achieved
 easily
 by
 teach-
ing
 children
 for
 just
 two
 hours
 per
 year,
 beginning
 at
 the
 age
 of
12
 years
 old.919 At
 that
 age,
 school
 children
 have
 a
 positive
 atti-
tude
 towards
 learning
 resuscitation
 and
 both
 medical
 professionals
and
 teachers
 require
 special
 training
 to
 achieve
 these
 results
 with
children.920
It
 has
 been
 shown
 that
 well
 trained
 EMS
 dispatchers
 are
 able
 to
improve
 bystander
 CPR
 and
 patient
 outcomes.921 However
 there
are
 concerns
 with
 their
 ability
 to
 recognise
 cardiac
 arrest
 par-
ticularly
 in
 relation
 to
 agonal
 breathing.50 Consequently
 training
of
 EMS
 dispatchers
 should
 include
 a
 focus
 on
 the
 identiﬁcation
and
 the
 signiﬁcance
 of
 agonal
 breathing,52 and
 the
 importance
 of

57
seizures
 as
 aspects
 of
 cardiac
 arrest.
 In
 addition
 EMS
 dispatchers
need
 to
 be
 taught
 simpliﬁed
 scripts
 for
 instructing
 bystanders
 in
CPR.52
BLS/AED
 curricula
 should
 be
 tailored
 to
 the
 target
 audience
 and
kept
 as
 simple
 as
 possible.
 Increasing
 access
 to
 different
 modali-
ties
 of
 training
 (e.g.
 the
 use
 of
 digital
 media,
 on-line,
 instructor-led
teaching)
 and
 self-directed
 learning,
 offer
 alternative
 means
 of
teaching
 both
 lay
 and
 professional
 providers.
 Self-instruction
 pro-
grammes
 with
 synchronous
 or
 asynchronous
 hands-on
 practice
(e.g.,
 video,
 DVD,
 on-line
 training,
 computer
 giving
 feedback
during
 training)
 appear
 to
 be
 an
 effective
 alternative
 to
 instructor-
led
 courses
 for
 laypeople
 and
 healthcare
 providers
 learning
 BLS
skills.922–926
All
 citizens
 should
 be
 taught
 how
 to
 perform
 chest
 compressions
as
 a
 minimum
 requirement.
 Ideally,
 full
 CPR
 skills
 (compres-
sions
 and
 ventilation
 using
 a
 30:2
 ratio)
 should
 be
 taught
 to
all
 citizens.
 When
 training
 is
 time-limited
 or
 opportunistic
 (e.g.,
EMS
 telephone
 instructions
 to
 a
 bystander,
 mass
 events,
 pub-
lic
 campaigns,
 internet-based
 viral
 videos),
 it
 should
 focus
 on
compression-only
 CPR.
 Local
 communities
 may
 want
 to
 consider
their
 approach
 based
 on
 their
 local
 population
 epidemiology,
 cul-
tural
 norms
 and
 bystander
 response
 rates.
 For
 those
 initially
 trained
in
 compression-only
 CPR,
 ventilation
 may
 be
 covered
 in
 sub-
sequent
 training.
 Ideally
 these
 individuals
 should
 be
 trained
 in
compression-only
 CPR
 and
 then
 offered
 training
 in
 chest
 com-
pressions
 with
 ventilation
 at
 the
 same
 training
 session.
 Those
laypersons
 with
 a
 duty
 of
 care,
 such
 as
 ﬁrst
 aid
 workers,
 lifeguards,
and
 carers,
 should
 be
 taught
 standard
 CPR
 i.e.
 chest
 compressions
and
 ventilation.
Most
 studies
 show
 that
 CPR
 skills
 decay
 within
 three
 to
 six
months
 after
 initial
 training.924,927–930 AED
 skills
 are
 retained
for
 longer
 than
 BLS
 skills
 alone.931,932 There
 is
 some
 evidence
that
 higher
 frequency,
 short
 burst
 training
 could
 potentially
enhance
 BLS
 training
 and
 reduce
 skill
 decay.928,930–932 A
 sys-
tematic
 appraisal
 of
 the
 literature
 determined
 that
 audiovisual
feedback
 devices
 during
 resuscitation
 resulted
 in
 rescuers
 provid-
ing
 chest
 compression
 parameters
 closer
 to
 recommendations
 but
no
 evidence
 was
 found
 that
 this
 translates
 into
 improved
 patient
outcomes.933
Advanced
 level
 training
Advanced
 level
 courses
 cover
 the
 knowledge,
 skills
 and
 attitudes
needed
 to
 function
 as
 part
 of
 (and
 ultimately
 lead)
 a
 resuscita-
tion
 team.
 Supportive
 evidence
 has
 emerged
 for
 blended
 learning
models
 (independent
 electronic
 learning
 coupled
 with
 a
 reduced
duration
 instructor-led
 course).
 Simulation
 training
 is
 an
 inte-
gral
 part
 of
 resuscitation
 training
 and
 showed
 improvement
 in
knowledge
 and
 skill
 performance
 compared
 to
 training
 without
simulation.934 Evidence
 that
 participants
 in
 ALS
 courses
 learn
 more
or
 better
 CPR
 by
 using
 high-ﬁdelity
 manikins
 is
 lacking.
 With
 this
 in
mind,
 high-ﬁdelity
 manikins
 can
 be
 used
 but
 if
 they
 are
 not
 avail-
able,
 the
 use
 of
 low-ﬁdelity
 manikins
 is
 acceptable
 for
 standard
advanced
 life
 support
 training.
Training
 of
 non-technical
 skills
 (NTS)
 including
 leadership
 and
team
 training
 to
 improve
 CPR
 outcome
An
 increase
 in
 hospital
 survival
 from
 paediatric
 cardiac
 arrest
and
 in
 surgical
 patients
 was
 found
 after
 implementation
 of
 team
training
 programmes.935,936 Resuscitation
 team
 performance
 has
been
 shown
 to
 improve
 in
 actual
 cardiac
 arrest
 or
 simulated
 in-
hospital
 advanced
 life
 support
 scenarios,
 when
 speciﬁc
 team
 or
leadership
 training
 is
 added
 to
 advanced
 level
 courses.937–941 If
 the
simulated
 scenario
 training
 is
 followed
 by
 debrieﬁng
 then
 learning
will
 occur,
 as
 opposed
 to
 scenario
 training
 without
 debrieﬁng.942
Studies
 have
 failed
 to
 show
 a
 difference
 between
 debrieﬁng
 with
and
 without
 the
 use
 of
 video
 clips.943,944 There
 is
 emerging
 evi-
dence
 that
 frequent
 manikin-based
 refresher
 training
 in
 the
 form
of
 low-dose
 in-situ
 training
 may
 save
 costs,
 reduce
 the
 total
 time
for
 retraining,
 and
 it
 seems
 to
 be
 preferred
 by
 the
 learners.945,946
Refresher
 training
 is
 invariably
 required
 to
 maintain
 knowledge
and
 skills;
 however,
 the
 optimal
 frequency
 for
 refresher
 training
 is
unclear.945,947–949
Implementation
 and
 change
 management
The
 
formula
 
for
 
survival
 
concludes
 
with
 
‘local
implementation’.11
The
 combination
 of
 medical
 science
 and
educational
 efﬁciency
 is
 not
 sufﬁcient
 to
 improve
 survival
 if
 there
is
 poor
 or
 absent
 implementation.
Impact
 of
 guidelines
In
 each
 country,
 resuscitation
 practice
 is
 largely
 based
 on
 the
implementation
 of
 internationally
 agreed
 resuscitation
 guidelines.
Studies
 about
 the
 impact
 of
 international
 resuscitation
 guide-
lines
 suggest
 a
 positive
 effect
 on
 CPR
 performance,906,950 return
of
 spontaneous
 circulation105,906,950–953 and
 survival
 to
 hospital
discharge.105,906,950–954
Use
 of
 technology
 and
 social
 media
The
 prevalence
 of
 smartphones
 and
 tablet
 devices
 has
 led
 to
 the
generation
 of
 numerous
 approaches
 to
 implementation
 through
the
 use
 of
 ‘apps’
 and
 also
 social
 media.
Measuring
 performance
 of
 resuscitation
 systems
As
 systems
 evolve
 to
 improve
 the
 outcomes
 from
 cardiac
 arrest,
we
 need
 to
 accurately
 assess
 their
 impact.
 Measuring
 performance
and
 implementing
 quality
 improvement
 initiatives
 will
 further
enhance
 systems
 to
 deliver
 optimal
 results.939,955–960
Debrieﬁng
 after
 resuscitation
 in
 the
 clinical
 setting
Feedback
 to
 members
 of
 an
 in-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
 team
 about
their
 performance
 in
 an
 actual
 cardiac
 arrest
 (as
 opposed
 to
 the
training
 environment)
 can
 lead
 to
 improved
 outcomes.
 This
 can
either
 be
 real-time
 and
 data-driven
 (e.g.
 use
 of
 feedback
 devices
 on
cardiac
 compression
 metrics)
 or
 in
 a
 structured
 post-event
 perfor-
mance
 focused
 debrieﬁng.939,961
Medical
 emergency
 teams
 (MET)
 for
 adults
When
 considering
 the
 chain
 of
 survival
 for
 cardiac
 arrest,13
the
 ﬁrst
 link
 is
 the
 early
 recognition
 of
 the
 deteriorating
 patient
and
 prevention
 of
 cardiac
 arrest.
 We  recommend
 the
 use
 of
 a
MET
 because
 they
 have
 been
 associated
 with
 a
 reduced
 inci-
dence
 of
 cardiac/respiratory
 arrest962–968 and
 improved
 survival
rates.963,965–968,962,969 The
 MET
 is
 one
 part
 of
 a
 rapid
 response
 sys-
tem
 (RRS),
 which
 includes
 staff
 education
 about
 the
 signs
 of
 patient
deterioration,
 appropriate
 and
 regular
 vital
 signs
 monitoring
 of
patients,
 clear
 guidance
 (e.g.
 via
 calling
 criteria
 or
 early
 warning
scores)
 to
 assist
 staff
 in
 the
 early
 detection
 of
 patient
 deteriora-
tion,
 a
 clear
 uniform
 system
 of
 calling
 for
 assistance
 and
 a
 clinical
response
 to
 calls
 for
 assistance.
Training
 in
 resource
 limited
 settings
There
 are
 many
 different
 techniques
 for
 teaching
 ALS
 and
BLS
 in
 resource
 limited
 settings.
 These
 include
 simulation,
 multi-
media
 learning,
 self-directed
 learning,
 limited
 instruction,
 and

 1–80
self-directed
 computer-based
 learning.
 Some
 of
 these
 techniques
are
 less
 expensive
 and
 require
 less
 instructor
 resources
 enabling
wider
 dissemination
 of
 ALS
 and
 BLS
 training.
The
 ethics
 of
 resuscitation
 and
 end-of-life
 decisions
The
 principle
 of
 patient
 autonomy
Respect
 for
 autonomy
 refers
 to
 a
 physician’s
 obligation
 to
respect
 a
 patient’s
 preferences
 and
 to
 make
 decisions
 that
 accord
with
 a
 patient’s
 values
 and
 beliefs.
 Patient-centred
 healthcare
places
 the
 patient
 at
 the
 centre
 of
 the
 decision-making
 process,
rather
 than
 as
 a
 recipient
 of
 a
 medical
 decision.
 Applying
 this
 prin-
ciple
 during
 cardiac
 arrest
 where
 the
 patient
 is
 often
 unable
 to
communicate
 preferences
 is
 challenging.970–973
The
 principle
 of
 beneﬁcence
Beneﬁcence
 implies
 that
 interventions
 must
 beneﬁt
 the
 patient
after
 assessing
 relevant
 risk
 and
 beneﬁt.
 Evidence-based
 clinical
guidelines
 exist
 to
 assist
 healthcare
 professionals
 in
 deciding
 which
treatment
 approaches
 are
 most
 appropriate.11,974,975
The
 principle
 of
 non-maleﬁcence
CPR
 has
 become
 the
 norm
 for
 most
 patients
 with
 acute,
life-threatening
 conditions.976,977 CPR
 is,
 however,
 an
 invasive
 pro-
cedure
 with
 a
 low
 likelihood
 of
 success.
 CPR
 should,
 therefore,
 not
be
 performed
 in
 futile
 cases.
 It
 is
 difﬁcult
 to
 deﬁne
 futility
 in
 a
 way
that
 is
 precise,
 prospective
 and
 applicable
 to
 the
 majority
 of
 cases.
The
 principle
 of
 justice
 and
 equitable
 access
Justice
 implies
 that
 health
 resources
 are
 distributed
 equally
 and
fairly,
 irrespective
 of
 the
 patient’s
 social
 status,
 in
 the
 absence
 of
discrimination,
 with
 the
 right
 for
 each
 individual
 to
 receive
 the
current
 standard
 of
 care.
Medical
 futility
Resuscitation
 is
 considered
 futile
 when
 the
 chances
 of
 good
quality
 survival
 are
 minimal.978 The
 decision
 not
 to
 attempt
 resus-
citation
 does
 not
 require
 the
 consent
 of
 the
 patient
 or
 of
 those
 close
to
 him,
 who
 often
 have
 unrealistic
 expectations.979,980 Decision
makers
 have
 a
 duty
 to
 consult
 the
 patient
 or
 a
 representative
 if
 the
patient
 lacks
 capacity,
 in
 accordance
 with
 a
 “clear
 and
 accessible
policy”.981–983
Some
 countries
 allow
 prospective
 decisions
 to
 withhold
 CPR
whilst
 in
 others
 countries
 or
 religions
 withholding
 CPR
 is
 not
allowed
 or
 considered
 illegal.
 There
 is
 a
 lack
 of
 consistency
 in
 terms
such
 as
 ‘do
 not
 attempt
 resuscitation
 (DNAR)’,
 ‘do
 not
 attempt
cardiopulmonary
 resuscitation
 (DNACPR)’
 or
 ‘allow
 natural
 death
(AND)’.
 This
 confusing
 use
 of
 acronyms
 may
 generate
 misunder-
standings
 in
 national
 legislation
 and
 jurisdiction.984,985
Advance
 directives
Advance
 directives
 are
 decisions
 about
 treatment
 provided
prospectively
 by
 an
 individual
 in
 case
 they
 are
 unable
 to
 participate
directly
 in
 medical
 decision-making
 at
 some
 point
 in
 the
 future.986
Periodic
 reviews
 of
 directives
 are
 required
 to
 ensure
 patients’
 cur-
rent
 wishes
 and
 circumstances
 are
 accurately
 reﬂected.979,987,988
The
 legal
 status
 of
 advance
 directives
 in
 the
 national
 legislation
of
 European
 countries
 is
 very
 disparate.989
Patient-centred
 care
The
 increasing
 centricity
 of
 the
 patient
 within
 healthcare
demands
 that
 we
 seek
 to
 understand
 the
 perspective
 of
 the
 sur-
vivor
 of
 cardiac
 arrest.
 This
 requires
 a
 further
 commitment
 to
 work
together
 with
 the
 public,
 with
 the
 survivors
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
 and
their
 families
 as
 partners
 in
 this
 process.990
In-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
Following
 in-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
 (IHCA),
 the
 default
 position
is
 to
 start
 resuscitation
 unless
 a
 decision
 was
 made
 to
 withhold
 CPR.
Resuscitation
 decisions
 should
 be
 reviewed.
 Determining
 when
CPR
 is
 likely
 to
 be
 unsuccessful
 or
 futile,
 is
 difﬁcult.
 Prediction
 stud-
ies
 are
 particularly
 dependent
 on
 system
 factors
 such
 as
 time
 to
start
 of
 CPR
 and
 time
 to
 deﬁbrillation.
 The
 total
 study
 cohort
 but
may
 not
 be
 applicable
 to
 an
 individual
 case.
 Decisions
 should
 not
 be
made
 based
 on
 a
 single
 element,
 such
 as
 age.991 There
 will
 remain
grey
 areas
 where
 judgement
 is
 required
 for
 individual
 patients.
Out-of-hospital
 cardiac
 arrest
The
 decision
 to
 start
 or
 discontinue
 CPR
 is
 challenging
 out-
side
 a
 hospital
 because
 of
 the
 lack
 of
 sufﬁcient
 information
 about
a
 patient’s
 wishes
 and
 values,
 comorbidities
 and
 baseline
 health
status.992,993
Withholding
 or
 withdrawing
 CPR
Transport
 to
 hospital
 with
 ongoing
 CPR
Healthcare
 professionals
 should
 consider
 withholding
 or
 with-
drawing
 CPR
 in
 children
 and
 adults
 when:
• the
 safety
 of
 the
 provider
 can
 no
 be
 assured;
• there
 is
 obvious
 mortal
 injury
 or
 irreversible
 death;
• a
 valid
 advance
 directive
 becomes
 available;
• there
 is
 other
 strong
 evidence
 that
 further
 CPR
 would
 be
 against
patient’s
 values
 and
 preferences
 or
 is
 considered
 futile;
• asystole
 for
 more
 than
 20
 min
 despite
 ongoing
 ALS,
 in
 the
 absence
of
 a
 reversible
 cause.
After
 stopping
 CPR,
 the
 possibility
 of
 ongoing
 support
 of
 the
 cir-
culation
 and
 transport
 to
 a
 dedicated
 centre
 with
 the
 perspective
of
 organ
 donation
 should
 be
 considered.
Healthcare
 professionals
 should
 consider
 transport
 to
 hospital
with
 ongoing
 CPR
 when,
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 the
 above
 CPR
 with-
drawal
 criteria,
 there
 is
 one
 or
 more
 of
 the
 following
 present:
• EMS
 witnessed
 arrest
• ROSC
 at
 any
 moment
• VT/VF
 as
 presenting
 rhythm
• Presumed
 reversible
 cause
 (e.g.
 cardiac,
 toxic,
 hypothermia)
This
 decision
 should
 be
 considered
 early
 in
 the
 process
 e.g.
 after
10
 min
 of
 ALS
 without
 ROSC
 and
 in
 view
 of
 the
 circumstances
 e.g.
distance,
 CPR
 delay
 and
 presumed
 CPR
 quality
 in
 view
 of
 patient
characteristics
Paediatric
 cardiac
 arrest
Despite
 differences
 in
 pathophysiology
 and
 aetiology,
 the
 ethi-
cal
 framework
 for
 decision-making
 in
 paediatric
 cardiac
 arrest
 does
not
 differ
 much.
In
 most
 countries,
 legal

 concerns
 about
 the
safety
 of
 healthcare
 providers
 involved
 in
 the
 care
 of
 cardiac
 arrest
patients.
 When
 attempting
 CPR
 in
 infectious
 patients
 healthcare
professionals
 must
 use
 proper
 protective
 equipment
 and
 be
 sufﬁ-
ciently
 trained
 in
 its
 use.995,996
Organ
 donation
The
 primary
 goal
 of
 resuscitation
 is
 to
 save
 the
 patient’s
 life.997
Nonetheless,
 resuscitation
 efforts
 may
 result
 in
 brain
 death.
 In
 these
cases,
 the
 aim
 of
 resuscitation
 could
 change
 to
 the
 preservation
 of
organs
 for
 possible
 donation.998 The
 duty
 of
 resuscitation
 teams
 for
the
 living
 patient
 should
 not
 be
 confused
 with
 the
 duty
 of
 physi-
cians
 for
 the
 dead
 donors,
 where
 the
 organs
 are
 preserved
 to
 save
other
 people’s
 lives.
 All
 European
 countries
 should
 enhance
 their
efforts
 to
 maximise
 the
 possibility
 of
 organ
 donation
 from
 cardiac
arrest
 patients
 who
 became
 brain
 dead
 or
 after
 stopping
 resuscita-
tion
 in
 case
 of
 CPR
 failure.999
Variability
 in
 ethical
 CPR
 practices
 in
 Europe
Representatives
 of
 32
 European
 countries
 where
 the
 activities
 of
the
 European
 Resuscitation
 Council
 are
 organised,
 have
 responded
to
 questions
 regarding
 local
 ethical
 legislation
 and
 practice
 of
resuscitation,
 and
 organisation
 of
 out-of-hospital
 and
 in-hospital
resuscitation
 services.
 Equal
 access
 to
 emergency
 care
 and
 to
 early
deﬁbrillation
 is
 now
 well
 established.
 The
 principle
 of
 patient
autonomy
 is
 now
 legally
 supported
 in
 the
 majority
 of
 countries.
However
 in
 less
 than
 half
 the
 countries
 are
 family
 members
 usu-
ally
 allowed
 to
 be
 present
 during
 CPR.
 At
 this
 time
 euthanasia
and
 physician-assisted
 suicide
 are
 controversial
 subjects
 in
 many
European
 countries
 and
 the
 discussion
 is
 ongoing
 in
 several
 Euro-
pean
 countries.
 Healthcare
 professionals
 should
 know
 and
 apply
the
 established
 national
 and
 local
 legislation
 and
 policies.
Family
 presence
 during
 resuscitation
The
 ERC
 supports
 relatives
 being
 offered
 the
 choice
 of
 being
present
 during
 a
 resuscitation
 attempt
 whilst
 cultural
 and
 social
variations
 must
 be
 understood
 and
 appreciated
 with
 sensitiv-
ity.
 DNAR
 decisions
 and
 discussions
 relating
 to
 DNAR
 should
 be
recorded
 clearly
 in
 the
 patient’s
 notes.1001–1004 Over
 time
 the
 situ-
ation
 or
 the
 perspectives
 of
 patients
 might
 change
 and
 DNAR
 orders
should
 be
 revised
 accordingly.1005
Training
 health
 care
 professionals
 about
 DNAR
 issues
Healthcare
 professionals
 should
 receive
 training
 about
 the
 legal
and
 ethical
 basis
 of
 DNAR
 decisions
 and
 about
 how
 to
 communicate
effectively
 with
 patients,
 relatives
 or
 next
 of
 kin.
 Quality
 of
 life,
supportive
 care
 and
 end-of-life
 decisions
 need
 to
 be
 explained
 as
an
 integrative
 part
 of
 the
 medical
 and
 nursing
 practice.1006
Practicing
 procedures
 on
 the
 recently
 dead
As
 there
 is
 wide
 diversity
 in
 opinion
 about
 practicing
 procedures
on
 the
 recently
 dead,
 healthcare
 students
 and
 teaching
 profession-
als
 are
 advised
 to
 learn
 and
 follow
 the
 established
 legal,
 regional
and
 local
 hospital
 policies.
Research
 and
 informed
 consent
Research
 in
 the
 ﬁeld
 of
 resuscitation
 is
 necessary
 to
 test
 com-
monly
 interventions
 with
 uncertain
 efﬁcacy
 or
 new
 potentially
beneﬁcial
 treatments.1007,1008 To
 include
 participants
 in
 a
 study,
informed
 consent
 must
 be
 obtained.
 In
 emergencies,
 there
 is
often
 insufﬁcient
 time
 to
 obtain
 informed
 consent.
 Deferred
 con-
sent
 or
 exception
 to
 informed
 consent
 with
 prior
 community
consultation,
 are
 considered
 ethically
 acceptable
 alternatives
 for
respecting
 autonomy.1009,1010 Following
 12
 years
 of
 ambiguity,
 a
new
 European
 Union
 (EU)
 Regulation
 permitting
 deferred
 consent
is
 expected
 to
 harmonise
 and
 foster
 emergency
 research
 across
Member
 States.1008,1009,1011,1012
Audit
 of
 in-hospital
 cardiac
 arrests
 and
 registry
 analyses
Local
 CPR
 management
 can
 be
 improved
 through
 post-CPR
debrieﬁng
 to
 ensure
 a
 PDCA
 (plan-do-check-act)
 circle
 of
 qual-
ity
 improvement.
 Debrieﬁng
 enables
 identiﬁcation
 of
 CPR
 quality
errors
 and
 prevents
 their
 repetition.939,961,1013 Resuscitation
