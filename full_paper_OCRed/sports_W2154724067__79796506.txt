ABSTRACT 
We analyzed transaction logs containing 51,473 queries posed by 18,113 users of Excite, a 
major Internet search service. We provide data on: (i) sessions - changes in queries during a 
session, number of pages viewed, and use of relevance feedback, (ii) queries - the number of 
search terms, and the use of  logic and modifiers, and (iii) terms - their rank/frequency 
distribution and the most highly used search terms. We then shift the focus of analysis from the 
query to the user to gain insight to the characteristics of the Web user. With these 
characteristics as a basis, we then conducted a failure analysis, identifying trends among user 
mistakes. We conclude with a summary of findings and a discussion of the implications of these 
findings. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
A panel session at the 1997 ACM Special Interest Group on Research Issues In 
Information  
Retrieval conference entitled “Real Life Information Retrieval: Commercial Search Engines” 
included representatives from several Internet search services. Doug Cutting represented 
Excite, one of the major services. Graciously, he offered to make available a set of user queries 
as submitted to his service for research. The analysis we present here on the nature of 
sessions, queries, and terms resulted from this offer. Interestingly, the authors expressed their 
interest independently of each other, then met via email, exchanged messages and data, and 
conducted collaborative research exclusively through the Internet, before ever meeting in 
person at a Rutgers conference in February 1998, when the results were first presented. In 
itself, this is an example of how the Internet changed and is changing the conduct of research.   
We will argue in the conclusions that real life Internet searching is changing information 
retrieval (IR) as well. While Internet search engines are based on IR principles, Internet 
searching is very different from IR searching as traditionally practiced and researched in online

databases, CD-ROMs and online public access catalogs (OPACS). Internet IR is a different IR, 
with a number of implications that could portend changes in other areas of IR as well. 
With the phenomenal increase in usage of the Web, there has been a growing interest in 
the study of a variety of topics and issues related to use of the Web. For instance, on the 
hardware side, Crovella and Besravros (1996) studied client-side traffic; and Abdulla, et al., 
(1997) analyzed server usage. On the software side, there have been many descriptive 
evaluations of Web search engines (e.g. Lynch, 1997).  Statistics of Web use appear regularly 
(e.g., Kehoe, et al., 1997; FIND/SVP, 1997), but as soon as they appear, they are out of date. 
The coverage of various Web search engine services was analyzed in several works. A recent 
article on this topic by Lawrence and Giles (1998) attracted a lot of attention. The pattern of 
Web surfing by users was analyzed as well (Huberman, et al., 1998). However, to date there 
has been no large-scale, quantitative or qualitative study of Web searching.  
How do they search the Web? What do they search for on the Web?  These questions 
are addressed in a large scale and academic manner in this study. Given the recent yearly 
exponential increase in the estimated number of Web users, this lack of scholarly research is 
surprising and disappointing. In contrast, there have been an abundance of user studies of on-
line public access categories (OPAC) users. Many of these studies are reviewed in Peters 
(1997). Similarly, there are numerous studies of users of traditional IR systems. The combined 
proceedings of the International Conference on Research Issues in Information Retrieval (ACM 
SIGIR) present many of these studies.  
In the area of Web users, however, there were only two narrow studies that we could 
find. One focused on the THOMAS system (Croft, Cook & Wilder, 1995) and contained some 
general information about users at that site. However, this study focused exclusively on the 
THOMAS Web site, did not attempt to characterize Web searching in a systematic way, and is 
devoted primarily to a description of the THOMAS system. The second paper was by Jones, 
Cunningham, and McNab (1998) and focused again on a single Web site, the New Zealand

Digital Library, which contains computer science technical reports. Given the technical nature of 
this site, it is questionable whether these users represent Web users in general. There is a 
small but growing body of Web user studies compared to the numerous studies of OPAC and IR 
system use.  
 
In this paper, we report results from a major and ongoing study of users’ searching 
behavior on the Web. We examined a set of transaction logs of users’ searches from Excite 
(http://www.excite.com). This study involved real users, using real queries, with real information 
needs, using a real search engine. The strength of this study is that it involved a real slice of life 
on the Web. The weakness is that it involved only a slice – an observable artifact of what the 
users actually did, without any information about the users themselves or about the results and 
uses. Users are anonymous, but we can identify one or a sequence of queries originating with a 
specific user. We know when they searched and what they searched for, but we do not know 
anything beyond that. We report on artifactual behavior, but without a context. However, the 
observation and analysis of such behavior provide for a fascinating and surprising insight into 
the interaction between users and the search engines on the Web. More importantly, this study 
provides detailed statistics currently lacking on Web user behavior. It also provides a basis for 
comparison with similar studies of user searching of more traditional IR and OPAC systems. 
The Web has a number of search engines. The approaches to searching, including 
algorithms, displays, modes of interaction and so on, vary from one search engine to another. 
Still, all Web search engines are IR tools for searching highly diverse and distributed information 
resources as found on the Web. But by the nature of the Web resources, they are faced with 
different issues requiring different solutions than the search engines found in well organized 
systems, such as in DIALOG, or in lab experiments, such as in the Text Retrieval Conference 
(TREC) (Sparck Jones, 1995). Moreover, from all that we know, Web users spans a vastly 
broader and thus probably different population of users (Spink, Bateman & Jansen, 1998) and 
information needs, which may greatly affect the queries, searches, and interactions. Thus, it is

----- Page 6 (native) -----

of considerable interest to examine the similarities and/or differences in Web searching 
compared to traditional IR systems. In either case, it is potentially a very different IR.  
 
The significance of this study is the same as all other related studies of IR interaction, 
queries and searching. By axiom and from lessons learned from experience and numerous 
studies:  
“The success or failure of any interactive system and technology is contingent on 
the extent to which user issues, the human factors, are addressed right from the 
beginning to the very end, right from theory, conceptualization, and design 
process to development, evaluation, and to provision of services” (Saracevic, 
1997). 
 
RELATED IR STUDIES  
In this paper, we concentrate on users’ sessions, queries, and terms as key variables in 
IR interaction on the Web. While there are many papers that discuss many aspects of Web 
searching, most of those are descriptive, prescriptive, or commentary. Other than the two 
mentioned previously, we could not find any similar studies of Web searching. However, there 
were several studies that included data on searching of existing, mostly commercial, IR 
systems, and we culled data from those to provide a basis for comparison between searches as 
done on the Web and those as done on IR systems outside the Web. A representative sample 
of such studies is reviewed.  
 
The studies cited below concentrated on different aspects and variables related to 
searching, using different methodologies and are difficult to compare. Still, each of them had 
data on the mean number of search terms in queries constructed by the searchers under study 
as follows: 
• 
Fenichel (1981): Novice searchers: 7.9. Moderately experienced: 9.6. Experienced: 
14.4

Hsieh-yee (1993): Familiar topics: Novices: 8.77. Experienced: 7.28. Non-familiar

• 
Bates (1993): Humanities scholars: 14.95 
• 
Spink & Saracevic (1997): Experienced searchers: 14.8. 
 
The studies indicated that searches by various populations contain a range of some 7 to 15 
terms. As will be discussed below, this is a considerably higher range than the mean number of 
terms found in this study that concentrated on Web searches from the Excite search engine. 
 
BACKGROUND ON EXCITE AND DATA 
Founded in 1994, Excite, Inc. is a major Internet media public company which offers free 
Web searching and a variety of other services. The company and its services are described at 
its Web site (http://www.excite.com), thus not repeated here. Only the search capabilities 
relevant to out results are summarized. 
Excite searches are based on the exact terms that a user enters in the query, however, 
capitalization is disregarded, with the exception of logical commands AND, OR, and AND NOT. 
Stemming is not available. An online thesaurus and concept linking method called Intelligent 
Concept Extraction (ICE) is used, to find related terms in addition to terms entered. Search 
results are provided in ranked relevance order.  A number of advanced search features are 
available. Those that pertain to our results are described here: 
• 
As to search logic, Boolean operators AND, OR, AND NOT, and parentheses can be 
used, but these operators must appear in ALL CAPS and with a space on each side. 
When using Boolean operator ICE (concept-based search mechanism) is turned off. 
• 
A set of terms enclosed in quotation marks (no space between quotation marks and 
terms) returns web sites with the terms as a phrase in the exact order they were 
entered. 
• 
A + (plus) sign before a term (no space) requires that the term must be in an answer.

----- Page 8 (native) -----
7
• 
A – (minus) sign before a term (no space) requires that the term must NOT be in an 
answer.  We denote plus and minus signs, and quotation marks, as modifiers. 
• 
A page of search results contains ten answers at a time ranked as to relevance. For 
each site provided is the title, URL (Web site address), and a summary of its 
contents. Results can also be displayed by site and titles only. A user can click on 
the title to go to the Web site. A user can also click for the next page of ten answers. 
In addition, there is a clickable option More Like This, which is a relevance feedback 
mechanism to find similar sites. 
• 
When More Like This is clicked, Excite enters and counts this as a query with zero 
terms.  
Each transaction record contained three fields. With these three fields, we were able to 
locate a user's initial query and recreate the chronological series of actions by each user in a 
session: 
1. Time of Day: measured in hours, minutes, and seconds from midnight of 9 March 
1997. 
2. User Identification: an anonymous user code assigned by the Excite server. 
3. Query Terms: exactly as entered by the given user.  
Focusing on our three levels of analysis - sessions, queries, and terms - we defined our 
variables in the following way.   
1. Session:  A session is the entire series of queries by a user over a number of 
minutes or hours. A session could be as short as one query or contain many queries.   
2. Query:  A query consists of one or more search terms, and possibly includes logical 
operators and modifiers.   
3. Term: A term is any unbroken string of characters (i.e. a  series of characters with no 
space between any of the characters). The characters in terms included everything –

letters, numbers, and symbols. Terms were words, abbreviations, numbers, symbols, 
URLs, and any combination thereof. We counted logical operators in capitals as 
terms. However, in a separate analysis we isolated them as commands, not terms.   
The raw data collected are very messy. Users entered terms, commands and modifiers 
in all kinds of ways, including many misspellings and mistakes. In many cases, Excite 
conventions were not followed.  We count these deviations as mistakes and report them in the 
failure analysis portion of the paper. For the most part, we took the data ‘as is,’ i.e., we did not 
‘clean’ the data in any way – these queries represent real searches by real users. The only 
normalization we undertook in one of the counts (unique terms - not case sensitive) was to 
disregard capitalization, because Excite disregards it as well. (i.e. TOPIC, topic and Topic 
retrieve the same answers). Excite does not offer automatic stemming, thus topic and topics 
count as two unique terms, and ‘?’ or ‘*’ as stemming commands at the end of terms are 
mistakes, but when used counted as separate terms. We also analyzed a cleaned set of terms, 
that is we removed term modifiers such as the + or – signs. We took great care in derivation of 
counts due to the ‘messiness’ of data. This paper extends findings from (Jansen, et al., 1998a, 
b, c). 
 
RESULTS 
First, what is the pattern of user queries?  We looked at the number of queries by each 
specific user and how successive queries differed from other queries by the same user. We 
classified the 51,474 queries as to unique, modified, or identical as shown in Table 1.  
[INSERT TABLE 1 HERE] 
A unique query was the first query by a user (this represents the number of users). A 
modified query is a subsequent query in succession (second, third …) by the same user with 
terms added to, removed from, or both added to and removed from the unique query. Unique 
and modified queries together represent those queries where the user did something with terms.

Identical queries are queries by the same user that are identical to the query preceding it. They 
can come about in two ways. The first possibility is that the user retyped the query. Studies 
have shown that users often do this (Peters, 1997). The second possibility is that the query was 
generated by Excite. When a user views the second and further pages (i.e., a page is a group of 
10 results) of results from the same query, Excite provides another query, but a query that is 
identical to the preceding one. Our analysis did not allow disambiguation of these two causes of 
identical queries. 
The unique plus modified queries (where users actively entered or modified terms) 
amounted to 29,437 queries or 57% of all queries. If we assume that all identical queries were 
generated as request for viewing subsequent pages, then 43% of queries come as a result of 
desire to view more pages after the first one. Modifications and viewing are further elaborated in 
the next two tables. 
 
Modifications 
Some users used only one query in their session, others used a number of successive 
queries. The average session, including all three query types, was 2.84 queries per session. 
This means that a number of users went on to either modify their query, view subsequent 
results, or both. The average session length, ignoring identical queries, was 1.6 queries per 
user. Table 2 lists the number of queries per user.  
[INSERT TABLE 2 HERE] 
This analysis includes only the 29,337 unique and modified queries. We ignored the 
identical queries because as stated above, it was impossible to interpret them meaningfully in 
this context, in order to concentrate only on those queries where users themselves did 
something to the queries. A substantial majority of users (67%) did not go beyond their first and 
only query. Query modification was not a typical occurrence. This finding is contrary to 
experiences in searching regular IR systems, where modification of queries is much more

----- Page 11 (native) -----
10
common. Having said this, however, 33% of the users did go beyond their first query. 
Approximately 14% of users had entered three or more queries. These percentages of 33% and 
14% are not insignificant proportions of system users. It suggests that a substantial percentage 
of Web users do not fit the stereotypical naïve Web user. These sub-populations of users 
should receive further study. They could represent sub-populations of Web users with more 
experience or higher motivation who perform query modification on the Web.  
We also examined how user modified their queries. These results are display in Table 3.  
[INSERT TABLE 3 HERE] 
Here we concentrate on the 11,249 queries that were modified by either an increase or a 
decrease in the number of terms from one user's query to that user’s next query (i.e., 
successive queries by the same user at time T and T+1). Zero change means that the user 
modified one or more terms in a query, but did not change the number of terms in the 
successive query. Increase or decrease of one means that one term was added to or subtracted 
from the preceding query. Percent is based on the number of queries in relation to all modified 
(11,249) queries.  
We can see that users typically do not add or delete much in respect to the number of 
terms in their successive queries. Modifications to queries are done in small increments, if at all. 
The most common modification is to change a term. This number is reflected in the queries with 
zero (0) increase or decrease in terms. About one in every three queries that is modified still 
had the same number of terms as the preceding one. In the remaining 7,338 successive queries 
where terms were either added or subtracted about equal number had terms added as 
subtracted (52 to 48%)  - thus users go both ways in increasing and decreasing number of 
terms in queries. About one in five queries that is modified has one more term than the 
preceding one, and about one in six has one less term.

----- Page 12 (native) -----
11
Viewing of Results 
Excite displays query results in groups of ten. Each time that a user accesses another 
group of 10, which we term another page, an identical query is generated. We analyzed the 
number of pages each user viewed and the percentage that this represented based on the total 
number of users. The results are shown in Table 4.  
[INSERT TABLE 4 HERE] 
The mean number of pages examined per user was 2.35. Most users,  58% of them, did 
not access any results past the first page. Were they so satisfied with the results that they did 
not need to view more?  Were a few answers were good enough?  Is the precision that high? 
Are the users after precision? Or did they just give up and get tired of viewing results? Using 
only transaction logs, we cannot provide answers to these questions. But in any case, this result 
combined with the small number of queries per session has interesting implications for recall 
and may illustrate a need for high precision in Web IR algorithms. For example, using a 
classical measurement of precision, any search result beyond the tenth position in the list would 
be meaningless for 58% of Web users. Another possible interpretation is that people use 
partially relevant items in the first page to avoid further searching through subsequent pages. 
Given the hypertext nature of the Web, partially relevant items (Spink, Greisdorf & Bateman, 
1998) in the top ten maybe used as a jumping off point to find a relevant items. For example, a 
user looking for a faculty member’s homepage at a university does not retrieve the faculty’s 
homepage in the top ten but gets the university homepage. Rather than continue search engine 
via the searching, the user starts browsing beginning with the university page. 
 
Queries 
From the session level of analysis, we then moved to the query level. The basic statistics 
related to queries and search terms are given in Table 5.

----- Page 13 (native) -----
12
[INSERT TABLE 5 HERE] 
 
We analyzed queries based on length (i.e., number of terms), structure (use of Boolean 
operators and modifiers), and failure analysis (deviations from published rules of query 
construction). We also identified the number of users of Boolean logic and modifiers.   
Length 
On the average, a query contained 2.21 terms. Table 6 shows the ranking of all queries 
by number of terms.  
[INSERT TABLE 6 HERE] 
Percent is the percentage of queries containing that number of terms relative to the total 
number of queries. Web queries are short. About 62% of all queries contained one or two terms. 
Fewer than 4% of the queries had more than 6 terms. As mentioned, we could not find any 
other data on Web searches from a major Web search engine, thus, the only comparisons are 
with the two smaller studies by Croft, Cook, and Wilder (1995) and Jones, Cunningham, and 
McNab (1998). The query length observed in our research is similar to results from these two 
studies. This deviates significantly from traditional IR searching. As  shown above, the mean 
number of search terms in searching of regular IR systems ranged from about 7 to 15. This is 
about three to seven times higher than found in this study, and our count is on the high side, 
because we counted operators as well. Admittedly, the circumstances and context between 
searches done by users of IR systems such as DIALOG and searches of the Web done by the 
general Internet population may be vastly different, thus this comparison may have little 
meaning.  
Relevance Feedback 
A note should be made on queries with zero terms (last row of Table 6). As mentioned, 
when a user enters a command for relevance feedback (More Like This), the Excite transaction 
log counts that as a query, but a query with zero terms. Thus, the last row represents the largest

----- Page 14 (native) -----
13
possible number of queries that used relevance feedback, or a combination of those and 
queries where user made some mistake that triggered this result. Assuming they were all 
relevance feedback, only 5% of queries used that feature – a small use of relevance feedback 
capability. In comparison, a study involving IR searches conducted by professional searchers as 
they interact with users found that some 11% of search terms came from relevance feedback 
(Spink & Saracevic, 1997), albeit this study looked at human initiated relevance feedback. Thus, 
in these two studies, relevance feedback on the Web is used half as much as in traditional IR 
searches.  This in itself warrants further study, particularly given the low use of this potentially 
highly useful and certainly highly vaunted feature. 
Structure 
Next, we examined the structure of queries, focusing first on how many of the 51,473 
queries explicitly utilized Boolean operators or modifiers (see Table 7).   
[INSERT TABLE 7 HERE] 
The Number column lists the number of queries that contained that particular Boolean 
operator or modifier. The next column is the percentage that number represents of all queries. 
Incorrect means the number of queries containing a specific operator or modifier that was 
constructed not following Excite rules – they could be considered as mistakes. The last column 
is the percentage of queries containing a given operator or modifier that were incorrectly 
constructed. We discuss the failures in a later section. 
From Table 7, at least one thing is obvious – Boolean operators were not used much, 
with AND receiving the greatest use. These numbers were significantly lower than those 
reported by Jones, Cunningham, and McNab (1998), and significantly lower than studies of 
searches from IR systems and OPAC systems (Croft, Cook & Wilder (1995) did not report this 
information). Modifiers were used a little more often, with the ‘+’ and “” (i.e., phrase searching) 
being used the most. For example, based on what we reviewed so far in this paper, we have a

----- Page 15 (native) -----
14
large set of queries that are extremely short, seldom modified, and very simple in structure. Yet, 
the vast majority of users never viewed anything beyond the first 10 results. Is the recall and 
precision rate of Excite that good?  Is something else at work here? One interpretation may be 
that users only glance at the first page to see how poorly they performed their search. Rather 
than taking time to learn the detailed procedures of Excite, they try anything (trial and error) and 
then try to judge from the hits what they did wrong. 
Number of Users 
In Table 8, we examine how many of the 18,113 users, opposed to the number of 
queries, used any Boolean logic (first four rows) or modifiers (last three rows) in their queries 
(regardless of how many queries they had).   
[INSERT TABLE 8 HERE] 
We relate these numbers to the number of queries. Incorrect means the number of users 
committing mistakes by not following Excite rules as stated in instructions for use of these 
operators and modifiers.  Percent incorrect is proportion of those users using a given operator 
or modifier incorrectly or as a mistake. 
The user population that incorporated Boolean operators was very small. Only 6% of the 18,113 
users used any of the Boolean capabilities, and these were used in less than 10% of the 51,473 
queries. A minuscule percentage of users and queries used OR or AND NOT. Only about 1% of 
users and ½% of queries used nested logic as expressed by a use of parentheses. The ‘+’ and 
‘-‘ modifiers were used by about the same number of people that used Boolean operators. 
Together ‘+’ and ‘-‘ were used by 1,334 or 7% of users in 4,776 (9%) queries. The ability to 
create phrases (terms enclosed by quotation marks) was also seldom used – only 6% of users 
and 6% of queries used them. From this, it appears that a small number of users account for the 
occurrences of the more sophisticated queries, indicating that there is little experimentation by 
users during their sessions. About 5% of the users account for the 8.5% of queries that

----- Page 16 (native) -----
15
contained Boolean operators. We discuss the ramifications of this finding for system design 
later in the paper. 
 
FAILURE ANALYSIS 
Next, we turn to a discussion of the surprisingly high number of incorrect uses or 
mistakes. When they used it, 50% of users made a mistake in the use of the Boolean AND; 28% 
made an error in uses of OR, and only 19% used AND NOT incorrectly, but only 47 users, a 
negligible percent, used AND NOT at all. The most common mistake was not capitalizing the 
Boolean operator, as required by the Excite search engine. For example, a correct query would 
be: information AND processing. The most common mistake would be: information and 
processing. 
 
When we look at queries, 32% contained an incorrect use of AND, 26% of OR, and 37% 
of AND NOT.  ‘AND’ presents a special problem, so we did a further analysis. We had 4,094 
queries that used AND in some form (as ‘AND,’ “And, or ‘and’). Some queries had more than 
one AND. Altogether, there were 4,828 appearances of all forms of AND: 3,067 as ‘AND’, 41 as 
‘And,’ and 1,720 as ‘and.’ If considered as Boolean operators, the last two or 1,761 instances 
were mistakes. Most of them were, but not all. In a number of queries ‘and’ was used as 
conjunction e.g. as in query College and university harassment policy.  Unfortunately, we could 
not distinguish the intended use of ‘and’ as a conjunction from that as a mistake, thus our count 
of AND mistakes is on the high end.   
There was a similarly high percentage of mistakes in the use of plus and minus 
operators – respectively 30% and 38%. Most of the time, spaces were used incorrectly. Minus 
presents an especially vexing problem, because it is also used in phrases such as pre-teen. 
Thus, our count of mistakes is at the high end. It is easy to see that Web users are not up to 
Boolean, and even less to follow searching rules. At the very least, system redesign seems to 
be in order. The most common mistake was stringing all the terms of the query together, as in a

----- Page 17 (native) -----
16
mathematical formula. For example, a correct query would be: +information +processing. The 
most common mistake would be: +information+processing (with no space between information 
and the next +). Consistent spacing rules between Boolean operators and term modifier may 
solve this problem. In the use of Boolean operator, a space between the operator and the term 
is required. With the use of term modifiers, the space must not be there. 
There were also a large number of queries that incorporated searching techniques that 
Excite does not support. These failures can be classified as carry over from user learning 
associated with other search engines, including those from other Web, OPAC, and IR systems. 
For example, there were 26 occurrences of the proximity operator NEAR. There were 79 uses 
of the ‘:’ as a separator for terms. There were numerous occurrences of ‘.’ used as a term 
separator. The symbol ‘&’ was used in-lieu of the Boolean AND over 200 times. These symbols 
are common in many other search engines. 
 
TERMS 
We also analyzed user queries according to the terms they included. A term was any 
series of characters bounded by white space. There were 113,793 terms (all terms from all 
queries). After eliminating duplicate terms, there were 21,862 unique terms that were non-case 
sensitive (in other words, all upper cases are here reduced to lower case). In this distribution 
logical operators AND, OR, NOT were also treated as terms, because they were used not only 
as operators but also as conjunctions (we already discussed the case of ‘and.’ and presented 
the figures for various forms of the term, thus subtraction can be easily done). We discuss terms 
from the perspective of their occurrence, their fit with known distributions, and classification into 
some broader subject headings.

----- Page 18 (native) -----
17
Occurrences 
We constructed a complete rank-frequency table for all 113,793 terms. Out of the 
complete rank-frequency-table we took the top terms, i.e., those that appeared 100 times or 
more, as presented in Table 9. 
[INSERT TABLE 9 HERE] 
The 74 terms that were used 100 or more times across all queries appeared a total of 
20,698 times as search terms. They represent only 0.34 % of all unique terms, yet they account 
for 18.2 % of all 113,776 search terms in all queries. If we delete the 9,121 occurrences of 11 
common terms that do not carry any content by themselves (and, of, the, in, for, +, on, to, or, &, 
a), we are left with 63 subject terms that have a total frequency of 11,577 occurrences – that is 
0.29% of unique subject terms account for 10.3% of all terms in all queries. The high 
appearance of ‘+’ represents a probable mistake – the inclusion of space between the sign and 
a term, as required by Excite rules.  
Similarly, ‘&” was used often as a part of an abbreviation, such as in AT&T, but also as a 
substitute for logical AND, as in Ontario & map. In the latter case, it is a mistake and would 
appear as a separate term. On the other end of the distribution we have 9,790 terms that 
appeared only once. These terms amounted to 44.78% of all unique terms and 8.6% of all terms 
in all queries. The tail end of unique terms is very long and warrants in itself a linguistic 
investigation. In fact, the whole area of query language needs further investigation. There are 
no comprehensive studies of terms, the distribution of those terms, the modification of those 
terms, etc., of Web queries. Such studies have potential to benefit IR system and Web site 
development.

Term Categories 
In order to ascertain some broad subjects of searching, we classified the 63 top subject 
terms into a set of common themes. Admittedly, such a classification is arbitrary and each 
reader can use his/her own criteria. Still a rough picture emerges. These subjects are displayed 
in Table 10.   
[INSERT TABLE 10 HERE] 
 
About 25% of the highest used terms apparently dealt with some or other sexual topic. 
However, that represents fewer than 3% of all terms. Of course, if one classifies additional 
terms further down the distribution (such as those listed in the “Gender” category as Sexual) the 
percent will be higher. We perused the rest of the terms and came to the conclusion than no 
more than some two dozen of the other terms will unmistakably fall into that category. If we 
added them all together, the frequency of terms in Sexual will increase but not that much, and 
particularly not in relation to thousands of terms in other categories that are widely spread 
across all frequencies. In other words, as to frequency of appearance of terms among the 63 
highest frequency terms those in category Sexual have highest frequency of all categories, but 
still three out of every four terms of 63 highest frequency terms are not sexual; if extended to the 
frequency of use of all terms we estimate that 39 out of 40 of all terms were not sexual.  
While the category Sexual is certainly big, in comparison to all other categories in no 
way does it dominate searching. Interest in other categories is high. Of the 63 highest terms, 
16% are modifiers (free, new, big…), 10% deal with places (state, american …), 8% with 
economics (employment, jobs …),  and the rest with  social activities, education, sports, 
computing, and arts. In other words, Web searching does cover a gamut of human interests. It 
is very diverse. In light of this, the stereotypical view of the Web user searching primarily for 
sexual information may not be valid.

There are two other groupings not listed in the table that should be noted. First, there 
were 1,398 queries for various uniform resource locators (URL). Although no one URL made the 
top of the list, if lumped together as a category, it was one of, if not the largest query category. 
The second group was searching for multimedia documents (e.g., images, videos, and audio 
files). There were 708 queries for these multimedia files, with many of the terms looking for 
specific formats. 
 
Distribution of Terms 
We constructed a graph of rank – frequency distribution of all terms. This graph is shown 
in Figure 1.   
[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE] 
The resulting distribution seems to be unbalanced at the ends of the graph, the high and 
low ranking terms. In the center and lower regions, the graph follows the traditional slope of a 
Zipf distribution representing the distribution of words in long English texts. At the beginning, it 
falls off very gently, and toward the end it shows discontinuities and an unusually long tail, 
representing terms with a frequency of one. A trend line is plotted on the figure with the 
corresponding equation. The trend line is approximately that of the Zipf distribution. A proper 
Zipf distribution would be a straight line with slope of –1. The trend line does not plot well for the 
higher frequency terms due to the large number of terms occurring only once or twice.  
We wondered if the number of modifiers (e.g., ‘+’, ‘-‘, “, etc.) and the number of queries 
with all terms strung together (e.g., +information+processing+journal) could be affecting the 
rank – frequency distribution, that is, if the number of modifiers, stray characters, and run-on 
terms, were creating such a long tail of single occurrence terms. Therefore, we decided to clean 
all terms and re-plot the rank – frequency graph. In cleaning terms, we removed all modifiers 
and separated all terms that were obviously strung together. Due to the varying nature of the

----- Page 21 (native) -----
20
terms, this could not be done automatically. For example, one could not just remove ‘+’ from all 
terms because, for example, with c++ (the programming language), the ‘+’ is part of a valid 
term. In the cleaning process, all 113,793 terms were qualitatively examined.  In most cases, a 
decision would clearly be made on whether or not to clean the term. In cases were there was 
doubt, the term was not modified. Once clean, we again generated a rank –frequency (log) plot. 
This rank – frequency plot is shown in Figure 2. 
[INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE] 
Overall, the graph exhibits the same characteristics as before, a few terms off the scale, 
a fairly broad middle, ending with of several plateaus: and a long tail of terms used only one 
time. The only noticeable change is in the length of the plateaus, some are shorter and some 
are longer. The trend line again is approximately that of the Zipf distribution, with only a slight 
increase in slope. Again, the tails of the graph in no way resemble a Zipf distribution. This 
warrants further study of the ends of the rank – frequency distribution. Also, for researchers, this 
shows that there is little benefit in expending the energy to clean terms, as the change in the 
distribution is slight. A comparison of the original and the cleaned data appears in Table 11.  
[INSERT TABLE 11 HERE] 
Figure 3 is the original and cleaned rank – frequency (log) plots overlaid along with the 
trend lines.

Summary of Results 
The analysis involved 51,473 queries from 18,113 users, having all together 113,776 
terms, of which 21,862 were unique terms (disregarding capitalization). We provide the 
highlights of our findings:

----- Page 22 (native) -----
21
• 
Most users did not have many queries per search. The mean number of queries per user 
was 2.8. However, a sizable percentage of users did go on to either modify their original 
query or view subsequent results. 
• 
Web queries are short. On the average, a query contained 2.21 terms. Queries in 
searching of regular IR systems are some three to seven times larger. About one in 
three queries had one term only, two in three had one or two terms, and four in five had 
one, two or three terms. Fewer than 4% of the queries were comprised of more than 6 
terms.  
• 
Relevance feedback was rarely used. About one in 20 queries used the feature More 
Like This. In comparison with professionally assisted IR searching, relevance feedback 
is apparently used only half as much on the Web.  
• 
Boolean operators were seldom used. One in 18 users used any Boolean capabilities, 
and of the users employing them, every second user made a mistake, as defined by 
Excite rules. As to the queries, about one in 12 queries contained a Boolean operator, 
and in those AND was used by far the most. About one in 190 queries used nested logic. 
About one in every three queries that used Boolean operators or a parentheses did not 
enter them as required by Excite. Web searchers are reluctant to use Boolean searches 
and when using them they have great difficulty in getting them right. 
• 
The ‘+’ and ‘-‘ modifiers that specify the mandatory presence or absence of a term were 
used more than Boolean operators. About 1 in 12 users employed them. About one in 11 
queries incorporated a ‘+’ or ‘-‘ modifier. But a majority of these uses were mistakes 
(about two out of three).  
• 
The ability to create phrases (terms enclosed by quotation marks) was seldom , but 
correctly used – while only one in 16 queries contained a phrase, mistakes were 
negligible.

----- Page 23 (native) -----
22
• 
Most users searched one query only and did not follow with successive queries. The 
average session, ignoring identical queries, include 1.6 queries. About two in three users 
submitted a single query, and 6 in 7 did not go beyond two queries. 
• 
On average, users viewed 2.35 pages of results (where one page equals ten hits). Over 
half the users did not access result beyond the first page. More than three in four users 
did not go beyond viewing two pages 
• 
The distribution of the frequency of use of terms in queries was highly skewed. A few 
terms were used repeatedly and a lot of terms were used only once. On the top of the 
list, the 63 subject terms that had a frequency of appearance of 100 or more represented 
only one third of one percent of all terms, but they accounted for about one of every 10 
terms used in all queries. Terms that appeared only once amounted to half of the unique 
terms.   
• 
There is a lot of searching about sex on the Web, but all together it represents only a 
small proportion of all searches. When the top frequency terms are classified as to 
subject, the top category is Sexual. As to the frequency of appearance, about one in 
every four terms in the list of 63 highest used terms can be classified as sexual in 
nature. But while sexual terms are high as a category, they still represent a very small 
proportion of all terms. A great many other subjects are searched, and the diversity of 
subjects searched is very high. 
 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
We investigated a large sample of searches on the Web, represented by logs of queries 
from Excite, a major Web search provider. However, we consider this study as a starting point. 
We have begun the analysis of a new sample of over 1 million queries. We will compare the 
results from this study with those of the larger study to isolate similarities and/or differences. In

----- Page 24 (native) -----
23
this larger study, we will address many of the research questions raised in this paper. While 
Web search engines follow the basic principles of IR, Web search users seem to differ 
significantly from users of traditional IR systems, such as those represented by users of 
DIALOG or assumed (and highly artificial) users of TREC. It is still IR, but a very different IR. 
Web users are certainly not comfortable with Boolean operators and other advanced means of 
searching. They certainly do not frequently browse the results, beyond the first page or so. 
These facts in themselves emphasize the need to approach design of Web IR systems, search 
engines, and even Web site design in a significantly different way than the design of IR systems 
as practiced to date. They also point to the need for further and in-depth study of Web users. 
For instance: 
• 
The low use of advanced searching techniques would seem to support the continued 
research into new types of user interfaces, intelligent user interfaces, or the use of 
software agents to aid users in a much simplified and transparent manner. 
• 
The impact of a large number of unique terms on key term lists, thesauri, association 
methods, and latent semantic indexing deserves further investigation – the present 
methods are not attuned to the richness in the spread of terms. 
• 
The area of relevance feedback also deserves further investigation. Among others, 
the question of actual low use of this feature should be addressed in contrast to 
assumptions about high usefulness of this feature in IR research. If users use it so 
little, what is the impetus for testing relevance feedback in the present form? Users 
are voting with their fingers, but research is going the other way? 
• 
In itself, the work on investigation and classification of a large number of highly 
diverse queries presents a theoretical and methodological challenge. The impact of 
producing a more refined classification may be reflected in making browsing easier 
for users and precision possibly higher – both highly desirable features. Also,

----- Page 25 (native) -----
24
research into the language of Web queries would be of benefit to producers of 
information and data for Web users. 
Certainly, the Web is a marvelous new technology. The fact that the authors of this 
paper met and collaborated via the Web is an indication of the Web’s potential impact. People 
have always been unpredictable in how they will use any new technology. The impact that new 
technology has on existing systems is also unpredictable. It seems that this is the case with the 
Web as well. In the end, it all comes down to the users and the uses people make of the Web. 
Maybe they are searching the Web in ways that designers and IR researchers have not 
contemplated or assumed, as yet.
