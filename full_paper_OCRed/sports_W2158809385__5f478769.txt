was estimated to be around Rs. 22 billion (USD 0.5 billion), 
which is about 2% of the total world market. 
The pattern of pesticide usage in India is different from 
that for the world in general. As can be seen in Figure 1, 
in India 76% of the pesticide used is insecticide, as against 
44% globally (Mathur, 1999). The use of herbicides and 
fungicides is correspondingly less heavy. The main use of 
pesticides in India is for cotton crops (45%), followed by 
paddy and wheat. 
Benefi ts of pesticides
The primary benefits are the consequences of the pesti-
cides’ effects – the direct gains expected from their use. 
For example the effect of killing caterpillars feeding on the 
crop brings the primary benefit of higher yields and better 
quality of cabbage. The three main effects result in 26 pri-
mary benefits ranging from protection of recreational turf 
to saved human lives. The secondary benefits are the less 
immediate or less obvious benefits that result from the pri-
mary benefits. They may be subtle, less intuitively obvious, 
or of longer term. It follows that for secondary benefits it is 
therefore more difficult to establish cause and effect, but 
nevertheless they can be powerful justifications for pesticide 
use. For example the higher cabbage yield might bring addi-
tional revenue that could be put towards children’s educa-
tion or medical care, leading to a healthier, better educated 
population. There are various secondary benefits identi-
fied, ranging from fitter people to conserved biodiversity.
Improving productivity
Tremendous benefits have been derived from the use of 
pesticides in forestry, public health and the domestic sphere 
– and, of course, in agriculture, a sector upon which the 
Indian economy is largely dependent. Food grain produc-
tion, which stood at a mere 50 million tons in 1948–49, 
had increased almost fourfold to 198 million tons by the 
end of 1996–97 from an estimated 169 million hectares of 
Introduction
The term pesticide covers a wide range of compounds 
including insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides, 
molluscicides, nematicides, plant growth regulators and 
others. Among these, organochlorine (OC) insecticides, 
used successfully in controlling a number of diseases, such 
as malaria and typhus, were banned or restricted after the 
1960s in most of the technologically advanced countries. 
The introduction of other synthetic insecticides – organo-
phosphate (OP) insecticides in the 1960s, carbamates in 
1970s and pyrethroids in 1980s and the introduction of 
herbicides and fungicides in the 1970s–1980s contributed 
greatly to pest control and agricultural output. Ideally a 
pesticide must be lethal to the targeted pests, but not to 
non-target species, including man. Unfortunately, this is not 
the case, so the controversy of use and abuse of pesticides 
has surfaced. The rampant use of these chemicals, under 
the adage, “if little is good, a lot more will be better” has 
played havoc with human and other life forms.
Production and usage of pesticides in India
The production of pesticides started in India in 1952 with 
the establishment of a plant for the production of BHC near 
Calcutta, and India is now the second largest manufacturer 
of pesticides in Asia after China and ranks twelfth glob-
ally (Mathur, 1999). There has been a steady growth in 
the production of technical grade pesticides in India, from 
5,000 metric tons in 1958 to 102,240 metric tons in 1998. 
In 1996–97 the demand for pesticides in terms of value

permanently cropped land. This result has been achieved 
by the use of high-yield varieties of seeds, advanced irriga-
tion technologies and agricultural chemicals (Employment 
Information: Indian Labour Statistics, 1994). Similarly 
outputs and productivity have increased dramatically in 
most countries, for example wheat yields in the United 
Kingdom, corn yields in the USA. Increases in productivity 
have been due to several factors including use of fertiliser, 
better varieties and use of machinery. Pesticides have been 
an integral part of the process by reducing losses from the 
weeds, diseases and insect pests that can markedly reduce 
the amount of harvestable produce. Warren (1998) also 
drew attention to the spectacular increases in crop yields 
in the United States in the twentieth century. Webster et al. 
(1999) stated that “considerable economic losses” would be 
suffered without pesticide use and quantified the significant 
increases in yield and economic margin that result from 
pesticide use. Moreover, in the environment most pesticides 
undergo photochemical transformation to produce metabo-
lites which are relatively non-toxic to both human beings 
and the environment (Kole et al., 1999).
Protection of crop losses/yield reduction
In medium land, rice even under puddle conditions during 
the critical period warranted an effective and economic 
weed control practice to prevent reduction in rice yield due 
to weeds that ranged from 28 to 48%, based on comparisons 
that included control (weedy) plots (Behera and Singh, 1999). 
Weeds reduce yield of dry land crops (Behera and Singh, 
1999) by 37–79%. Severe infestation of weeds, particularly 
in the early stage of crop establishment, ultimately accounts 
for a yield reduction of 40%. Herbicides provided both an 
economic and labour benefit. 
Vector disease control
Vector-borne diseases are most effectively tackled by kill-
ing the vectors. Insecticides are often the only practical 
way to control the insects that spread deadly diseases such 
as malaria, resulting in an estimated 5000 deaths each day 
(Ross, 2005). In 2004, Bhatia wrote that malaria is one of the 
leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the developing 
world and a major public health problem in India. Disease 
control strategies are crucially important also for livestock.
Quality of food
In countries of the first world, it has been observed that a diet 
containing fresh fruit and vegetables far outweigh potential 
risks from eating very low residues of pesticides in crops 
(Brown, 2004). Increasing evidence (Dietary Guidelines, 
2005) shows that eating fruit and vegetables regularly 
reduces the risk of many cancers, high blood pressure, heart 
disease, diabetes, stroke, and other chronic diseases.
Lewis et al. (2005) discussed the nutritional properties of 
apples and blueberries in the US diet and concluded that their 
high concentrations of antioxidants act as protectants against 
cancer and heart disease. Lewis attributed doubling in wild 
blueberry production and subsequent increases in consump-
tion chiefly to herbicide use that improved weed control.
Other areas – transport, sport complex, building
The transport sector makes extensive use of pesticides, 
particularly herbicides. Herbicides and insecticides are 
used to maintain the turf on sports pitches, cricket grounds 
and golf courses. Insecticides protect buildings and other 
wooden structures from damage by termites and woodbor-
ing insects.

fibre, and amelioration of vector-borne diseases, then their 
debits have resulted in serious health implications to man 
and his environment. There is now overwhelming evidence 
that some of these chemicals do pose a potential risk to 
humans and other life forms and unwanted side effects to 
the environment (Forget, 1993; Igbedioh, 1991; Jeyaratnam, 
1981). No segment of the population is completely protected 
against exposure to pesticides and the potentially serious 
health effects, though a disproportionate burden, is shoul-
dered by the people of developing countries and by high 
risk groups in each country (WHO, 1990). The world-wide 
deaths and chronic diseases due to pesticide poisoning 
number about 1 million per year (Environews Forum, 1999).
The high risk groups exposed to pesticides include pro-
duction workers, formulators, sprayers, mixers, loaders and 
agricultural farm workers. During manufacture and formu-
lation, the possibility of hazards may be higher because the 
processes involved are not risk free. In industrial settings, 
workers are at increased risk since they handle various toxic 
chemicals including pesticides, raw materials, toxic solvents 
and inert carriers.
OC compounds could pollute the tissues of virtually 
every life form on the earth, the air, the lakes and the 
oceans, the fishes that live in them and the birds that feed 
on the fishes (Hurley et al., 1998). The US National Academy 
of Sciences stated that the DDT metabolite DDE causes 
eggshell thinning and that the bald eagle population in the 
United States declined primarily because of exposure to 
DDT and its metabolites (Liroff, 2000). Certain environ-
mental chemicals, including pesticides termed as endocrine 
disruptors, are known to elicit their adverse effects by 
mimicking or antagonising natural hormones in the body 
and it has been postulated that their long-term, low-dose 
exposure is increasingly linked to human health effects 
such as immune suppression, hormone disruption, dimin-
ished intelligence, reproductive abnormalities and cancer 
(Brouwer et al., 1999; Crisp et al., 1998; Hurley et al., 1998)
A study on workers (N=356) in four units manufacturing 
HCH in India revealed neurological symptoms (21%) which 
were related to the intensity of exposure (Nigam et al., 1993). 
The magnitude of the toxicity risk involved in the spraying of 
methomyl, a carbamate insecticide, in field conditions was 
assessed by the National Institute of Occupational Health 
(NIOH) (Saiyed et al., 1992). Significant changes were 
noticed in the ECG, the serum LDH levels, and cholineste-
rase (ChE) activities in the spraymen, indicating cardiotoxic 
effects of methomyl. Observations confined to health sur-
veillance in male formulators engaged in production of dust 
and liquid formulations of various pesticides (malathion, 
methyl parathion, DDT and lindane) in industrial settings 
of the unorganised sector revealed a high occurrence of 
generalised symptoms (headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, 
irritation of skin and eyes) besides psychological, neuro-
logical, cardiorespiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms 
coupled with low plasma ChE activity (Gupta et al., 1984).
Data on reproductive toxicity were collected from 1,106 
couples when the males were associated with the spraying of 
pesticides (OC, OP and carbamates) in cotton fields (Rupa 
et al., 1991).A study in malaria spraymen was initiated to 
evaluate the effects of a short-term (16 week) exposure in 
workers (N=216) spraying HCH in field conditions (Gupta 
et al., 1982). 
A study on those affected in the Seveso diaster of 1976 in 
Italy during the production of 2,4,5 T, a herbicide, concluded 
that chloracne (nearly 200 cases with a definite exposure 
dependence) was the only effect established with certainty 
as a result of dioxin formation (Pier et al., 1998). Early health 
investigations including liver function, immune function, 
neurologic impairment, and reproductive effects yielded 
inconclusive results. An excess mortality from cardiovascu-
lar and respiratory diseases was uncovered, possibly related 
to the psychosocial consequences of the accident in addition 
to the chemical contamination. An excess of diabetes cases 
was also found. Results of cancer incidence and mortality 
follow-up showed an increased occurrence of cancer of the 
gastrointestinal sites and of the lymphatic and haematopoi-
etic tissue. Results cannot be viewed as conclusive, however, 
because of various limitations: few individual exposure data, 
short latency period, and small population size for certain 
cancer types. A similar study in 2001 observed no increase 
in all-cause and all-cancer mortality. However, the results 
support the notion that dioxin is carcinogenic to humans 
and corroborate the hypotheses of its association with 
cardiovascular- and endocrine-related effects (Pier et al., 
2001). During the Vietnam War, United States military 
forces sprayed nearly 19 million gallons of herbicide on 
approximately 3.6 million acres of Vietnamese and Laotian 
land to remove forest cover, destroy crops, and clear vegeta-
tion from the perimeters of US bases. This effort, known as 
Operation Ranch Hand, lasted from 1962 to 1971. Various 
herbicide formulations were used, but most were mixtures 
of the phenoxy herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 
(2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). 
Approximately 3 million Americans served in the armed 
forces in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Some of them 
(as well as some Vietnamese combatants and civilians, and 
members of the armed forces of other nations) were exposed 
to defoliant mixtures, including Agent Orange. There was 
evidence on cancer risk of Vietnam veterans, workers occu-
pationally exposed to herbicides or dioxins (since dioxins 
contaminated the herbicide mixtures used in Vietnam), and 
of the Vietnamese population (Frumkin, 2003). 
Im pact through food commodities
For determining the extent of pesticide contamination in 
the food stuffs, programs entitled ‘Monitoring of Pesticide 
Residues in Products of Plant Origin in the European Union’ 
started to be established in the European Union since 
1996. In 1996, seven pesticides (acephate, chlopyriphos, 
chlopyriphos-methyl, methamidophos, iprodione, procy-
midone and chlorothalonil) and two groups of pesticides 
(benomyl group and maneb group, i.e. dithiocarbamates) 
were analysed in apples, tomatoes, lettuce, strawberries 
and grapes. An average of about 9 700 samples has been 
analysed for each pesticide or pesticide group. For each 
pesticide or pesticide group, 5.2% of the samples were found 
to contain residues and 0.31% had residues higher than the 
respective MRL for that specific pesticide. Lettuce was

the crop with the highest number of positive results, with 
residue levels exceeding the MRLs more frequently than 
in any of the other crops investigated. The highest value 
found in 1996 was for a compound of the maneb group 
in lettuce which corresponded to a mancozeb residue of 
118 mg/kg. In 1997, 13 pesticides (acephate, carbendazin, 
chlorothalonil, chlopyriphos, DDT, diazinon, endosulfan, 
methamidophos, iprodione, metalaxyl, methidathion, thia-
bendazole, triazophos) were assessed in five commodities 
(mandarins, pears, bananas,beans, and potatoes). Some 
6 000 samples were analysed. Residues of chlorpyriphos 
exceeded MRLs most often (0.24%), followed by meth-
amidophos (0.18%), and iprodione (0.13%). With regard 
to the commodities investigated, around 34% contained 
pesticide residues at or below the MRL, and 1% contained 
residues at levels above the MRL. In mandarins, pesticide 
residues were most frequently found at levels at or below 
the MRL (69%), followed by bananas (51%), pears (28%), 
beans (21%) and potatoes (9%). MRLs were exceeded most 
often in beans (1.9%), followed by mandarins (1.8%), pears 
(1.3%), and bananas and potatoes (0.5%). Estimation of 
the dietary intake of pesticide residues (based on the 90th 
percentile) from the above-mentioned commodities, where 
the highest residue levels of the respective pesticides were 
found, shows that there is no exceeding of the ADI with 
all the pesticides and commodities studied (European 
Commission, 1999). In 1998, four commodities (oranges, 
peaches, carrots, spinach) were analysed for 20 pesticides 
(acephate, benomyl group, chlopyriphos, chlopyriphos-
methyl, deltamethrin, maneb group, diazinon, endosulfan, 
methamidophos, iprodione,metalaxyl, methidathion, 
thiabendazole, triazophos, permethrin, vinclozolin, lamb-
dacyalothrin, pirimiphos-methyl, mercabam). With regard 
to all four commodities investigated in 1998 (oranges, 
peaches, carrots, spinach), about 32%contained residues of 
pesticides at or below MRL, and 2% above the MRL (1.8% 
for EU-MRLs, 0.4% for national MRLs). Residues at or below 
the MRL were found most often in oranges (67%), followed 
by peaches (21%), carrots (11%) and spinach (5%).MRL val-
ues were exceeded most often in spinach (7.3%), followed by 
peaches (1.6%), carrots (1.2%)and oranges (0.7%). The intake 
of pesticide residues has not exceeded the ADI in any case. 
It was found to be below 10% of the ADI for all pesticides. 
The exposure ranges from 0.35% of the ADI for the benomyl 
group to 9.9% of the ADI for the methidathion group. In 
1999, four commodities (cauliflower, peppers, wheat grains, 
and melon) were analysed for the same 20 pesticides as in 
the 1998 study (European Commission, 2001). Overall, 
around 4700 samples were analysed. Residues of meth-
amidophos exceeded MRLs most often (8.7%), followed by 
the maneb group (1.1%), thiabendazole (0.57%), acephate 
(0.41%) and the benomyl group (0.35%).The MRL for 
methamidophos was exceeded most often in peppers and 
melons (18.7 and 3.7%, respectively). The residues of the 
maneb group exceeded the MRL most often in cauliflower 
(3.9%); residues of thiabendazole exceeded the MRL most 
often in melons (2.8% of the melon samples). With regard 
to all the commodities investigated, around 22% of samples 
contained residues of pesticides at or below the MRL and 
8.7% above the MRL. Residues at or below MRLwere found 
most often in melons (32%), followed by peppers (24%), 
wheat grains (21%) and cauliflower (17%). MRL values were 
exceeded most often in peppers (19%), followed by melons 
(6.1%), cauliflower (3%) and wheat grains (0.5%). The intake 
of pesticide residues did not exceed the ADI in any case. It 
was below 1.5% of the ADI for all pesticides. The exposure 
ranged between 0.43% of the ADI for methamidophos and 
1.4% of the ADI for endosulfan. The intakes for the high-
est residue levels in a composite sample for chlorpyriphos, 
deltamethrin, endosulfan and methidathion were below 
the ARfD for adults. They range between 1.5% of the ARfD 
for deltamethrin and 67% of the ARfD for endosulfan 
(Nasreddine and Parent-Massin, 2002). In spite of food con-
tamination, most pesticide deaths recorded in hospital sur-
veys are the result of self-poisoning (Eddleston, 2000). The 
Global Burden of Disease Study 6 estimated that 798 000 
people died from deliberate self-harm in 1990, over 75% of 
whom were from developing countries (Murray and Lopez, 
1996). More recent WHO estimates showed that over 500 
000 people died from self-harm in Southeast Asia and the 
Western Pacific during 2000 alone (WHO, 2001). Suicide 
is the commonest cause of death in young Chinese women 
and Sri Lankan men and women (Murray and Lopez, 1996; 
Sri Lankan Ministry of Health, 1995; WHO, 2001).
 In India the first report of poisoning due to pesticides 
was from Kerala in 1958, where over 100 people died after 
consuming wheat flour contaminated with parathion 
(Karunakaran, 1958). This prompted the Special Committee 
on Harmful Effects of Pesticides constituted by the ICAR 
to focus attention on the problem (Report of the Special 
Committee of ICAR, 1972). In a multi-centric study to 
assess the pesticide residues in selected food commodities 
collected from different states of the country (Surveillance 
of Food Contaminants in India, 1993), DDT residues were 
found in about 82% of the 2205 samples of bovine milk col-
lected from 12 states. About 37% of the samples contained 
DDT residues above the tolerance limit of 0.05 mg/kg 
(whole milk basis). The highest level of DDT residues found 
was 2.2 mg/kg. The proportion of the samples with residues 
above the tolerance limit was highest in Maharastra (74%), 
followed by Gujarat (70%), Andhra Pradesh (57%), Himachal 
Pradesh (56%), and Punjab (51%). In the remaining states, 
this proportion was less than 10%. Data on 186 samples of 
20 commercial brands of infants formulae showed the pres-
ence of residues of DDT and HCH isomers in about 70 and 
94% of the samples with their maximum level of 4.3 and 5.7 
mg/kg (fat basis) respectively. Measurement of chemicals in 
the total diet provides the best estimates of human exposure 
and of the potential risk. The risk of consumers may then 
be evaluated by comparison with toxicologically acceptable 
intake levels. The average total DDT and BHC consumed by 
an adult were 19.24 mg/day and 77.15 mg/day respectively 
(Kashyap et al., 1994). Fatty food was the main source of 
these contaminants. In another study, the average daily 
intake of HCH and DDT by Indians was reported to be 115 
and 48 mg per person respectively, which were higher than 
those observed in most of the developed countries (Kannan 
et al., 1992).

Impact on environment
Pesticides can contaminate soil, water, turf, and other veg-
etation. In addition to killing insects or weeds, pesticides 
can be toxic to a host of other organisms including birds, 
fish, beneficial insects, and non-target plants. Insecticides 
are generally the most acutely toxic class of pesticides, but 
herbicides can also pose risks to non-target organisms.
Surface water contamination
Pesticides can reach surface water through runoff from 
treated plants and soil. Contamination of water by pesti-
cides is widespread. The results of a comprehensive set of 
studies done by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) on major 
river basins across the country in the early to mid- 90s 
yielded startling results. More than 90 percent of water and 
fish samples from all streams contained one, or more often, 
several pesticides (Kole et al; 2001). Pesticides were found 
in all samples from major rivers with mixed agricultural 
and urban land use influences and 99 percent of samples 
of urban streams (Bortleson and Davis, 1987–1995). The 
USGS also found that concentrations of insecticides in 
urban streams commonly exceeded guidelines for protec-
tion of aquatic life (U.S. Geological Survey,1999). Twenty-
three pesticides were detected in waterways in the Puget 
Sound Basin, including 17 herbicides. According to USGS, 
more pesticides were detected in urban streams than in 
agricultural streams (US Department of the Interior, 1995). 
The herbicides 2,4-D, diuron, and prometon, and the insec-
ticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon, all commonly used by 
urban homeowners and school districts, were among the 21 
pesticides detected most often in surface and ground water 
across the nation (U.S. Geological Survey, 1998). Trifluralin 
and 2,4-D were found in water samples collected in 19 out 
of the 20 river basins studied (Bevans et al., 1998; Fenelon et 
al., 1998; Levings et al., 1998; Wall et al., 1998). The USGS 
also found that concentrations of insecticides in urban 
streams commonly exceeded guidelines for protection of 
aquatic life (U.S. Geological Survey, 1999). According to 
USGS, “in general more pesticides were detected in urban 
streams than in agricultural streams”, (Bortleson and Davis, 
1987–1995). The herbicide 2,4-D was the most commonly 
found pesticide, detected in 12 out of 13 streams. The 
insecticide diazinon, and the weed-killers dichlobenil, diu-
ron, triclopyr, and glyphosate were detected also in Puget 
Sound basin streams. Both diazinon and diuron were found 
at levels exceeding concentrations recommended by the 
National Academy of Sciences for the protection of aquatic 
life (Bortleson and Davis, 1987–1995). 
Ground water contamination
Groundwater pollution due to pesticides is a worldwide 
problem. According to the USGS, at least 143 different pes-
ticides and 21 transformation products have been found in 
ground water, including pesticides from every major chemi-
cal class. Over the past two decades, detections have been 
found in the ground water of more than 43 states (Waskom, 
1994). During one survey in India, 58% of drinking water 
samples drawn from various hand pumps and wells around 
Bhopal were contaminated with Organo Chlorine pesticides 
above the EPA standards (Kole and Bagchi, 1995). Once 
ground water is polluted with toxic chemicals, it may take 
many years for the contamination to dissipate or be cleaned 
up. Cleanup may also be very costly and complex, if not 
impossible (Waskom 1994; O’Neil, 1998; US EPA, 2001).
Soil contamination
A large number of transformation products (TPs) from a 
wide range of pesticides have been documented (Barcelo’ 
and Hennion, 1997; Roberts, 1998; Roberts and Hutson, 
1999). Not many of all possible pesticide TPs have been 
monitored in soil, showing that there is a pressing need 
for more studies in this field. Persistency and movement 
of these pesticides and their TPs are determined by some 
parameters, such as water solubility, soil-sorption constant 
(Koc), the octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow), and 
half-life in soil (DT50). Pesticides and TPs could be grouped 
into:(a) Hydrophobic, persistent, and bioaccumulable 
pesticides that are strongly bound to soil. Pesticides that 
exhibit such behavior include the organochlorine DDT, 
endosulfan, endrin, heptachlor,lindane and their TPs. Most 
of them are now banned in agriculture but their residues 
are still present. (b) Polar pesticides are represented mainly 
by herbicides but they include also carbamates, fungicides 
and some organophosphorus insecticide TPs. They can 
be moved from soil by runoff and leaching, thereby con-
stituting a problem for the supply of drinking water to 
the population. The most researched pesticide TPs in soil 
are undoubtedly those from herbicides. Several metabolic 
pathways have been suggested, involving transformation 
through hydrolysis, methylation, and ring cleavage that pro-
duce several toxic phenolic compounds. The pesticides and 
their TPs are retained by soils to different degrees, depend-
ing on the interactions between soil and pesticide proper-
ties. The most influential soil characteristic is the organic 
matter content. The larger the organic matter content, the 
greater the adsorption of pesticides and TPs. The capacity 
of the soil to hold positively charged ions in an exchangeable 
form is important with paraquat and other pesticides that 
are positively charged. Strong mineral acid is required for 
extracting these chemicals, without any analytical improve-
ment or study reported in recent years. Soil pH is also of 
some importance. Adsorption increases with decreasing 
soil pH for ionizable pesticides (e.g. 2,4-D,2,4,5-T, picloram, 
and atrazine) (Andreu and Pico’, 2004).
Eﬀ ect on soil fertility (beneﬁ cial soil microorganisms)
Heavy treatment of soil with pesticides can cause 
populations of beneficial soil microorganisms to decline. 
According to the soil scientist Dr. Elaine Ingham, “If we lose 
both bacteria and fungi, then the soil degrades. Overuse of 
chemical fertilizers and pesticides have effects on the soil 
organisms that are similar to human overuse of antibiot-
ics. Indiscriminate use of chemicals might work for a few 
years, but after awhile, there aren’t enough beneficial soil 
organisms to hold onto the nutrients” (Savonen, 1997). For 
example, plants depend on a variety of soil microorganisms 
to transform atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates, which 
plants can use. Common landscape herbicides disrupt

this process: triclopyr inhibits soil bacteria that transform 
ammonia into nitrite (Pell et al., 1998); glyphosate reduces 
the growth and activity of free-living nitrogen-fixing bacte-
ria in soil (Santos and Flores, 1995) and 2,4-D reduces nitro-
gen fixation by the bacteria that live on the roots of bean 
plants (Arias and Fabra, 1993; Fabra et al., 1997), reduces 
the growth and activity of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae 
(Singh and Singh, 1989; Tözüm-Çalgan and Sivaci-Güner, 
1993), and inhibits the transformation of ammonia into 
nitrates by soil bacteria (Frankenberger et al., 1991, Martens 
and Bremner, 1993). Mycorrhizal fungi grow with the roots 
of many plants and aid in nutrient uptake. These fungi can 
also be damaged by herbicides in the soil. One study found 
that oryzalin and trifluralin both inhibited the growth of 
certain species of mycorrhizal fungi (Kelley and South, 
1978). Roundup has been shown to be toxic to mycorrhizal 
fungi in laboratory studies, and some damaging effects were 
seen at concentrations lower than those found in soil follow-
ing typical applications (Chakravarty and Sidhu, 1987; Estok 
et al., 1989). Triclopyr was also found to be toxic to several 
species of mycorrhizal fungi (Chakravarty and Sidhu, 1987) 
and oxadiazon reduced the number of mycorrhizal fungal 
spores (Moorman, 1989). 
Contamination of air, soil, and non-target vegetation 
Pesticide sprays can directly hit non-target vegetation, or 
can drift or volatilize from the treated area and contami-
nate air, soil, and non-target plants. Some pesticide drift 
occurs during every application, even from ground equip-
ment (Glotfelty and Schomburg, 1989). Drift can account 
for a loss of 2 to 25% of the chemical being applied, which 
can spread over a distance of a few yards to several hundred 
miles. As much as 80–90% of an applied pesticide can be 
volatilised within a few days of application (Majewski, 
1995). Despite the fact that only limited research has been 
done on the topic, studies consistently find pesticide resi-
dues in air. According to the USGS, pesticides have been 
detected in the atmosphere in all sampled areas of the USA 
(Savonen, 1997). Nearly every pesticide investigated has 
been detected in rain, air, fog, or snow across the nation at 
different times of the year (U.S. Geological Survey, 1999). 
Many pesticides have been detected in air at more than 
half the sites sampled nationwide. Herbicides are designed 
to kill plants, so it is not surprising that they can injure or 
kill desirable species if they are applied directly to such 
plants, or if they drift or volatilise onto them. Many ester-
formulation herbicides have been shown to volatilise off 
treated plants with vapors sufficient to cause severe dam-
age to other plants (Straathoff, 1986). In addition to killing 
non-target plants outright, pesticide exposure can cause 
sublethal effects on plants. Phenoxy herbicides, including 
2,4-D, can injure nearby trees and shrubs if they drift or 
volatilise onto leaves (Dreistadt et al., 1994). Exposure to 
the herbicide glyphosate can severely reduce seed quality 
(Locke et al., 1995). It can also increase the susceptibility 
of certain plants to disease (Brammall and Higgins, 1998). 
This poses a special threat to endangered plant species. The 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has recognized 74 endangered 
plants that may be threatened by glyphosate alone (U.S. EPA 
Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances, 1986). Exposure 
to the herbicide clopyralid can reduce yields in potato 
plants (Lucas and Lobb, 1987). EPA calculated that volatili-
sation of only 1% of applied clopyralid is enough to damage 
non-target plants (US EPA, 1990). Some insecticides and 
fungicides can also damage plants (Dreistadt et al., 1994). 
Pesticide damage to plants is commonly reported to state 
agencies in the Northwest. (Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 
1999; Washington Dept. of Health, 1999). Plants can also 
suffer indirect consequences of pesticide applications when 
harm is done to soil microorganisms and beneficial insects. 
Pesticides including those of new the generation, e.g., 
dacthal, chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, metolachlor, terbufos 
and trifluralin have been detected in Arctic environmental 
samples (air, fog, water, snow) (Rice and Cherniak, 1997), and 
(Garbarino et al., 2002). Other studies have identified the 
ability of some of these compounds to undergo short-range 
atmospheric transport (Muir et al., 2004) to ecologically 
sensitive regions such as the Chesapeake Bay and the Sierra 
Nevada mountains (LeNoir et al., 1999; McConnell et al., 
1997; Harman-Fetcho et al., 2000, Thurman and Cromwell 
, 2000). One long-term study that investigated pesticides 
in the atmosphere of British Columbia (BC), dating from 
1996 (Belzer et al., 1998) showed that 57 chemicals were 
investigated at two sampling sites (Agassiz and Abbotsford) 
in the Fraser Valley, from February 1996 until March 1997. 
Atrazine, malathion, and diazinon, highly toxic chemicals 
identified as high-priority pesticides by Verrin et al. (2004), 
were detected as early as the end of February (72 pg/m3) 
until mid-October (253 pg/m3), with a peak concentration 
in mid-June of 42.7 ngm-3. Dichlorvos is a decomposition 
product of another pesticide, Naled (Dibrom) (Hall et al., 
1997). Captan and 2,4-D showed the highest concentra-
tions and deposition rates at these two sites, followed by 
dichlorvos and diazinon (Dosman and Cockcraft, 1989). 
Air concentrations of currently used pesticides in Alberta 
were investigated in 1999 at four sampling sites that were 
chosen according to geography and pesticide sales data 
(Kumar, 2001). Triallate and trifluralin were the two 
mostly detected pesticides at the four sites. Insecticides 
(malathion, chlorpyrifos, diazinon and endosulfan) were 
detected intermittently with concentrations in the range 
20–780 pg/m3. South of Regina, Saskatchewan, in 1989 and 
1990, 2,4-D reached 3.9 and 3.6 ng/m3 at the end of June 
(Waite et al., 2002a). Triallate, dicamba, bromoxynil con-
centrations were also higher in 1989 (peak concentration 
of 4.2 ng/m3 in mid-June) compared with 1990 (600–700 
pg/m3 in mid-June). In a more recent study, Waite et al. 
(2005) studied spatial variations of selected herbicides on 
a threesite, 500km transect that included two agricultural 
sites—Bratt’s Lake, located 35 km southwest of Regina and 
Hafford to the North—and a background site at Waskesiu. 
Some acid herbicides were also investigated in South 
Tobacco Creek, Manitoba during 1993–1996. Once again, 
maximum concentrations occurred during periods of local 
use (Rawn et al., 1999a). A neutral herbicide, atrazine, was 
also investigated in 1995 (Rawn et al., 1998). It was first 
detected in mid-April, peaked mid- June at about 300 pg/m3, 
and was detected until the end of October. The insecticide

dacthal was identified throughout the sampling periods in 
1994, 1995 and 1996 (Rawn and Muir, 1999) even though it 
was not used in this area (<20–300 pg/m3). 
Non-target organisms 
Pesticides are found as common contaminants in soil, air, 
water and on non-target organisms in our urban landscapes. 
Once there, they can harm plants and animals ranging 
from beneficial soil microorganisms and insects, non-
target plants, fish, birds, and other wildlife. Chlorpyrifos, 
a common contaminant of urban streams (U.S. Geological 
Survey, 1999), is highly toxic to fish, and has caused fish, 
kills in waterways near treated fields or buildings (US EPA, 
2000). Herbicides can also be toxic to fish. According to the 
EPA, studies show that trifluralin, an active ingredient in 
the weed-killer Snapshot, “is highly to very highly toxic to 
both cold and warm water fish” (U.S. EPA, 1996). In a series 
of different tests it was also shown to cause vertebral defor-
mities in fish (Koyama, 1996). The weed-killers Ronstar and 
Roundup are also acutely toxic to fish (Folmar et al., 1979; 
Shafiei and Costa, 1990). The toxicity of Roundup is likely 
due to the high toxicity of one of the inert ingredients of 
the product (Folmar et al., 1979). In addition to direct acute 
toxicity, some herbicides may produce sublethal effects on 
fish that lessen their chances for survival and threaten the 
population as a whole. Glyphosate or glyphosate-containing 
products can cause sublethal effects such as erratic swim-
ming and labored breathing, which increase the fish’s 
chance of being eaten (Liong et al., 1988). 2,4-D herbicides 
caused physiological stress responses in sockeye salmon 
(McBride et al., 1981) and reduced the food-gathering 
abilities of rainbow trout (Little, 1990). Several cases of 
pesticide poisoning of dolphins have been reported world-
wide. Because of their high trophic level in the food chain 
and relatively low activities of drug-metabolising enzymes, 
aquatic mammals such as dolphins accumulate increased 
concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (Tanabe et 
al., 1988) and are thereby vulnerable to toxic effects from 
contaminant exposures. Dolphins inhabiting riverine and 
estuarine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the 
activities of humans because of the restricted confines of 
their habitat, which is in close proximity to point sources 
of pollution. River dolphins are among the world’s most 
seriously endangered species. Populations of river dolphins 
have been dwindling and face the threat of extinction; the 
Yangtze river dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer) in China and 
the Indus river dolphin (Platanista minor) in Pakistan are 
already close to extinction (Renjun, 1990; Perrin et al., 
1989; Reeves et al., 1991; Reeves and Chaudhry, 1998). In 
addition to habitat degradation (such as construction of 
dams) (Reeves and Leatherwood, 1994), boat traffic, fishing, 
incidental and intentional killings, and chemical pollution 
have been threats to the health of river dolphins (Kannan 
et al., 1993b, 1994, 1997; Senthilkumar et al., 1999). Earlier 
studies reported concentrations of heavy metals (Kannan 
et al., 1993), organochlorine pesticides and polychlori-
nated biphenyls (PCBs) (Kannan et al., 1994), and butyltin 
compounds (Kannan et al., 1997) in Ganges river dolphins 
and their prey. The continuing use of organochlorine 
pesticides and PCBs in India is of concern (Kannan et al., 
1992; Kannan et al., 1997a; Kannan et al., 1997b; Tanabe 
et al., 1998). The Ganges river basin is densely populated 
and heavily polluted by fertilizers, pesticides, and industrial 
and domestic effluents (Mohan, 1989). In addition to fish, 
other marine or freshwater animals are endangered by 
pesticide contamination. Exposure to great concentrations 
of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic contaminants 
such as DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis[p-chlorophenyl]
ethane) and PCBs has been shown to elicit adverse effects 
on reproductive and immunological functions in captive 
or wild aquatic mammals (Helle et al., 1976; Reijnders, 
1986; Ross et al., 1995; Martineau et al., 1987; Kannan et 
al., 1993; Colborn and Smolen, 1996). Aquatic mammals 
inhabiting freshwater systems, such as otters and mink, 
have been reported to be sensitive to chemical contamina-
tion (Leonards et al., 1995; Leonards et al., 1997). 2,4-D or 
2,4-D containing products have been shown to be harmful 
to shellfish (Cheney et al., 1997) and other aquatic species 
(U.S. EPA, 1989; Sanders, 1989) The weed-killer trifluralin 
is moderately to highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates, and 
highly toxic to estuarine and marine organisms like shrimp 
and mussels (U.S. EPA, 1996). Since herbicides are designed 
to kill plants, it makes sense that herbicide contamination 
of water could have devastating effects on aquatic plants. 
In one study, oxadiazon was found to severely reduce algae 
growth (Ambrosi et al., 1978). Algae is a staple organism 
in the food chain of aquatic ecosystems. Studies looking 
at the impacts of the herbicides atrazine and alachlor on 
algae and diatoms in streams showed that even at fairly low 
levels, the chemicals damaged cells, blocked photosynthe-
sis, and stunted growth in varying ways (U.S. Water News 
Online, 2000). The herbicide oxadiazon is also toxic to 
bees, which are pollinators (Washington State Department 
of Transportation, 1993). Herbicides may hurt insects or 
spiders also indirectly when they destroy the foliage that 
these animals need for food and shelter. For example spi-
der and carabid beetle populations declined when 2,4-D 
applications destroyed their natural habitat (Asteraki et 
al., 1992). Non-target birds may also be killed if they ingest 
poisoned grains set out as bait for pigeons and rodents (US 
EPA, 1998). Avitrol, a commonly used pigeon bait, poses 
a large potential for ingestion by non target grain feeding 
birds. It can be lethal to small seed-eating birds (Extoxnet, 
1996). Brodifacoum, a common rodenticide, is highly toxic 
to birds. It also poses a secondary poisoning hazard to 
birds that may feed on poisoned rodents (US EPA, 1998). 
Herbicides can also be toxic to birds. Although trifluralin 
was considered “practically nontoxic to birds” in studies of 
acute toxicity, birds exposed multiple times to the herbicide 
experienced diminished reproductive success in the form 
of cracked eggs (U.S. EPA, 1996). Exposure of eggs to 2,4-D 
reduced successful hatching of chicken eggs (Duffard et 
al., 1981) and caused feminisation or sterility in pheasant 
chicks (Lutz et al., 1972). Herbicides can also adversely 
affect birds by destroying their habitat. Glyphosate 
treatment in clear cuts caused dramatic decreases in the 
populations of birds that lived there (MacKinnon et al., 
1993) Effects of some organochlorines (OCs) on fish-eating

water birds and marine mammals have been documented 
in North America and Europe (Barron et al., 1995; Cooke, 
1979; Kubiak et al., 1989). Despite the continuing usage, 
little is known about the impacts of OCs in bird populations 
in developing countries. Among the countries that continue 
to use OCs, India has been one of the major producers and 
consumers in recent years. As a consequence, wild birds 
in India are exposed to great amounts of OC pesticides 
(Tanabe et al., 1998). Use of OCs in tropical countries 
may not only result in exposure of resident birds but also 
of migratory birds when they visit tropical regions in 
winter. The Indian sub-continent is a host to a multitude 
of birds from western Asia, Europe and Arctic Russia in 
winter(Woodcock, 1980). Hundreds of species of waterfowl, 
including wading birds such as plovers, terns and sandpip-
ers, migrate each winter to India covering long distances 
(Grewal, 1990). While concentrations of OC pesticides in 
wholebody homogenates of birds have been reported else-
where (Tanabe et al., 1998), concentrations of OCs in prey 
items and in eggs of Indian birds have not been reported.
A few studies related to the decline in the populations 
of bats in various parts of the world to OC exposure were 
also being conducted (Altenbach et al., 1979; Clark, 1976; 
Clark, 1983; Clark, 1981; Geluso et al., 1976; Jefferies, 1976; 
Thies and Mc Bee, 1994). The world population of bats was 
estimated to be 8.7 million during 1936 and it declined to 
approximately 200,000 in 1973 (Geluso et al., 1976) It has 
recovered slightly to an estimated number of 700,000 in 
1991 (Geluso et al., 1976; Thies and Mc Bee, 1994). High tis-
sue concentrations of p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene 
(p,p’–DDE) have been found in bats in Carlsbad Caverns 
in Mexico and in New Mexico in the USA (Geluso et al., 
1976; Thies and Mc Bee, 1994). Occurrence of stillbirths in 
little brown bats exposed to high concentrations of PCBs, 
p,p’–DDE, and/or oxychlordane was documented (Clark, 
1976; Jefferies, 1976). These observations indicate that bats 
can accumulate high concentrations of OCs and may be 
affected by their potential toxic effects. The flying fox or 
the new world fruit bat, short-nosed fruit bat and Indian 
pipistrelle bat are resident species and are very common in 
South India. Their habitat is mainly agricultural areas, rock 
caves, and abandoned houses in domesticated areas. Insects 
constitute an important diet for many bats, allowing the 
passage of OCs in their body (Mc Bee et al., 1992). Several 
studies found OC pesticides and PCBs in livers and eggs 
of birds in developed countries (Becker, 1989; Bernardz 
et al., 1990; Cade et al., 1989; Castillo et al., 1994; Mora, 
1996; Mora, 1997). Similarly, several studies reported OCs 
in a variety of biota including humans and wildlife from 
India (Senthilkumar et al., 2000). However, no study has 
used whole body homogenates of birds, which is important 
to evaluate biomagnification features and body burdens 
of OCs (Mc Bee et al., 1992). Earlier studies used specific 
body tissues to estimate biomagnification of OCs. However 
theoretically, estimation of biomagnification factors 
requires whole body concentrations rather than specific 
tissue concentrations.
Conclusion
The data on environmental-cum-health risk assess-
ment studies may be regarded as an aid towards a better 
understanding of the problem. Data on the occurrence of 
pesticide-related illnesses among defined populations in 
developing countries are scanty. Generation of base-line 
descriptive epidemiological data based on area profiles, 
development of intervention strategies designed to lower 
the incidence of acute poisoning and periodic surveillance 
studies on high risk groups are needed. Our efforts should 
include investigations of outbreaks and accidental exposure 
to pesticides, correlation studies, cohort analyses, prospec-
tive studies and randomised trials of intervention proce-
dures. Valuable information can be collected by monitoring 
the end product of human exposure in the form of residue 
levels in body fluids and tissues of the general population. 
The importance of education and training of workers as 
a major vehicle to ensure a safe use of pesticides is being 
increasingly recognised. 
Because of the extensive benefits which man accrues 
from pesticides, these chemicals provide the best oppor-
tunity to those who juggle with the risk-benefit equations. 
The economic impact of pesticides in non-target species 
(including humans) has been estimated at approximately $8 
billion annually in developing countries. What is required 
is to weigh all the risks against the benefits to ensure a 
maximum margin of safety. The total cost-benefit picture 
from pesticide use differs appreciably between developed 
and developing countries. For developing countries it is 
imperative to use pesticides, as no one would prefer fam-
ine and communicable diseases like malaria. It may thus 
be expedient to accept a reasonable degree of risk. Our 
approach to the use of pesticides should be pragmatic. In 
other words, all activities concerning pesticides should 
be based on scientific judgement and not on commercial 
considerations. There are some inherent difficulties in fully 
evaluating the risks to human health due to pesticides. For 
example there is a large number of human variables such as 
age, sex, race, socio-economic status, diet, state of health, 
etc. – all of which affect human exposure to pesticides. 
But practically little is known about the effects of these 
variables. The long-term effects of low level exposure to one 
pesticide are greatly influenced by concomitant exposure to 
other pesticides as well as to pollutants present in air, water, 
food and drugs.
Pesticides are often considered a quick, easy, and 
inexpensive solution for controlling weeds and insect 
pests in urban landscapes. However, pesticide use comes 
at a significant cost. Pesticides have contaminated almost 
every part of our environment. Pesticide residues are found 
in soil and air, and in surface and ground water across 
the countries, and urban pesticide uses contribute to the 
problem. Pesticide contamination poses significant risks 
to the environment and non-target organisms ranging 
from beneficial soil microorganisms, to insects, plants, 
fish, and birds. Contrary to common misconceptions, even 
herbicides can cause harm to the environment. In fact, weed 
killers can be especially problematic because they are used

in relatively large volumes. The best way to reduce pesticide 
contamination (and the harm it causes) in our environment 
is for all of us to do our part to use safer, non-chemical pest 
control (including weed control) methods. 
The exercise of analysing the range and nature of ben-
efits arising from pesticide use has been a mixture of delv-
ing, dreaming and distillation. There have been blind alleys, 
but also positive surprises. The general picture is as we 
suspected: there is publicity, ideological kudos and scientific 
opportunity associated with ‘knocking’ pesticides, while 
praising them brings accusations of vested interests. This 
is reflected in the imbalance in the number of published 
scientific papers, reports, newspaper articles and websites 
against and for pesticides. The colour coding for types of 
benefit, economic, social or environmental, reveals the fact 
that at community level, most of the benefits are social, with 
some compelling economic benefits. At national level, the 
benefits are principally economic, with some social benefits 
and one or two issues of environmental benefits. It is only 
at global level that the environmental benefits really come 
into play.
There is a need to convey the message that prevention of 
adverse health effects and promotion of health are profitable 
investments for employers and employees as a support to a 
sustainable development of economics. To sum up, based on 
our limited knowledge of direct and/or inferential informa-
tion, the domain of pesticides illustrates a certain ambiguity 
in situations in which people are undergoing life-long expo-
sure. There is thus every reason to develop health education 
packages based on knowledge, aptitude and practices and 
to disseminate them within the community in order to 
minimise human exposure to pesticides.
