Interleukin (IL)-2 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of natural immunologic self-
tolerance. Neutralization of circulating IL-2 by anti–IL-2 monoclonal antibody for a limited 
period elicits autoimmune gastritis in BALB/c mice. Similar treatment of diabetes-prone 
nonobese diabetic mice triggers early onset of diabetes and produces a wide spectrum of T 
cell–mediated autoimmune diseases, including gastritis, thyroiditis, sialadenitis, and notably, 
severe neuropathy. Such treatment selectively reduces the number of Foxp3-expressing 
CD25 CD4 T cells, but not CD25 CD4 T cells, in the thymus and periphery of normal and 
thymectomized mice. IL-2 neutralization inhibits physiological proliferation of peripheral 
CD25 CD4 T cells that are presumably responding to normal self-antigens, whereas it is 
unable to inhibit their lymphopenia-induced homeostatic expansion in a T cell–deficient 
environment. In normal naive mice, CD25low CD4 nonregulatory T cells actively transcribe 
the IL-2 gene and secrete IL-2 protein in the physiological state. IL-2 is thus indispensable 
for the peripheral maintenance of natural CD25 CD4 regulatory T cells (T reg cells). The 
principal physiological source of IL-2 for the maintenance of T reg cells appears to be other 
T cells, especially CD25low CD4 activated T cells, which include self-reactive T cells. 
Furthermore, impairment of this negative feedback loop via IL-2 can be a cause and a 
predisposing factor for autoimmune disease.
Accumulating evidence indicates that IL-2 may
contribute to the maintenance of natural im-
munologic self-tolerance and prevention of au-
toimmune disease. For example, IL-2–deficient
(IL-2/) mice succumb to lethal immunopa-
thology that includes autoimmune components
(1, 2). Autoimmune disease, such as type 1 dia-
betes (T1D), can be prevented in animal models
by IL-2 administration (3–5). Allelic variations
of the IL-2 gene are associated with genetic
susceptibility to T1D and experimental allergic
encephalitis (EAE) in animal models (6). Fur-
thermore, the majority of naturally arising
CD4 regulatory T cells (T reg cells) express
CD25, the IL-2R
 
 
 
chain, and abnormality in
their development or function leads to various
autoimmune diseases, including T1D in rodents
and humans (7, 8). These findings collectively in-
dicate a common role of IL-2 in various autoim-
mune diseases. In this report we have attempted
to determine how IL-2 contributes to the devel-
opment of autoimmune disease, in particular,
whether neutralization of circulating IL-2 can
cause autoimmune disease in otherwise normal
animals.
Naturally arising CD25 CD4 T reg cells,
which constitute 5–10% of peripheral CD4 T
cells in normal rodents and humans, are pro-
duced at least in part by the normal thymus as a
functionally mature and distinct subpopulation
of T cells (9). They play key roles not only for
the maintenance of immunologic self-tolerance,
but also for the control of aberrant or excessive
immune responses to invading or commensal

microbes and to innocuous environmental substances. For
example, depletion of CD25-expressing CD4 T cells elicits
autoimmune disease in otherwise normal rodents (8). Genetic
abnormality of the Foxp3 gene, which is specifically expressed
in natural CD25 CD4 T reg cells, impairs their develop-
ment and function, causing severe autoimmune diseases (in
particular T1D), allergy, and inflammatory bowel disease
in humans (7). 
 
Foxp3
 
 also controls the expression of CD25 in
natural T reg cells (10). These findings illustrate CD25 to be a
good marker for natural T reg cells. CD25 is, on the other
hand, expressed on any T cell upon activation (11, 12).
Therefore, a critical issue is to determine whether CD25 is
merely an indicator of the chronically activated state of natu-
ral T reg cells or a key molecule, specific and essential for
their generation, maintenance, or function as an indispensable
component of the high affinity IL-2R (13). If the latter is the
case, it needs to be determined which cells are the physiolog-
ical source of IL-2 for natural T reg cells.
Although IL-2 was initially supposed to be an essential
cytokine for T cell growth in general, it was later shown that
IL-2 deficiency hardly altered the development and function
of T cells (14, 15). IL-2 deficiency in mice, however,
produced fatal lymphoproliferative inflammatory disease,
termed “IL-2 deficiency syndrome,” which is manifested by
inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia,
splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and multi-organ lympho-
cytic infiltration (1, 2). CD25 or CD122 (IL-2R
 

 
) defi-
ciency also produced similar lethal immunopathology (16,
17). Despite the ability of IL-2 to induce activation-induced
cell death in T cells including self-reactive T cells (18), the
IL-2 deficiency syndrome is not a T cell–autonomous dis-
ease. For example, IL-2 deficiency substantially reduced nat-
ural CD25 CD4 T reg cells (19), and transfer of CD25
CD4 T cells suppressed IL-2/ T cell proliferation (20). In
addition, inoculation of IL-2–replete spleen cells or thy-
mocytes delayed the onset of multi-organ immunopathology
in IL-2/ mice (21). Furthermore, there is in vivo and in
vitro evidence that IL-2 is required for functional activation
of T reg cells (22–24). Despite these findings supporting the
vital contribution of IL-2 to the development and function
of natural T reg cells, it is still unclear whether IL-2 is re-
quired for the thymic generation or peripheral expansion/
survival of natural T reg cells. It is also obscure whether IL-2
deficiency in normal animals can cause T cell–mediated au-
toimmune diseases, such as T1D, thyroiditis, and gastritis,
similar to those produced in normal mice by depletion of
natural T reg cells (8).
In this report, we have further investigated the role of
IL-2 in self-tolerance and autoimmune disease, in particular,
how IL-2 neutralization affects natural CD25 CD4 T reg
cells in normal mice and whether this can cause or enhance
autoimmune disease in genetically normal or autoimmune-
prone mice. We show that (a) IL-2 is essential for physiologi-
cal expansion and survival of natural CD25 CD4 T reg
cells in the periphery, (b) CD25low CD4 T cells, which ap-
pear to include self-reactive T cells, physiologically sustain
this proliferation/survival of CD25 CD4 natural T reg cells
by secreting IL-2, and (c) IL-2 neutralization for a limited pe-
riod can impair this feedback control, reduce natural T reg
cells, and elicit T cell–mediated autoimmune disease in nor-
mal mice. Furthermore, in genetically autoimmune-prone
mice, the treatment enhances predisposed autoimmunity and
produces other autoimmune diseases de novo. Thus, IL-2 is a
cytokine crucially required for homeostatic maintenance of
natural CD25 CD4 T reg cells. Genetic anomaly or envi-
ronmental perturbation of IL-2 formation, and for that matter
IL-2R expression and function, can be a cause and also a key
predisposing factor for autoimmune disease.
RESULTS
Neutralization of IL-2 by a specific mAb selectively reduces 
CD25 CD4 T cells in normal mice
CD25 CD4 CD8 cells in the thymus and spleen of nor-
mal naive mice constitutively expressed IL-2R (CD122) as
well as IL-2Rc chain (CD132), whereas CD25 CD4
CD8 cells expressed only the latter, indicating that CD25
CD4 T cells constitutively express the high affinity IL-2R
even in the thymus (Fig. 1 A).
To determine the effects of IL-2 neutralization on the
composition of CD25 or CD25 CD4 T cells in the thy-
mus and the periphery, we i.v. administered 1 mg of neutral-
izing anti–IL-2 mAb to normal BALB/c mice and assessed
the number of CD25 or CD25 CD4 CD8 thymocytes/T
cells. The treatment reduced the percentages and absolute
numbers of CD25 CD4 T cells (Fig. 1 B) and GITRhigh
CD4 T cells (Fig. S1, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/
content/full/jem.20041982/DC1) in the thymus, spleen, and
lymph nodes (not depicted), confirming a previous result by
others for splenocytes (25). Reduction was significant from 3 d
after anti–IL-2 injection for nearly 2 mo, gradually recover-
ing to normal levels by 3 mo after treatment. Recovery in the
thymus was faster than in the periphery. In contrast, the treat-
ment did not significantly alter the number of CD25 CD4
T cells in the thymus and spleen.
Because IL-2 regulates the expression of CD25 (26), it is
possible that IL-2 neutralization might impair CD25 expres-
sion by CD25 CD4 T cells rather than reducing their cell
number. To examine this possibility, we assessed the expres-
sion levels of Foxp3 14 d after anti–IL-2 treatment (10, 27,
28). Splenic CD4 T cells purified from anti–IL-2–treated
mice exhibited significantly (3.4-fold; P  0.01) reduced
amounts of Foxp3 mRNA compared with those from con-
trol saline-treated mice (Fig. 1 C). CD4 CD8 thymocytes
from anti–IL-2–treated mice also showed reduced Foxp3
mRNA expression, but the reduction was not so marked as
in splenic CD4 T cells (2.2-fold; P  0.06), presumably
due to physiologically lower expression levels of 
 
Foxp3
 
 in
thymic CD25 CD4 CD8 thymocytes than in CD25
CD4 splenic T cells (Fig. S2 A, available at http://www.
jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20041982/DC1).
To determine then whether anti–IL-2 treatment reduces
natural T reg cells with autoimmune-preventive activity, we

transferred spleen cells from BALB/c mice 14 d after treat-
ment to syngeneic nude mice and examined possible devel-
opment of autoimmune disease (8). Fig. 1 D shows that all of
the recipients developed histologically and serologically evi-
dent autoimmune gastritis, whereas nude mice cell trans-
ferred from control BALB/c mice did not. In addition,
cotransfer of anti–IL-2–treated spleen cells with CD25
CD4 T cells from untreated normal animals inhibited the
development of gastritis.
Taken together, these results indicate that IL-2 neutral-
ization can selectively reduce the number of autoimmune-
preventive Foxp3-expressing natural CD25 CD4 T reg
cells in the immune system, especially in the periphery.
IL-2 is required for the maintenance of CD25 CD4 T reg 
cells in the periphery
To determine whether IL-2 neutralization affects the thy-
mic generation, peripheral maintenance (survival and/or
growth), or both, of CD25 CD4 T reg cells, we thymec-
tomized (Tx) 5–6-wk-old BALB/c mice and injected 1 mg
anti–IL-2 mAb or saline 3 wk later. 14 d after anti–IL-2
mAb treatment, the percentage and the number of CD25
CD4 T cells decreased equally in Tx and sham-Tx mice
(Fig. 2, A and B). This indicates that IL-2 neutralization re-
duces peripheral CD25 CD4 T reg cells whether there is a
thymic supply of T reg cells or not.
IL-2 is required for in vivo physiological proliferation of 
CD25 CD4 T cells, but not for their 
lymphopenia-driven expansion
Despite in vitro anergy of CD25 CD4 T reg cells, they
proliferate on transfer to lymphopenic mice (29, 30). Fur-
thermore, in normal nonlymphopenic mice, peripheral
CD25 CD4 T cells show more active proliferation than
CD25 CD4 T cells in the physiological state (Fig. 3 A; ref-
erences 9, 31, and 32). Based on these findings, we first de-
termined whether IL-2 neutralization in normal nonlym-
phopenic mice blocked natural proliferation of CD25
CD4 T cells. Normal BALB/c mice were injected with
anti–IL-2 mAb or saline and subsequently with 1 mg
5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) every 12 h for 3 d. IL-2
neutralization reduced incorporation of BrdU in CD25
CD4 T cells to one third of control mice, with no reduc-
tion in CD25 CD4 T cells, indicating that CD25 CD4
T cells require IL-2 for their physiological proliferation in
the periphery (Fig. 3, A and B).
To determine then whether IL-2 is also essential for lym-
phopenia-driven expansion of CD25 CD4 T cells, we
transferred highly purified (	99%) 5- and 6-carboxyfluores-
cein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled CD25
CD4 T cells from BALB/c-Thy1.1 congenic mice to
BALB/c–RAG-2/ recipients and treated them with anti–
IL-2 mAb to exclude a possible contribution of IL-2 derived
from the host (for example, produced by the host DCs; ref-
erence 33) or transferred CD25 CD4 T cells themselves.

percentages of CD25 CD4 T cells among the CD4 T cells (A) and their 
absolute numbers (B) were determined on day 14 after antibody injection.

Assessment 4 d later revealed that transferred Thy1.1 T cells
had vigorously proliferated, and this proliferation was not af-
fected by anti–IL-2 (Fig. 4 A). This IL-2–independent pro-
liferation was further confirmed by a similar level of pro-
liferation of CD25 CD4 T cells transferred to BALB/
c–RAG-2/ IL-2/ mice (not depicted). Furthermore, when
these recipient mice were examined 4 wk later, the number
of Thy1.1 splenic T cells was not significantly different among
the recipients, whether they were IL-2/ or IL-2/, co-
transferred with CD25 CD4 T cells or not, or treated with
anti–IL-2 or saline (Fig. 4 B).
Taken together, these results indicate that IL-2 is an in-
dispensable growth factor for physiological proliferation and
survival of CD25 CD4 T reg cells in normal nonlym-
phopenic conditions but dispensable for lymphopenia-induced
homeostatic expansion or survival.
IL-2 transcription is confined to CD25low CD4 nonregulatory 
T cells in normal naive mice
Next, we attempted to determine which cells produce the IL-2
required for the growth/survival of CD25 CD4 T reg cells in
normal naive nonlymphopenic mice. We quantitatively as-
sessed IL-2 mRNA expression by real-time PCR in various
cell populations prepared from the spleens of normal naive
BALB/c mice. The analyzed populations included macro-
phages (CD11b), DCs (CD11chigh MHCII), B cells
(CD19), NKT cells (TCR -GalCer/CD1d-tetramer),
NK cells (DX5 TCR), CD8 T cells and CD4 T cells,
which were sorted to CD25, CD25low, and CD25high cells
(Fig. 5 A). High IL-2 transcription was detected in CD4 T
cells, especially CD25low CD4 T cells, and to lesser degrees in
NKT, NK, and CD8 T cells. In accord with this, CD25low
CD4 T cells secreted IL-2 in significantly higher amounts than
CD25high or CD25 CD4 T cells during 24 h in vitro culture
(Fig. 5 A). Similar results were obtained with DO11.10 TCR
transgenic mice. CD25low CD4 T cells showed an approxi-
mately five- or twofold higher transcription of IL-2 than
CD25high or CD25 CD4 T cells, respectively, whereas CD4
T cells from RAG/ DO11.10 mice, which lack CD25
CD4 T reg cells (34), scarcely transcribed the gene (Fig. 5 B).
This CD25low CD4 population was mainly composed of KJ1-
26negative-low T cells similar to CD25high CD4 T cells, indicating
that CD25low CD4 T cells expressed endogenous TCR 
chains paired with transgenic TCR  chains. In contrast to IL-2
transcription, Foxp3 expression was higher (approximately
threefold) in the CD25high population than in the CD25low
CD4 population in BALB/c mice and DO11.10 transgenic
mice, exhibiting an inverse correlation between IL-2 and
Foxp3 expression (Fig. 5 C; reference 10). Furthermore, consis-
tent with their low Foxp3 expression status, CD25low CD4 T
cells failed to suppress the anti-CD3–driven proliferation of
CD25 CD4 T cells in vitro, contrasting with potent suppres-
sion by CD25high CD4 T cells (Fig. 5 D). Notably, however,
not only CD25high but also CD25low CD4 T cells proliferated
poorly upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 5 D). Judging from
low level expression of Foxp3 by CD25low CD4 T cells (10-
fold less than CD25high cells), their hypo-responsiveness could
be attributed to suppression by a small number of contaminat-
ing Foxp3high CD25high T reg cells due to the limit of fidelity in
cell sorting. Alternatively, Foxp3low CD25low CD4 T cells
themselves might be hypoproliferative but not suppressive.
Likewise, small amounts of IL-2 mRNA detected in the
CD25high or CD25 fraction could be due to contaminating IL-
2–secreting CD25low cells or production of a small amount of
IL-2 by these populations.
CD25low CD4 CD8 thymocytes were present in the
thymus of normal naive mice and expressed Foxp3 mRNA
at levels one third of thymic CD25high CD4 T cells (Fig. S2

fer of an equal number (3  105) of CD25 CD4 T cells and CD25 CD4 
T cells sorted from the lymph nodes of normal BALB/c mice. The numbers 
of Thy1.1 TCR cells recovered in the spleen of individual recipients

mocytes were, however, much lower than the levels of the
peripheral counterpart and equivalent to those of CD25high
CD4 CD8 thymocytes (Fig. S2 B). In addition, in contrast
with splenic CD25low CD4 T cells, which were higher in
CD44 expression than peripheral CD25high or CD25 CD4
T cells, CD25low CD4 CD8 thymocytes were intermediate
in CD44 expression between CD25high and CD25 CD4
thymocytes (Fig. S2 C). These data indicate that splenic
CD25low CD4 T cells are activated in the periphery and
therefore actively transcribe IL-2.

normal naive mice is functionally heterogeneous, containing
activated nonregulatory CD25low T cells, which might be the
main source of IL-2 in normal naive mice. Assuming that
CD25 CD4 T cells that express endogenous TCR 
chains in TCR transgenic mice are more self-reactive than
other T cells (34), such CD25low CD4 T cells might be
more self-reactive than CD25 CD4 T cells and therefore
activated by self-antigens in the physiological state and ac-
tively forming IL-2.
Induction of autoimmune gastritis in BALB/c mice by anti–
IL-2 mAb treatment
Based on the result that anti–IL-2 mAb administration re-
duced the number of functional T reg cells (Fig. 1), we ex-
amined whether autoimmune disease would develop in nor-
mal BALB/c mice after anti–IL-2 mAb injection on days 10
and 20 after birth. Such treatment indeed induced by 3 mo
of age histologically evident gastritis accompanying the ap-
pearance of anti-parietal cell autoantibodies in the circula-
tion (Fig. 6, A and B). Furthermore, splenocytes from gastri-
tis-bearing BALB/c mice adoptively transferred gastritis to
BALB/c athymic nude mice, indicating that the lesion was a
bona fide T cell–mediated autoimmune disease (Fig. 6 C).
This anti–IL-2 mAb treatment of young mice signifi-
cantly reduced the number of CD25 CD4 T cells for
nearly 2 mo. The number gradually recovered to the control
level by 3 mo after treatment (Fig. S3 A, available at http://
www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20041982/DC1), simi-
lar to the result with adult mice (Fig. 1 B). The recovered
CD25 CD4 T cells were equally anergic and exhibited
comparative degrees of suppressive activity and similar levels
of Foxp3 mRNA expression as those from control mice (Fig.
S3, B and C), indicating that the majority of them were T
reg cells but not activated autoimmune T cells. Thus, IL-2
neutralization and the resulting transient T reg cell defi-
ciency is sufficient to elicit autoimmune disease in otherwise
normal mice.
Induction of a wide spectrum of organ-specific autoimmune 
diseases including autoimmune neuritis in nonobese diabetic 
(NOD) mice by IL-2 neutralization
Diabetes-prone NOD mice are known to be genetically sus-
ceptible to other organ-specific autoimmune diseases such as
thyroiditis and sialadenitis (35, 36). Therefore, we examined
whether neutralization of IL-2 would exacerbate diabetes
and produce autoimmune disease in a wider spectrum of
organs compared with nontreated NOD mice. A similar
course of anti–IL-2 treatment as shown in Fig. 6 for BALB/c
mice triggered an earlier onset of diabetes, resulting in a
higher incidence of diabetes (Fig. 7 A) and more severe
forms of insulitis at the time of examination (Fig. 7, B and
C). Furthermore, the incidence and histological severity of
gastritis and thyroiditis increased in these anti–IL-2–treated
mice. Histologically evident gastritis and thyroiditis in the
treated mice was 90.9 and 54.5%, respectively, compared
with 0% in control NOD mice at 20 wk of age (Fig. 7, B, D,
and E, and see Fig. 9). These mice with gastritis or thyroidi-
tis developed high titers of anti-parietal cell or anti-thyroglo-
bulin autoantibodies, respectively (Fig. 7, D and E). Histo-
logically evident inflammation in lacrimal glands and salivary
glands was also observed in 36.4 and 9%, respectively, of
anti–IL-2–treated NOD mice but absent in control mice
(Fig. 7 B and see Fig. 9).
Notably, some mice developed ataxia and paralysis of the
limbs around 15 wk after anti–IL-2 treatment (Fig. 8, A and
B). Histological examination of the nervous system revealed
lymphocytic infiltration and demyelination in peripheral
nerves (Fig. 8 C) but not in the central nervous system (not
depicted). Anti–IL-2 treatment elicited neuropathy in 56.3%
of NOD mice and triggered diabetes in 50% of NOD mice
assessed at 3 mo of age. Interestingly, neuropathy and diabe-
tes were apparently mutually exclusive: only 1 of 11 mice
developed both diseases (Fig. 9). The peripheral neuropathy
could be adoptively transferred to naive NOD.SCID mice
by spleen cell suspensions from neuropathic NOD mice.
Both CD4 and CD4 T cells from neuropathic NOD mice
induced histologically evident neuritis in the SCID recipi-
ents (100% by CD4 T cells and 40% by CD4 T cells), ac-
companying clinical signs of neuropathy such as trembling
limbs (80% by CD4 T cells and 40% by CD4 T cells; Fig.
8, D and E).
Thus, anti–IL-2 mAb treatment enhances diabetes and

produces a wide spectrum of organ-specific autoimmune
diseases and most notably, peripheral neuritis in autoim-
mune-prone NOD mice.
DISCUSSION
The following findings in this report support IL-2 being crit-
ically required for the peripheral maintenance of natural
CD25 CD4 T reg cells and consequently the immunologic
self-tolerance sustained by them. First, injection of anti–IL-2
mAb to Tx mice resulted in a marked reduction of the num-
ber of peripheral CD25 CD4 T cells, which corresponded
to Foxp3-expressing natural T reg cells. The number of
CD4 T cells expressing high levels of GITR, which is more
stably expressed by Foxp3-expressing natural T reg cells than
CD25 (37), was also reduced after anti–IL-2 neutralization
(Fig. S1), supporting the reduction of T reg cells rather than
conversion of T reg cells from CD25 to CD25. Second,
neutralization of IL-2 in normal mice inhibited the physio-
logical proliferation of peripheral CD25 CD4 T cells.
Third, IL-2 neutralization in normal mice for a limited pe-
riod induced autoimmune disease similar to the one pro-
duced by depletion of CD25 CD4 T reg cells. Further-
more, transfer of spleen cells from BALB/c mice with low
numbers of CD4 T cells expressing CD25 and Foxp3 after
anti–IL-2 treatment produced in nude mice autoimmune dis-
eases similar to those seen after the transfer of CD25 cell–
depleted BALB/c spleen cells, and cotransfer of normal
CD25 CD4 T cells prevented the autoimmune develop-
ment (8). Taken together, these findings indicate passive cell
death of CD25 CD4 T reg cells as a major mechanism of T
reg cell reduction upon IL-2 deprivation, although our results
do not exclude the possibility that IL-2 neutralization may re-

duce CD25 expression by natural T reg cells, thereby impair-
ing their activation or down-regulating their Foxp3 transcrip-
tion, leading to the attenuation of their suppressive activity.
Previous studies with IL-2/ or IL-2R/ mice also
demonstrated a critical role for IL-2 and IL-2R in homeosta-
sis of peripheral CD25 CD4 T reg cells. For example, not
only IL-2/ mice but also IL-2R/ mice bear few
CD25 CD4 T cells in the thymus and periphery (19, 38).
In chimeric RAG-2/ mice reconstituted with IL-2/ and
CD25/ BW cells, the normal number of peripheral
CD25 CD4 T cells was established solely from IL-2/
BM cells (39). This indicates that IL-2 produced by CD25/
cells promoted the differentiation of IL-2/ T cells to T
reg cells. In IL-2R/ mice, the number of CD25 CD4

T cells was restored in the thymus and the periphery by thy-
mic expression of an IL-2R transgene, indicating a critical
role of the IL-2/IL-2R pathway for the thymic generation
of CD25 CD4 T cells (38). Thus, our present results, to-
gether with these findings by others, indicate that IL-2 is
crucially required for the maintenance of peripheral CD25
CD4 T reg cells. IL-2 may also be required for the activa-
tion of CD25 CD4 T reg cells to exert suppression (23). It
is likely that severe inflammation/autoimmunity in IL-2/,
CD25/, or CD122/ mice could be attributed to a syn-
ergistic effect of the reduction of natural T reg cells and their
impaired function and differentiation in addition to possible
altered activation-induced cell death of self-reactive T cells.
In contrast to the requirement of IL-2 for physiological
expansion of CD25 CD4 T reg cells in normal nonlym-
phopenic mice, homeostatic proliferation in a lymphopenic
environment appears to be IL-2 independent. It has been
shown that CD25 CD4 T cells as well as conventional
CD25 CD4 T cells undergo extensive homeostatic expan-
sion when transferred into lymphopenic recipients (29, 30). It
is therefore likely that strong TCR stimulation of CD25
CD4 T reg cells by self-peptide/MHC, together with co-
stimulation via CD28, may suffice to sustain their homeostatic
proliferation in a T cell–deficient environment. It may corre-
spond to the finding that TCR and CD28 costimulation can
abrogate the anergic state of CD25 CD4 T reg cells and
evoke their proliferation in vitro, as TCR stimulation in the
presence of high dose IL-2 has a similar in vitro effect (40, 41).
We have shown that splenic CD25 CD4 T cells are
phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous and can be
divided to two functionally distinct populations according to
the level of CD25 expression: one is the CD25high popula-
tion, which exhibits suppressive activity, expresses a high
level of Foxp3, and produces little IL-2, the other being the
CD25low population, which has little suppressive activity, ex-
presses a low level of Foxp3, and produces IL-2. The CD25
CD4 T cell population thus contains both CD25low CD4
activated non–T reg cells and Foxp3-expressing CD25high
CD4 T reg cells. TCR transgenic mice also harbor IL-
2–transcribing Foxp3low CD25low CD4 T cells, whereas
RAG/ TCR transgenic mice did not. These findings col-
lectively indicate the following. First, some of the IL-2–tran-
scribing CD25low CD4 T cells might be activated by self-
antigens because this population in TCR transgenic mice
predominantly expresses endogenous TCR  chains paired
with transgenic  chains and appears to be positively selected
because of high self-reactivity of such TCRs, similar to posi-
tive selection of CD25high CD4 T reg cells (34). Second, the
presence of activated CD25low CD4 non–T reg cells within
the CD25 CD4 T cell population explains the finding by
others that CD25 CD4 T cells isolated from normal naive
mice were able to induce colitis when transferred to SCID
mice and subsequently treated with anti–IL-10R mAb (42).
Such colitis-inducing CD25 CD4 T cells may well have
contained pathogenic CD25low CD4 T cells in addition to
CD25 CD4 T reg cells, and the IL-10R blockade may
have abrogated the suppression exerted by the latter, allow-
ing the former to cause colitis. Third, our results substantiate
the finding in humans and mice that the CD25high CD4
population predominantly contains T reg cells (43, 44).
Thus, assuming that CD25low CD4 T cells secrete IL-2 in
the physiological state by responding to self-antigens or
commensal bacteria, IL-2 can be a mediator of negative
feedback control by which activated CD25low CD4 nonreg-
ulatory T cells contribute to the maintenance and activation
of natural CD25 CD4 T reg cells, which in turn limit the
expansion of the former. This may occur locally where both
natural T reg cells and effector T cells are recruited to APCs
presenting particular self- or nonself-antigens.
IL-2 neutralization enhanced autoimmunity in NOD
mice presumably by reducing natural CD25 CD4 T reg
cells. The treatment facilitated the onset of T1D, produced
more severe insulitis with higher incidence of diabetes, and
provoked other autoimmune diseases in more severe a form
than control mice. Interestingly, anti–IL-2 mAb-treated
NOD mice also developed T cell–mediated autoimmune
neuropathy similar to the one that developed in B7-2–defi-
cient or anti–B7-2 mAb-treated NOD mice (45). It was
shown that treatment with pertussis toxin alone, which im-
pairs blood brain barrier, evoked EAE in NOD mice (46). In
addition, allelic variants of the IL-2 gene contribute to the
development of T1D and EAE in NOD congenic mice (6).
Taken together, it is likely in NOD mice that genetic varia-
tions of IL-2 may contribute to determining the genetic sus-

ceptibility to these autoimmune diseases by altering the
development and function of natural T reg cells (47). Fur-
thermore, such genetic variation/anomalies of IL-2 may
cause different autoimmune disease in combination with
other genes (47, 48), as illustrated by the development of au-
toimmune gastritis in BALB/c mice and autoimmune neu-
ropathy and other autoimmune diseases in NOD mice (9).
In conclusion, IL-2 is an indispensable cytokine for the
peripheral maintenance of natural CD25 CD4 T reg cells.
Alteration in the formation of IL-2 by other T cells, structural
abnormality of the IL-2 molecule itself (49), or anomalies in
intracellular signal transduction through IL-2R (50–52) might
be predisposing to, or even causative of, various autoimmune
diseases (6, 53). Furthermore, not only genetic modification
but also environmental alteration of IL-2 formation may cause
autoimmune disease. For example, cyclosporin A can cause
autoimmune disease similar to the one produced by IL-2 neu-
tralization, presumably by inhibiting IL-2 formation and con-
sequently reducing natural CD25 CD4 T reg cells or im-
pairing their functions (54). On the other hand, IL-2 can be
used for strengthening natural self-tolerance and preventing
autoimmune disease or stabilizing transplantation tolerance by
maintaining the survival/expansion and augmenting the sup-
pressive activity of natural T reg cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice. BALB/c, BALB/c athymic nude, C.B-17 SCID, NOD, and
NOD.SCID mice were purchased from CLEA. IL-2–deficient mice were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and backcrossed to BALB/c mice
more than eight times. BALB/c-Thy1.1 congenic mice were established in
our laboratory (55). DO.11.10 TCR transgenic mice and RAG-2–deficient
BALB/c mice were provided by D. Loh (Washington University, St. Louis,
MO) and Y. Shinkai (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan), respectively. All
mice were maintained in our animal facility and treated in accordance with
the guidelines for animal care approved by the Institute for Frontier Medical
Sciences, Kyoto University.
Reagents. The rat anti–IL-2 mAb (IgG2a, clone S4B6; reference 56) was
purified from ascites using protein G columns (Amersham Biosciences). The
following reagents were purchased from BD Biosciences: purified anti-CD3
(145-2C11), anti-CD16/CD32 (2.4G2), and anti–IL-2R (TM-1); and
FITC-labeled or biotinylated anti-CD25 (7D4), FITC–anti-CD4 (RM4-5),
PE–anti-CD4 (H129.19), FITC–anti-CD19 (1D3), PE–anti-CD11c (HL3),
PE–anti-CD8 (53–6.7), PE–anti-Thy1.1 (OX-7), PE–anti-CD122 (TM-
1), and PE–anti-CD132 (4G3). PE–anti-CD3 (145-2C11), PE–anti-
CD11b (M1/70), and PE–anti-pan NK cells (DX-5) were purchased from
eBioscience. -GalCer (KRN7000) was provided by Kirin Brewery Co.
-GalCer/CD1d tetramer was provided by H. Wakasugi and Y. Ikarashi
(National Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan). Anti-GITR mAb (DTA-1) was
produced, purified, and labeled with Alexa in our laboratory (57).
Preparation of lymphocytes, flow cytometry, and cell sorting.
Lymphocyte suspensions were prepared from thymi, spleens, and lymph
nodes. Erythrocytes were lysed with ACK buffer. Thymic CD4 CD8 and
CD8 cells were depleted by treatment with anti-CD8 mAb (3.155) and
rabbit complement (Cedarlane Laboratories). For flow cytometric analysis,
106 cells were incubated with FITC- or PE-labeled or biotinylated mAbs and
then with CyChrome- or PE-streptavidin (BD Biosciences) as a secondary
reagent for biotinylated antibodies. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytom-
etry (Epics-XL; Beckman Coulter). To sort peripheral CD4 T cell subpop-
ulations, CD4 T cells were first enriched by depleting B cells, CD8 cells,
and adherent cells by panning as described previously (8). After staining with
fluorescent antibodies, cells were sorted by an Epics Altra cell sorter (Beck-
man Coulter). The purity of the resulting CD25 or CD25 CD4 popula-
tion was 99%. In some experiments, CD25 CD4 T cells were purified
using the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec). The enriched CD4 T cell frac-
tion was stained with biotinylated anti-CD25 followed by streptavidin PE.
Cells were then labeled with anti-PE microbeads and passed through LS col-
umns twice to obtain CD25 cells. The purity of the resulting CD25 CD4
T cells was 90–95%.
Histology and serology. Organs were fixed with 10% formalin and pro-
cessed for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Autoantibodies specific for the
gastric parietal cells and thyroglobulin were assayed by ELISA (8). Gastritis
and thyroiditis were graded 0–2 as described previously (8).
Real-time PCR. Foxp3 or IL-2 mRNA levels were quantified by using
real-time PCR as described previously (10). IL-2 primer sequences used in
this study were: 5-tccagaacatgccgcagag-3 and 5-cctgagcaggatggagaattaca-
3. The IL-2 probe used was 5-FAM-actccccaggatgctcaccttcaaattt-3. The
primers were designed to hybridize on an intron–exon junction to prevent
amplification of contaminating genomic DNA.
ELISA. Purified CD25high, CD25low, and CD25 CD4 T cells (8.5  105
per well in a flat-bottomed 96-well plate) were cultured in 80 
l of com-
plete RPMI medium for 24 h. To block the binding of IL-2 to IL-2R on
these populations, 10 
g/ml anti–IL-2R was added in the culture. IL-2
concentration in culture supernatants was determined by sandwich ELISA
(eBioscience), which has a detection limit of 2 pg/ml.
In vitro proliferation assay. Sorted CD25 CD4 cells (2.0  104 per
well in a U-bottomed 96-well plate) and 4.0  104 irradiated APCs per well
were cultured for 72 h in the presence of 1.0 
g/ml anti-CD3 mAb (145-
2C11; BD Biosciences). CD3 cell–depleted spleen cells were used as
APCs. [3H]thymidine (1 
Ci/well; DuPont/NEN Life Science Products)
was added during the last 6 h of culture. Background counts in the wells
with APCs alone were always 200 cpm (40).
In vivo BrdU labeling. Mice were injected i.p. with 1.0 mg BrdU
(Sigma-Aldrich) every 12 h for 3 d. 107 pooled LN and spleen cells were
surface stained with PE-CD4 and biotin-CD25 followed by RPE-Cy5-
streptavidin (DakoCytomation). BrdU staining was performed as reported
by others (58) using FITC-labeled anti-BrdU mAb (DakoCytomation).
Lymphocyte labeling with CFSE. Purified CD25 CD4 T cells were
incubated with 3 
M CFSE in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. An
equal volume of normal mouse serum was then added to stop the reaction.
After washing twice, 106 labeled cells were i.v. injected.
Thymectomy. Female 5–6-wk-old mice were anesthetized by 10% nem-
butal and Tx or sham operated as previously described (8).
Assessment of diabetes. Blood glucose levels were measured every week
with a Medisafe reader (TERUMO). Mice were considered diabetic when
blood glucose levels were 	300 mg/dl after two consecutive measurements.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed by Student’s
paired t test.
