Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, in combination with genotyping of the Staphy-
lococcus aureus chromosome, has become essential for deﬁning methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) clones
in epidemiological studies. We have developed a convenient system for SCCmec type assignment. The system
consists of six multiplex PCRs (M-PCRs) for identifying the ccr gene complex (ccr), the mec gene complex
(mec), and speciﬁc structures in the junkyard (J) regions: M-PCR with primer set 1 (M-PCR 1) identiﬁed ﬁve
types of ccr genes; M-PCR 2 identiﬁed class A to class C mec; M-PCRs 3 and 4 identiﬁed speciﬁc open reading
frames in the J1 regions of type I and IV and of type II, III, and V SCCmec elements, respectively; M-PCR 5
identiﬁed the transposons Tn554 and Tn554 integrated into the J2 regions of type II and III SCCmec
elements; and M-PCR 6 identiﬁed plasmids pT181 and pUB110 integrated into J3 regions. The system was
validated with 99 MRSA strains carrying SCCmec elements of different types. The SCCmec types of 93 out of
the 99 MRSA strains could be assigned. The SCCmec type assignments were identical to those made with a
PCR system that uses numerous primer pairs to identify genes or gene alleles. Our system of six M-PCRs is
thus a convenient and reliable method for typing SCCmec elements.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains
have become prevalent in health care facilities and in the
community worldwide (3, 4). MRSA strains produce penicillin
binding protein 2 or 2a, which is poorly acylated by -lactam
antibiotics (5, 22, 25). The mecA gene, encoding PBP2a, is
carried on a peculiar type of mobile genetic element inserted
into the staphylococcal chromosome, designated staphylococ-
cal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements (12, 14, 24).
SCCmec elements typically share four characteristics: ﬁrst,
they carry the mec gene complex (mec) consisting of the meth-
icillin resistance determinant mecA and its regulatory genes
and insertion sequences; second, they carry the ccr gene com-
plex (ccr) consisting of ccr genes that are responsible for the
mobility of the element and its surrounding sequences;
third, they have characteristic directly repeated nucleotide
sequences and inverted complementary sequences at both
ends; and last, they integrate into the 3 end of an open
reading frame (ORF), orfX.
Despite these similarities, the structures of SCCmec ele-
ments are rather divergent. Allotypic differences that are used
for SCCmec type deﬁnitions have been identiﬁed in both ccr
and mec. Five types of ccr and four classes of mec have been
reported. ccr types 1 to 4 carry the ccrA and ccrB genes, which
share approximately 80% identity with each other, and the type
5 ccr carries the ccrC gene (10, 11, 17, 19). Four classes of the
mec gene complexes have been identiﬁed among methicillin-
resistant staphylococcal strains of various species: class A mec,
consisting of IS431mec-mecA-mecR1-mecI; class B mec, con-
sisting of IS431mec-mecA-mecR1-IS1272; class C mec, con-
sisting of IS431mec-mecA-mecR1-IS431; and class D mec,
consisting of IS431mec-mecA-mecR1 with no insertion se-
quences downstream of mecR1 identiﬁed by PCR as of yet
(13). In S. aureus strains, mec classes A, B, and C have been
identiﬁed. Insertion sequences have sometimes been found
to be integrated in or around the class A mec. A class A mec
carrying IS431 downstream of mecI was found in Staphylo-
coccus haemolyticus (13). Recently, Shore et al. identiﬁed
MRSA strains carrying class A mec with an insertion of
IS1182 in and around the mecI gene and designated them
classes A3 and A4 (23).
The SCCmec element type has been deﬁned by the com-
bination of ccr type and mec class. In MRSA strains, six
types of SCCmec elements, that is, six combinations of ccr
and mec, have been reported (Table 1). These six SCCmec
elements have been further classiﬁed by differences in re-
gions other than ccr and mec, which are designated junkyard
(J) regions. The J regions comprise three parts: J1 (the
region between ccr and the right-ﬂanking chromosomal re-
gion), J2 (the region between mec and ccr), and J3 (the
region between orfX and mec). The J regions are not always
speciﬁc to each SCCmec type, but certain J regions are
commonly shared among certain types of SCCmec elements.
Of the three regions, we regard J1 as being the most fun-
damental, because we presume that it reﬂects the original

form of SCC into which a mec gene complex integrated.
Moreover, several different J1 regions have been identiﬁed
in type II and type IV SCCmec elements (7, 15, 17, 20, 23).
The presence or absence of integrated plasmids encoding
drug resistance genes in the J3 regions of SCCmec elements
can also be used as markers to classify SCCmec elements
further in epidemiological studies (1, 19).
In this study, we describe a convenient and reliable method
for SCCmec typing based on a set of multiplex PCRs (M-
PCRs). In this system, M-PCRs 1 and 2 are used for SCCmec
type assignment; M-PCR 3 or M-PCR 4 is used for J1 region
difference-based subtyping, and M-PCRs 5 and 6 are used for
the identiﬁcation of integrated copies of transposons (Tn554 or
Tn554) and plasmids (pUB110 or pT181).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains. Twelve MRSA strains were used as standard strains for
SCCmec typing (Table 1). In addition, 99 MRSA strains were used to validate the
multiplex PCR, including 78 strains isolated in the United States, Canada, Ire-
land, England, and Egypt from 1960 through 1993 (including 8 strains with no
record of their origin) provided by B. N. Kreiswirth (note that these strains were
included in the study by Pfaller et al. [21]); 10 strains isolated in France in 1996,
provided by J. Etienne; and 11 strains isolated in the United States and Australia,
as reported previously by Okuma et al. (18).
Nomenclature of SCCmec elements. In this paper, we use our proposed nomen-
clature for SCCmec elements (2). As shown in Table 1, the SCCmec element type
(deﬁned by the combination of ccr and mec allotypes) is indicated with roman
numerals, while the SCCmec element subtype (deﬁned by differences in the junkyard
regions) is indicated with Arabic numbers separated by a period, where each number
indicates the structure of the J regions (J1, J2, and J3, respectively) according to the
chronological priority of the description. It should be noted that the description of
the J regions has been modiﬁed from our original proposal according to the sug-
gestion of Kunyan Zhang (Calgary University, Canada).
M-PCRs. Chromosomal DNA was extracted from MRSA strains by using the
small-scale phenol extraction method and was used as a template (8).
The primer pairs used for PCR experiments are listed in Table 2. M-PCR 1 for
ccr type assignment contained two primers to identify mecA and eight primers
used for the identiﬁcation of ﬁve ccr genes: four primers including a common
forward primer (common to ccrB1-3) and three reverse primers speciﬁc for
ccrA1, ccrA2, and ccrA3 for identifying ccr1-3 based on the differences in ccrA
genes; two primers for identifying ccr4; and two primers for identifying ccr5.
M-PCR 2 for mec class assignment contained four primers to identify the gene
lineages of mecA-mecI (class A mec), mecA-IS1272 (class B mec), and mecA-
IS431(class C mec). M-PCR 3 contained ﬁve primer pairs: one pair for identi-
fying speciﬁc ORF in the J1 region of type I SCCmec elements and four pairs for
identifying speciﬁc ORFs in the J1 regions of four subtypes of type IV SCCmec

elements. M-PCR 4 contained six primer pairs: four pairs for identifying speciﬁc
ORFs in J1 regions of four subtypes of type II SCCmec elements, one pair for
identifying speciﬁc ORFs in the J1 region of type III SCCmec elements, and one
pair for identifying speciﬁc ORFs in the J1 region of type V SCCmec elements.
M-PCR 5 contained three primers: one primer speciﬁc to the J2 regions of type
II and type III SCCmec elements and two primers speciﬁc to ermA and cadB,
respectively, to identify the J2 regions of type II or type III SCCmec elements.
M-PCR 6 contained three primers: one primer speciﬁc for mecA and two primers
speciﬁc for ant(4) in plasmid pUB110 and tetK in plasmid pT181, respectively,
to identify integrated plasmids in the J3 regions.
For M-PCR 1, reaction mixtures contained 10 ng chromosomal DNA, oligo-
nucleotide primers (0.1 M), 200 M each deoxynucleotide triphosphates, Ex
Taq buffer, and 2.5 U Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Kyoto, Japan) in a
ﬁnal volume of 50 l. The concentration of MgCl2 was 3.2 mM. A Takara PCR
thermal cycler was used for ampliﬁcation with an initial denaturation step (94°C,
2 min); 30 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 2 min), annealing (57°C, 1 min), and
extension (72°C, 2 min); and a ﬁnal elongation step at 72°C for 2 min. For
M-PCRs 2 to 5, the reaction mixtures were the same as those for M-PCR 1
except that the concentration of MgCl2 was 2 mM and the annealing temperature
was raised to 60°C for 1 min to avoid the generation of nonspeciﬁc DNA
fragments. For M-PCR 6, we performed long-range PCR using the Expand High
Fidelity PCR system according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Roche
Diagnostics Co., Indianapolis, IN). Brieﬂy, reactions were performed using a
ﬁnal reaction mixture volume of 50 l, which contained 10 ng template DNA,
oligonucleotide primers (0.3 M), 200 l each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 1
Expand High Fidelity buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 2.6 U Expand High Fidelity
PCR system enzyme mix. The PCR consisted of a denaturation step (94°C, 2
min); 10 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 15 s), annealing (50°C, 30 s), and extension
(68°C, 8 min); 20 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 15 s), annealing (50°C, 30 s), and
extension (68°C, 12 min); and a ﬁnal elongation step (72°C, 7 min).
PCRs for the identiﬁcation of SCCmercury and customary (nonmultiplexed)
PCRs to identify pls were carried out with the primer pairs listed in Table 2
according to a previously described procedure (10). PCR products were visual-
ized by agarose gel electrophoresis.
PCR-based identiﬁcation and determination of part of the nucleotide se-
quence of the type II.4 SCCmec element. DNA fragments encompassing the
entire SCCmec element of strain RN7170 were ampliﬁed by long-range PCR
using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system under the same conditions as those
used for M-PCR 6. The primer sets used for amplifying the DNA fragments are
given in Table 2. The amplicon sizes estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis are
as follows: the region from orfX to mecA, ampliﬁed with primers cR1 and mA3,
was 11 kb; the region from mecA to ermA in Tn554, ampliﬁed with primers mA2
and ermA1, was 11 kb; the region from ermA in Tn554 to ccr, ampliﬁed with
primers ermA3 and 2AJ1, was 12 kb; and the region from ccr to the right-ﬂanking
chromosomal region, ampliﬁed with primers c and cL4, was 15 kb. The loca-
tions of the primers are indicated in Fig. 1. PCR products were puriﬁed with the
QIAquick PCR puriﬁcation kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), and nucleotide
sequences of the DNA fragments from ccr to the right-ﬂanking chromosomal
region were determined by primer walking.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Development of two M-PCRs for ccr and mec components of
SCCmec elements. M-PCR 1 was developed to identify ccrC
and ccr4 in addition to three ccr types that could be identiﬁed
with previous systems (10). M-PCR 1 successfully ampliﬁed
DNA fragments corresponding in size to each ccr gene as
follows: type 1 ccr, 695 bp; type 2 ccr, 937 bp; type 3 ccr, 1,791
bp; type 4 ccr, 1,287 bp; and type 5 ccr, 518 bp (Table 2 and Fig.
2A). The 286-bp ampliﬁcation product appearing in each lane
represents mecA, the most essential gene in SCCmec, which is
used as an internal ampliﬁcation control. Two DNA fragments
of 518 bp and 1,791 bp were ampliﬁed with chromosomal DNA
of strain 85/2082, indicating that it carried both type 3 ccr and
ccrC, consistent with the fact that this strain carries two SCC
elements, a type III SCCmec (type 3 ccr) and an SCCmercury
(ccrC) (Table 1).
M-PCR 2, developed for assigning the mec class, contained
primer pairs for identifying mecA-mecI (class A), mecA-IS1272
(class B), and mecA-IS431 (class C), and it can replace the
three reactions used in traditional methods. The sizes of the
ampliﬁed DNA fragments matched the sizes expected for each
class of mec: 1,963 or 1,797 bp for mecA-mecI (class A), 2,827
bp for mecA-IS1272 (class B), and 804 bp for mecA-IS431
(class C) (Table 2 and Fig. 2B). The size of the ampliﬁed DNA
fragment obtained with strain 85/2082 was shorter than that
obtained with strain N315, in agreement with the fact that
mecR1 of 85/2082 has a 166-bp deletion relative to that in N315
(10). This case seems to be exceptional, because we success-
fully ampliﬁed DNA fragments of sizes similar to those of
N315 in 49 of 49 class A mec strains tested.
Development of two M-PCRs for J1 regions of SCCmec
elements. M-PCRs 3 and 4 were developed to identify speciﬁc
ORFs in the J1 region of each SCCmec element: M-PCR 3 for
type I and type IV SCCmec elements carrying class B mec and
M-PCR 4 for type II and type III SCCmec elements carrying
class A mec and type V SCCmec elements carrying class C mec.
With M-PCR 3, the J1 regions of all ﬁve SCCmec type I or
IV elements (type I.1, type IV.1, type IV.2, type IV.3, and type
IV.4) (Table 1) were identiﬁed with primer pairs speciﬁc for
each subtype. The sizes of the ampliﬁed DNA fragments
matched those predicted for the J1 regions of the ﬁve SCCmec
elements (type I.1, 154 bp; type IV.1, 458 bp; type IV.2, 726 bp;
type IV.3, 259 bp; type IV.4, 1,242 bp) (Fig. 2C and Table 2).
In this study, we identiﬁed a new subtype of type II SCCmec
elements carried by RN7170. By amplifying entire SCCmec
region and determining the nucleotide sequence of the J1
region of the element, we designated it type II.4 SCCmec.
Interestingly, the J1 region carried by type IIB, IIC, IID, and
IIE SCCmec elements was the same as that of the type IV.2
SCCmec element (23). Therefore, we considered these
SCCmec elements to be type II.3, type II elements carrying the
third identiﬁed J1 region (although it was identiﬁed previously
in the type IV.2 SCCmec). With M-PCR 4, the J1 regions of six
SCCmec types, type II, III, or V (type II.1, type II.2, type II.3,
type II.4, type III.1, and type V.1) (Table 1), were identiﬁed
with primer pairs speciﬁc for each type. The sizes of the am-
pliﬁed DNA fragments matched those predicted for the J1
regions of all six SCCmec types (type II.1, 287 bp; type II.2,
1,518 bp; type II.3, 726 bp; type II.4, 2,003 bp; type III.1, 503
bp; type V.1, 1,159 bp) (Fig. 2D and Table 2).
Development of two M-PCRs to identify resistance plas-
mids/transposons integrated into SCCmec elements (J2 and J3
regions). M-PCR 5 was developed to identify transposon
Tn554 or Tn554 integrated into type II and type III SCCmec
elements by targeting ORFs located in the J2 region ﬂanking
these elements and resistance determinants carried by the
transposons (ermA by Tn554 and cadB by Tn554). As ex-
pected, M-PCR 5 ampliﬁed DNA fragments of 2,756 bp (Fig.
2E, lanes 1 and 2), corresponding to CN030-ermA, and 1,540
bp (lane 3), corresponding to CZ021-cadB.
M-PCR 6 was developed to identify differences in the J3
region based on the presence or absence of resistance plasmids
pUB110 and pT181 by amplifying the J3 regions mecA-
ant(4)-1 for pUB110 and mecA-tetK for pT181. As expected,

the DNA fragments ampliﬁed by M-PCR 6 were 4,952 bp (Fig.
2E, lane 4) for mecA-ant(4)-1 and 7,406 bp (Fig. 2E, lane 5)
for mecA-tetK. It should be noted that with M-PCR 6, plasmids
pUB110 and pT181 could be detected if they were located
downstream of mecA but could not be detected if they were
located distant from mecA. In contrast, in the M-PCR devel-
oped previously by Oliveira and Lencastre (20), these plasmids
were identiﬁed with primer sets speciﬁc for each plasmid, re-
gardless of their relative position to mecA, leaving the possi-
bility that these plasmids are located outside the SCCmec el-
ement.
Validation of six multiplex PCRs. We evaluated our system
of six M-PCRs by examining a total of 99 MRSA strains. The
results obtained with the M-PCRs were identical to those ob-
tained by traditional methods, which mostly used a set of two
primers to identify each gene or different allotypes (7, 10, 18).
M-PCR 1 ampliﬁed a single DNA fragment belonging to one
of ﬁve ccr types from the chromosomal DNAs of 83 of the 99
MRSA strains. In 10 strains, two DNA fragments were ampli-
ﬁed, signifying that these strains carry two ccrs, while in 6
strains, no DNA fragments were ampliﬁed (Table 3). Among
the 10 strains that carried two ccrs, 8 carried a type 3 ccr and
ccrC and 2 carried a type 1 ccr and ccrC. Since ccrC is
present in SCC elements carrying the mercury resistance
operon (SCCmercury) or the capsule gene cluster (SCCcap1)
(2, 16), we conducted an M-PCR experiment to identify the
mercury resistance operon and J region in SCCmercury by
using four primers (merA2, merG, mN21, and mN22) listed in
Table 2. DNA fragments indicating the carriage of the mercury
resistance operon were ampliﬁed from the chromosomal
DNAs of all 10 strains, and DNA fragments indicating the
carriage of the J region of SCCmercury were ampliﬁed from
the chromosomal DNAs of 9 of them, signifying that these 9
strains carried SCCmercury. We tentatively regarded the re-
maining strain as a type 1 ccr strain, presuming that ccrC might
be carried by other unknown mobile genetic elements, since no
SCCmec element carrying the combination of ccrC (type 5 ccr)
and class A mec or class B mec has been identiﬁed yet.

With M-PCR 2, the mec gene complexes of 95 of 99 tested
strains were judged to belong to either class A or class B mec,
and those of 4 strains were unclassiﬁable (Table 3).
As such, SCCmec elements carried by 93 of the 99 tested
strains were classiﬁed into one of the six known types of
SCCmec elements (Table 3).
With M-PCRs 3 and 4, these SCCmec elements could be
further classiﬁed based on differences in the J1 region. Overall,
we were able to classify the J1 regions of SCCmec elements
carried by 92 of 93 strains that had an identiﬁed SCCmec type
(Table 3). Interestingly, no DNA fragment from the chromo-
somal DNAs of the six untypeable strains was ampliﬁed by
M-PCR 3 and M-PCR 4, suggesting that these strains might
carry new SCCmec elements.
We used M-PCR 5 to establish the presence or absence of
Tn554 and Tn554 in the J2 regions of type II and type III
SCCmec elements. Tn554 was identiﬁed in 36 of 37 type II
SCCmec elements and 1 of 12 type III SCCmec elements.
Tn554 was identiﬁed in 11 of 12 type III SCCmec elements
(Table 3). One type III SCCmec strain carried Tn554 instead
of Tn554 at the J2 region, as previously reported (9).
We used M-PCR 6 to determine the presence or absence of
plasmids pUB110 and pT181. Plasmid pUB110 was carried by
1 of 17 type I SCCmec elements, 35 of 37 type II SCCmec
elements, 10 of 27 type IV SCCmec elements, and 3 of the 6
untypeable strains. Remarkably, all 10 tested gentamicin-sus-
ceptible MRSA strains (isolated in France in 1996) carried a
type IV.3 SCCmec with an integrated plasmid pUB110. No
type III SCCmec harbored pUB110 downstream of mecA. In
contrast, 8 of 12 type III SCCmec elements harbored plasmid
pT181, which was not identiﬁed in type I, type II, and type IV
SCCmec elements.
Atypical and unclassiﬁable SCCmec elements. We were not
able to identify the ccr gene of six mecA-positive strains with
M-PCR 1. Two of them carried class A mec, the J2 region of
the type II SCCmec element, and the integrated plasmid
pUB110, indicating that the gene lineage pUB110-IS431-
mecA-mecR1-mecI-Tn554, which is usually located in the type
II SCCmec element, was carried by these two strains. Further
studies to determine the nucleotide sequences of the region
between Tn554 and the right-ﬂanking chromosomal region will
clarify whether these strains carry a deleted type II SCCmec or
a novel region with new ccr genes. Three of them carried the
mecR1 gene, whereas the mecI gene was not detected by PCR
testing for the respective genes (18). One strain carried neither
mecR1 nor mecI. The structures of those elements will be the
subject of further investigation.
Comparison to previously reported M-PCRs. Our M-PCRs
do not conﬂict with two previously reported M-PCRs based
primarily on the identiﬁcation of junkyard regions (20, 26).
The M-PCR described previously by Oliveira and Lencastre
(20) has the advantage that it identiﬁes multiple loci simulta-
neously (e.g., the mecA gene, the mecI gene, the J1 region of
type I and type II SCCmec elements, ccrC, the dcs [down-

stream constant sequence] region, pT181, and pUB110). The
M-PCR described previously by Zhang et al. (26) has the
advantage that it identiﬁes the J1 region of eight SCCmec
elements simultaneously. M-PCRs 3 to 6, which were devel-
oped to identify speciﬁc ORFs in J regions, are based on the
same concept as that of the two previously reported M-PCRs.
We ﬁrst used the pls (plasmin-sensitive protein) gene to
identify the J1 region of the type I.1 SCCmec, but that ap-
proach was changed since only 12 of 17 strains were positive
for this gene (6). In addition, the pls gene was identiﬁed with
the chromosomal DNA from a type III SCCmec strain, sug-
gesting that it could not be a speciﬁc marker for the J1 region
of type I SCCmec elements. Oliveira and Lencastre and Zhang
et al. also designed primers speciﬁc to the J1 region of the type
I SCCmec in regions other than the pls gene. The J region of
16 of 17 type I SCCmec strains was classiﬁed as subtype 1 with
both the primers described previously by Oliveira et al. and our
primers.
The identiﬁcation of the J1 region of the type III SCCmec
element was a bit confusing because we ﬁrst reported the
nucleotide sequence of the type III SCCmec element carried
by strain 85/2082 as being the longest one, but this turned out
to be a composite of SCCmercury and a type III SCCmec
element (as indicated in Fig. 1, the length of the type III
SCCmec element is different from that originally reported).
Both Oliveira and Lencastre and Zhang et al. happened to
design primers on the nucleotide sequence of SCCmercury for
the identiﬁcation of type III SCCmec elements. Therefore, the
identiﬁcation of locus E and locus F in the M-PCR described
previously by Oliveira and Lencastre and the identiﬁcation of
the locus used by Zhang et al. indicate the likely presence of
SCCmercury and are not speciﬁc for type III SCCmec ele-
ments.
The identiﬁcation of the J1 regions of type IV SCCmec
elements is similar with our and primers and those described
previously by Zhang et al., except for a primer pair used for the
identiﬁcation of a type IV.3 SCCmec element designed by
Zhang et al. on a locus outside the type IV.3 SCCmec, desig-
nated IE25923.
Prospects for assignment of SCCmec elements. The typing
system designed here is not ﬁnal and should be developed
further, since it could not identify every known difference. For
example, some differences in the J3 regions of the type IV
SCCmec element, such as the carriage of Tn4001 in the type IV
SCCmec of strain 81/108, the different J3 region structures in
type IVE and type IVF SCCmec elements reported previously
by Shore et al. (23), and the presence of dcs in the type III
SCCmec element reported previously by Chongtrakool et al.
(2), were not identiﬁed with our system. Although the structure
of the J1 region is rather speciﬁc to each type and correlates
well with the SCCmec type, we want to emphasize that the
identiﬁcation of the J region did not correlate exactly with the
type of SCCmec element. The type II.3 MRSA strain isolated
in Ireland is a good example: if only the multiplex PCR iden-
tifying the J1 region had been conducted, it would have been
classiﬁed as type IV.2.
It is not easy to conduct six M-PCRs for every case. We
suggest that M-PCRs 1 and 2, for identifying ccr and mec,
should be conducted ﬁrst to assign types of SCCmec elements,
and they might be enough in most of the cases for epidemio-
logical purposes. In cases where further typing is required, we
suggest to proceed with identiﬁcation of the J1 region structure
with M-PCR 3 or 4 or with M-PCRs developed by Zhang et al.,
since the structure of J1 region might reﬂect the structure of an
SCC in which the mec gene complex was integrated. The re-
maining two M-PCRs, M-PCR 5 and M-PCR 6, should be
conducted, if necessary, for additional typing.
Although it might be difﬁcult to determine all SCCmec types
carried by staphylococci, the determination of as many un-
known SCCmec types as possible would be of help for epide-
miological studies as well as for inferring the origins of MRSA
strains. Further discussion is needed in order to form a con-
sensus among staphylococcal researchers regarding how to de-
ﬁne SCCmec element types and how to assign SCCmec ele-
ments to cope with the ever-increasing diversity of SCCmec
elements.
