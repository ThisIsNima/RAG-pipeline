ABSTRACT
Background/Aim Cardiorespiratory ﬁtness (CRF) is a
strong determinant of morbidity and mortality. In
athletes and the general population, it is established that
high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is superior to
moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in
improving CRF. This is a systematic review and meta-
analysis to quantify the efﬁcacy and safety of HIIT
compared to MICT in individuals with chronic
cardiometabolic lifestyle diseases.
Methods The included studies were required to have a
population sample of chronic disease, where poor lifestyle
is considered as a main contributor to the disease. The
procedural quality of the studies was assessed by use of a
modiﬁed Physiotherapy Evidence Base Database (PEDro)
scale. A meta-analysis compared the mean difference (MD)
of preintervention versus postintervention CRF (VO2peak)
between HIIT and MICT.
Results 10 studies with 273 patients were included in
the meta-analysis. Participants had coronary artery disease,
heart failure, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and
obesity. There was a signiﬁcantly higher increase in the
VO2peak after HIIT compared to MICT (MD 3.03 mL/kg/
min, 95% CI 2.00 to 4.07), equivalent to 9.1%.
Conclusions HIIT signiﬁcantly increases CRF by almost
double that of MICT in patients with lifestyle-induced
chronic diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Lifestyle-induced
chronic
diseases
signiﬁcantly
alter the quality of life of sufferers. In many cases,
the disease itself can be potentially avoided or
successfully
managed
with
appropriate
lifestyle
modiﬁcations.1 Diseases such as type II diabetes,
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the meta-
bolic syndrome are closely related and often stem
from the same preventable risk factors. Therapy for
most chronic diseases involves exercise training to
slow or reverse disease progression. Despite the
known beneﬁts of regular moderate-intensity exer-
cise in regulating risk factors in chronic disease, the
majority of patients are still physically inactive.2
Rehabilitation for cardiac patients prior to the
1950s comprised abstention from all forms of
physical activity. This was thought to diminish the
cardiac load and assist in the reparative process of
the healing myocardial scar.3 Levine and Lown4
appear to be the ﬁrst to document challenging the
idea of complete immobilisation by introducing the
then
controversial
‘armchair
treatment’
where
patients were encouraged to sit in an armchair as
much as possible during hospitalisation postmyo-
cardial infarction. When the weight of evidence
suggesting the beneﬁts of light-to-moderate activity
in patients with chronic disease became irrefutable,
exercise guidelines were created for this popula-
tion.5 Interval training appears to have been ﬁrst
studied in cardiac rehabilitation in 1972, when
patients were asked to cycle at high workloads for
60 s with a 30 s rest between intervals. Using the
intervals, the patients were able to exercise for at
least twice as long as what they were able to do
when cycling continuously.6 In 1977, a study on
healthy participants examined the effects of a
10-week programme which included a combination
of
interval
and
moderate
continuous
training.
Interestingly, the authors found a linear increase in
augmenting maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max)
over 10 weeks, contrary to the study’s hypothesis
that VO2 would plateau over time.7 In 1979, it was
suggested that high-intensity exercise was required
to
provoke
the
necessary
training
adaptations
needed to improve exercise capacity in patients
with recent myocardial infarctions.8 One of the
ﬁrst
studies
to
investigate
intense
exercise
in
patients with cardiovascular disease found that if
the exercise is intense and prolonged enough, then
it can instigate a reduction in myocardial ischae-
mia.9 These ﬁndings were revolutionary, as they
were established before widespread percutaneous
coronary
interventions
were
performed.
From
there, differing study protocols in the 1980 s and
1990 s in cardiac patients led to conﬂicting ﬁndings
that appear to have decreased the interest in this
approach.10–12 Forty years after the ﬁrst reported
use of interval training in cardiac patients, the
interest in high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in
higher risk patients has now led to a number of
studies in this area.
HIIT involves alternating short bursts of high-
intensity exercise with recovery periods or light
exercise. Studies in athletes and the general popula-
tion have shown that increasing the intensity of
exercise ampliﬁes the training stimulus and asso-
ciated adaptations, such as VO2max, anaerobic
threshold, stroke volume and performance.13
14
A commonly cited barrier to physical activity is
lack of time. Including HIIT in a training pro-
gramme implies that greater health-enhancing bene-
ﬁts could be gained in less time, making HIIT a
more
time
efﬁcient
and
attractive
option.
Moreover, short bursts of activity may address
another common limiting factor, lack of motiv-
ation, as it may be a more enticing option than the
prospect of continuously exercising for an extended
period of time. Short work periods at a higher
intensity also result in a reduction in the ventilatory

response and resultant dyspnoea, which in many patients with
chronic disease are limiting factors to continuous exercise.15
VO2max is a strong predictor of mortality.16 Indeed, a
1-metabolic equivalent task (MET) increase is associated with a
10–25% improvement in survival.17 Furthermore, it is estab-
lished that cardiorespiratory ﬁtness is more cardioprotective
than the overall physical activity levels.18 This provides further
evidence regarding the beneﬁts of higher intensity exercise com-
pared with lower intensity general physical activity. It seems
likely that improving VO2max will improve the prognosis of
patients with chronic disease.
The aim of this systematic review is to compare and quantify
the effects of HIIT against moderate-intensity continuous train-
ing
(MICT)
in
improving
VO2max
in
patients
with
lifestyle-induced chronic diseases. Furthermore, safety of HIIT
will be discussed along with the feasibility of this approach with
suggestions
to
standardise
terminology
and
protocol
recommendations.
METHODS
Electronic searching of the MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE and
Cinahl databases were conducted from the earliest available date
to April 2013, limited to the English language. The Medical
Subject Heading (MeSH) database was employed to establish all
related articles on HIIT and chronic disease. The MeSH terms
used were ‘cardiovascular diseases’ OR ‘metabolic diseases’ OR
‘chronic diseases’ and their related terms. Text words used in
conjunction with the MeSH terms were ‘high intensity training/
exercise’, OR ‘interval training/exercise’, OR ‘intermittent train-
ing/exercise’, OR ‘low volume training/exercise’ OR ‘aerobic
interval training/exercise’. Reference lists of retrieved articles
were also searched for in other appropriate studies.
Inclusion criteria
Only full text, randomised control trials were considered for
inclusion. The studies were required to have a cardiometabolic
chronic disease population, where poor lifestyle is considered to
be the main contributor. The main characteristics of such dis-
eases, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes,
hypertension, obesity and metabolic syndrome, are recognisable
by the common presence of cardiovascular risk factors. Other
systematic reviews on the effects of HIIT have been conducted
with speciﬁc conditions: pulmonary disease15 and coronary
artery disease.19 Inclusion criteria were: exercise protocols using
cardiorespiratory exercise training; a comparator group that
completed MICT (matched to HIIT); an accepted measure of
intensity (ie, heart rate or rating of perceived exertion); inter-
vention of 4 weeks; appropriate intensities for both groups (eg,
60–75% peak heart rate (PHR) for MICT, 85–95% PHR for
the high-intensity intervals or 80–100% peak work rate (PWR))
and a direct measure of the VO2peak/max. Owing to the difﬁ-
culty patients with chronic disease have in reaching a plateau in
the VO2max, the VO2peak was reported in nine of the
studies.20–28 Studies including other activities (eg, resistance
training) on top of the prescribed aerobic intervention were also
included, provided the same volume and modality of resistance
exercises were given to the MICT and HIIT groups.
Data collection and analysis
After full text analysis of the retrieved articles, 10 articles were
identiﬁed to have met the inclusion criteria for the purpose of
meta-analysis (table S1—web ﬁle only). These trials involved
273 patients consisting of men and women. This included 137
in HIIT groups and 136 in the MICT groups. The correspond-
ing authors of two eligible studies were contacted for VO2 data,
but no information was provided.29 30
The procedural quality of the studies was assessed by use of
the modiﬁed Physiotherapy Evidence Base Database (PEDro)
scale. Table 1 illustrates that one point was awarded for each of
the 10 criteria. Review Manager statistical software V.5.0
(Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to
determine the mean difference and 95% CI. A forest plot is
used to portray the treatment effects of each study (ﬁgure 1).
RESULTS
Seven of the 10 studies included in this review studied cardio-
vascular disease; Rognmo et al21 and Moholdt et al22 investi-
gated coronary artery disease and Wisloff et al,20 Roditis et al,23
Freyssin et al,24 Fu et al28 and Iellamo et al27 recruited heart
failure patients. Molmen-Hansen et al25 studied participants
with hypertension, Schjerve et al26 looked at participants with
obesity and Tjonna et al31 investigated the metabolic syndrome.
Six of the 10 studies were conducted at the same institute, the
Norwegian University of Science and Technology.20–22 25 26 31
The quality assessment of the studies was determined by two
reviewers. Where there was a discrepancy, the average was
taken. The studies achieved a mean PEDro score of 7.35/10.
There was no blinding of all assessors in any of the studies
reviewed. A between-group statistical comparison was provided
by all studies with measures of variability given for the
VO2peak.

Meta-analysis
Nine studies included means and SDs of the VO2peak to allow
the calculation of an overall mean difference.20–27 31 One study
provided means±SE of mean, allowing the SDs to be calcu-
lated.28 Homogeneity between the studies was displayed with
I2=9%, p=0.36. The mean difference in the VO2peak from the
10 studies was 3.03 mL/kg/min (95% CI 2.00 to 4.07), signiﬁ-
cantly (p<0.001) favouring HIIT (ﬁgure 2).
Exercise protocols
Mode
Seven studies used uphill walking/running on a treadmill as the
primary exercise modality.20–22 25–27 31 One study described the
exercise undertaken as ‘treadmill walking’; therefore, the differ-
ences in heart rate between intervals could have been achieved
either through a change in speed or a change in incline.22 In
three studies, cycle ergometers were used for the duration of the
programme.23
24
28
Freyssin
et
al24
used
strengthening,
stretching and relaxing exercises in addition to the treadmill and
cycle programme.
Intensity
Intensities were set based on baseline maximal/peak testing data.
Six studies used a percentage of PHR or maximal heart rate
(MHR), two studies used a percentage of PWR or peak power
and a further two studies used the VO2peak/heart rate reserve
(VO2peak/HRR). The Norwegian studies used a heart rate of
between 85% and 95% for the high-intensity interval with a
recovery of 50–75% MHR.20–22 25 26 31 Two studies on the cycle
ergometer were set at an intensity of 80% and 120% PWR for
the high-intensity interval with a passive recovery.23 24 The two
studies using the HRR/VO2peak to determine intensity used 75–
80% for the interval and 40–50% for an active recovery.27 28
Total duration
A common approach to compare the HIIT and MICT sessions is
to match the energy expenditure, resulting in the HIIT session

being shorter. Seven of the studies differed the duration of the
HIIT and MICT sessions so that the training sessions were isoca-
loric.20–22 25 26 28 31 The median duration of exercise times was
38 min for the HIIT group and 46 min for the MICT group.
One study kept the duration identical between both groups but
altered the mean intensity between the groups.23 Another study
used a different method (training impulse method) to alter the
duration of each session based on the average change in heart
rate.27
Interval duration
Seven of the studies included high-intensity intervals of 4 min
with 3 min of active recovery.20–22 25–27 31 One study included
5×3 min intervals with 3 min recoveries.28 Two studies included
shorter interval and recovery periods, with 30 s used for interval
as well as recovery,23 and 30 s used for interval and 60 s for
recovery.24
Supervision
Three studies included a supervised training component as well
as a self-administered home programme,20 22 26 whereas the
remaining were purely supervised sessions. Direct supervision
allows the instructor to adjust the intensity, monitor the patient
and provide motivation. The length of supervised HIIT or
MICT within the studies varied from 4 to 16 weeks. One study
was supervised for the ﬁrst 4 weeks, and thereafter the partici-
pants were advised to continue the training programme at home
for the following 6 months.22 The studies prescribed 3–6 train-
ing sessions/week, with two studies including one home session/
week out of the three for the HIIT and MICT groups.20 26
Owing to the constant changes in the heart rate response to
exercise, supervision allows for a closer monitoring to ensure
that the rates are within the desired zones. Therefore, the pres-
ence of a supervisor is quite likely to improve the accuracy of
the intensity.
Outcomes
Adaptations occurring signiﬁcantly more with HIIT compared
with MICT are shown in box 1.
Cardiorespiratory ﬁtness
There were improvements in the VO2peak from HIIT as well as
MICT in nine of the ten studies.20–22 24–28 31 The average of
the pretraining values was 22.5 and increased to 27.9 mL/kg/
min after HIIT (a 19.4% increase). MICT had baseline values of
22.6 that increased to 25.2 mL/kg/min after the intervention
(10.3% increase). The mean difference in the change in the
VO2peak
between
HIIT and
MICT was
3.03 mL/kg/min.
A measure of exercise capacity (6 min walk test), as well as the
VO2peak, was assessed in one study. It was found that the dis-
tance walked improved in the HIIT and MICT groups.24
Cardiometabolic risk factors
The study by Tjonna et al31 found that MICT and HIIT both
reduced blood pressure, approximately 10 mm Hg systolic and
6 mm Hg diastolic. Molmen-Hansen et al25 also showed a sig-
niﬁcant reduction of 12 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure in
the HIIT group. Other studies showed no change in systolic
blood pressure after the interventions. Signiﬁcant reductions in
oxidised low-density lipoproteins were found in HIIT but not
MICT.20 31 However, in one study, the opposite was found.26
Furthermore, it was established that high-density lipoprotein
was increased by 25% in the HIIT group.31 These changes were
supported by Wisloff et al20 who also found an increase in high-
density lipoprotein, lower triglycerides and improved fasting
glucose in the HIIT group. An improvement in triglycerides was
identiﬁed by Moholdt et al22 for the HIIT and MICT groups.
Iellamo et al27 found no signiﬁcant differences in the metabolic
proﬁle (lipids, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR)), with the exception of an improvement in fasting
glucose with HIIT. Fu et al28 found improvements in oxidative
stress/inﬂammatory markers plasma brain natriuretic peptides,
myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6.
Two
studies
demonstrated
no
positive
improvements
in
weight loss, body mass index or body composition between the
HIIT and MICT groups postintervention.27 31 Furthermore, one
study on obese patients reported a greater decrease in body
weight with MICT than with HIIT.26 However, reduced fatty
acid transport protein 1 (FATP-1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS)
levels (markers of fatty acid uptake and lipogenesis) were identi-
ﬁed, which was associated with improvements in anti-insulin
receptor activation in HIIT but not MICT.31
The ﬁndings from Tjonna et al31 showed increased circulating
adiponectin and improved insulin sensitivity and β-cell function
in the HIIT group. No changes in adiponectin were found by
Moholdt et al22 at 4 weeks; however, after the 6-month inter-
vention, HIIT and MICT increased the circulating levels.
Skeletal muscle
Three
studies
identiﬁed
signiﬁcant
increases
in
PGC-1α,
indicating improved mitochondrial biogenesis in the HIIT
group.20
26
31 These studies also signiﬁcantly increased the
maximal rate of Ca2+ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
by 50–73%. Changes in the total myoglobin concentration and
tissue oxygenation in the vastus lateralis were observed in HIIT
but not MICT both acutely and after the 12 week intervention.28
Myocardium and vasculature
Flow-mediated dilation was improved after HIIT and MICT in
studies that
assessed
endothelial
function.20

An
increased availability of nitric oxide was found with HIIT but
not MICT.31 Furthermore, a greater increase in antioxidant
status, found in HIIT rather than MICT, supports the ﬁnding of

increased production and availability of nitric oxide.20 An
improvement in antioxidant status was not supported by the
ﬁndings of Schjerve et al.26 Patients with heart failure demon-
strated improved left ventricular ejection fraction by 10% and a
positive reversal of left ventricular remodelling.20 An improve-
ment in left ventricular ejection fraction was also demonstrated
by Fu et al,28 alongside increases in cardiac output and total
peripheral resistance. In contrast, Iellamo et al27 found no dif-
ference in cardiac output, stroke volume and left ventricular
ejection fraction in their patients with heart failure. Patients
with hypertension also had signiﬁcantly improved ejection frac-
tion, stroke volume, systolic ﬂow velocity, end-diastolic volume,
early diastolic mitral annulus tissue velocity and isovolumic
relaxation rate.25
Adherence
A minimum attendance of 70% and 90% of training sessions
was an inclusion criterion for four of the studies.21 22 25 26
Only one participant was excluded from the analysis from one
of these studies based on this criterion.21 For the ﬁrst 4-week
supervised period of Moholdt et al’s study, the HIIT group
attended 82% of sessions and the MICT group attended 84%.
The attendance rate during the remainder of the 6-month home
programme was not identiﬁed.22 Both groups in six of the other
studies reported attendance rates above 85%.20 21 24 27 28 31
One study did not mention adherence to the protocol for either
group.23
Enjoyment and quality of life
HIIT was reported to be more enjoyable than MICT.31 Three
studies demonstrated that HIIT improved the quality of life
more than MICT,20 25 28 whereas another study showed similar
increases between the two groups.22 Anxiety and depression
also had similar improvements with HIITand MICT.24
Adverse events
Reporting of adverse events is important in determining the safety
of applying this type of training to high-risk populations. No
studies
described
their
adverse
event
monitoring
protocol.
However, four reported no adverse events due to the exercise train-
ing20–22 24 and six did not mention adverse events.23 25–28 31
DISCUSSION
The main ﬁnding from this meta-analysis is that HIIT is superior
to MICT in improving CRF in patients with lifestyle-induced
chronic diseases. Indeed, the increase in the VO2peak with HIIT
was almost twice the increase gained from MICT. In addition,
although there are limited data, HIIT appears to be well toler-
ated and safe.
Efﬁcacy
HIIT increased the VO2peak by 5.4(19.4%) compared with
2.6 mL/kg/min (10.3%) with MICT. It has been shown that a
1-MET (3.5 mL/kg/min) increase is associated with 10–25%
improvement in survival.17 Indeed, the protective role of ﬁtness
occurs even in the presence of established cardiovascular disease
risk factors.32 CRF is an easily modiﬁable risk factor; therefore,
identifying the most effective way to improve VO2peak should
be a health priority.
Some of the studies investigated mechanisms explaining the
greater improvement of the VO2peak with HIIT. Peripheral
adaptations leading to improvements in CRF were investigated
by measuring PGC-1α and Ca2+ reuptake into sarcoplasmic
reticulum in the skeletal muscles. Mitochondrial dysfunction is
central to most chronic diseases and could play a vital role in
the reduced CRF that is experienced by these populations.
Improvements in mitochondrial biogenesis have been demon-
strated by increases in PGC-1α after a single bout of low
volume HIIT.33 Studies by Tjonna et al31 and Wisloff et al20
identiﬁed signiﬁcant increases in PGC-1α (138% and 47%,
respectively), indicating mitochondrial biogenesis in the HIIT
group. Wisloff et al20 found the increase in PGC-1α to be
strongly
correlated
with
the
improved
VO2peak
(r=0.72,
p<0.01), supporting the inﬂuence of mitochondrial function on
exercise capacity. Mitochondrial biogenesis is essential to main-
tain the structural integrity of skeletal muscle. Daussin et al34
concluded that a ﬂuctuation in ATP turnover in interval training,
which is different from the usual steady-state conditions of ATP
production, activates the signalling pathways, which lead to
increases in PGC-1α. The increase in PGC-1α identiﬁed by
Wisloff et al and Tjonna et al may translate into improvements
in aerobic and functional capacity. Both studies also signiﬁcantly
increased the maximal rate of Ca2+ reuptake into the sarcoplas-
mic reticulum by 50–60%.20 31 The increase in calcium cycling
reduces
skeletal
muscle
fatigue
and
would
contribute
to
improvements in muscle function and therefore CRF. The ﬁnd-
ings by Fu et al28 demonstrate repeated bouts of deoxygenation
in HIIT but not MICT, which may contribute to the observed
adaptations to the muscles’ oxidative capacity.
Improvement
in
the
VO2peak
with
HIIT can
also
be
explained mechanistically by central factors. Findings from one
of the studies indicate that HIIT improved ejection fraction in
patients with heart failure to the same degree as treating with
ACE inhibitors and β-blockers, outlining the potential for
further left ventricular remodelling with HIIT (Wisloff20).
Improvements in cardiac remodelling are supported by the ﬁnd-
ings of Fu et al,28 with signiﬁcant reductions in brain plasma
natriuretic peptide levels. HIIT may also contest modern
medical treatments in improving systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, with signiﬁcant decreases of 12 and 8 mm Hg, respect-
ively, found in patients with hypertension.25 It was also found
that the myocardial contractile function was improved with
HIIT in terms of stroke volume, mitral annular excursion, ejec-
tion velocity and systolic mitral annular velocity. Besides a small
reduction in the left ventricular ﬁlling pressure with MICT, the
aforementioned improvements in systolic and diastolic function
with HIITwere not found with MICT.
Conversely, Roditis et al23 demonstrated similar improve-
ments in the VO2peak for the HIIT and MICT groups.
Furthermore, the ﬁndings suggest that phase II of oxygen
kinetics (indirect measurement of muscle oxidative capacity),
showed superior improvements after MICT. The use of 30 s
Wingate sprint intervals in this study may highlight the need for
a longer duration of intervals, such as those used in four of the
other studies reviewed.20–22 31 Although 30 s intervals are a
more time efﬁcient option than endurance training (similar
improvements shown with ∼90% less volume), 30 s may not be
long enough to induce superior health-enhancing beneﬁts.14 It
appears from the studies reviewed that HIITelicits many superior
beneﬁts to MICT in a slightly shorter time period (median 38 vs
46 min, respectively). It seems reasonable to suggest that gaining
similar beneﬁts would require either a longer period of MICT or
an even shorter period of HIIT, supporting the ideology of HIIT
being a more time efﬁcient option. Future studies should identify
the minimum amount of HIIT needed to elicit adaptations similar
to MICT. There was another study that did not ﬁnd a greater
beneﬁt of HIIT over MICT, which may be due to the method of
establishing intensity by assessing blood lactate levels.27

The HERITAGE study has established the inﬂuence genetic
components have on the trainability of the VO2max in certain
individuals, resulting in ‘non-responders’ to exercise training.35
The consistently large improvements in the VO2max seen in a
variety of cohorts in the HIIT studies questions whether this
type of training can ameliorate the familial dampening of VO2
in these ‘non-responders’. Only one study in 1986 has examined
the relationship between HIIT and hereditary trainability.36
Although aerobic capacity was not assessed in this study, it was
found that genotype was associated with anaerobic capacity
after a HIIT training intervention, suggesting that the effective-
ness of HIIT is affected by hereditary factors.36 Indeed, in the
studies reviewed in the meta-analysis, the SD of the change in
the VO2peak in the HIIT group was 26% (relative to the mean
change), whereas the MICT group had only an 8% variance.
Future studies are needed to further compare the effects of
HIIT and MICT on the VO2peak trainability.
In addition to CRF, efﬁcacy can also be assessed by the effect
on cardiometabolic risk factors. The studies reviewed found
reductions in risk factors in HIIT notwithstanding the differ-
ences in body mass, body mass index or weight loss between
HIIT and MICT. These ﬁndings are supportive of the theory of
‘ﬁtness over fatness’—in that it is more beneﬁcial to health to
improve physical ﬁtness than to focus solely on weight loss. This
is supported by Terada et al37 who found similar reductions in
body fat percentage in the HIIT and MICT groups after a 5 day/
week, 12 week programme. Although weight loss was not differ-
ent between groups, one study found a reduction in the FATP-1
and FAS levels in the HIIT group, suggesting a suppression of
fatty acid uptake and lipogenesis. No studies measured visceral
adiposity; however, the existence of increased circulating adipo-
nectin levels found with HIIT but not MICT is suggestive of
decreased intra-abdominal obesity.
Owing to the augmented PHR and cardiac output that is
experienced in HIIT, it is quite likely that pulsatile and shear
stress inﬂuence vasculature during periods of intense exercise.38
Interval exercise has been shown to reduce arterial stiffness
through increased distensibility of the vessels.38
39 A recent
study by Smart and Steele40 demonstrated no difference in
ﬁtness and cardiac function between moderate training and
intermittent training groups matched by the volume of work.
However, the intervals were not high intensity, suggesting that
to elicit changes, intervals need to increase the heart rate to a
certain level. Arterial stiffness is a key contributor to a number
of cardiovascular conditions that inﬂuence mortality through
cardiovascular disease.41 Two studies demonstrated higher endo-
thelial derived nitric oxide production in the HIIT group.20 31
It is suggested that shear stress through an increase in pulse and
frequency pressure promotes vasodilatory nitric oxide release,
thereby increasing arterial compliance.42 This is further sup-
ported by Wisloff et al20 and Tjonna et al31 who found greater
increases in ﬂow-mediated dilation in HIIT than in MICT. The
improvements in endothelial function are supported by the ﬁnd-
ings from Fu et al.28 The study’s ﬁndings demonstrate an
increase in perfusion and oxygen utilisation between cerebral
and muscular tissues, which occurs through increases in shear
ﬂow and metabolic stress. The increased perfusion to the vastus
lateralis and frontal cortex would promote increased ﬂow and
shear stress and therefore the release of NO.
Safety
The reporting of adverse events enables the safety of the inter-
vention to be inferred to the population being studied. Four of
the 10 reviewed studies reported no adverse events as a result of
the exercise training.20–22 24 One study that did not mention
adverse events did explain that follow-up testing was not per-
formed on ﬁve patients either due to orthopaedic-related pro-
blems
or
the
inconvenient
programme
timetable.23
Other
reasons cited for loss of patient follow-up were comorbidities
(the group was not cited),22 ankle fracture in the HIIT group
and knee injury in the MICT group.21 One participant in the
MICT group died from cardiac causes; however, it was stated
that this was unrelated to exercise training.20
A recent study by Rognmo et al 43 aimed to assess the safety
of HIIT compared to MICT, during and after exercise, in
patients with coronary heart disease in cardiac rehabilitation.
The study of 4846 participants indicated that the risk of a car-
diovascular event occurring is low in MICT and HIIT. During
this study, there was one fatal cardiac event during MICT and
two non-fatal cardiac events during HIIT. The calculated event
rates were 1/129 456 h of moderate-intensity exercise and
1/23 182 h of high-intensity exercise. Moreover, when vigorous
intensity exercise was energy matched with moderate-intensity
exercise, greater cardioprotective beneﬁts were elicited. To
accurately assess a cardiac event occurring during training, the
study required a sample size of >20 500 patients. Despite the
study being underpowered,44 the results explore the beneﬁcial
dose–response relationship associated with HIIT and the negli-
gible risk that is involved.
The safety of HIIT has been controversial among health pro-
fessionals treating high-risk populations. This has perhaps been
created through a common avoidance of anginal episodes,
which can sometimes be triggered by high-intensity exercise.
Although commonly thought to be a dangerous byproduct of
exercise, episodes of controlled ischaemia may actually be bene-
ﬁcial in preventing secondary conditions in coronary artery
disease through ischaemic preconditioning.45 Exercise-induced
coronary collateral formation is based on the vascular endothe-
lial growth factor, and this adaptation is correlated with exercise
intensity. Lu et al46 found that exercise-induced intermittent
ischaemia promoted coronary angiogenesis by the vascular
endothelial growth factor. The favourable effects of intermittent
exercise on angiogenesis is further supported in a meta-analysis
on peripheral arterial disease.47 In a study by Lu et al, a normal
cardiac
troponin
I
indicated
that
no
myocardial
damage
occurred when ischaemia was applied. Lu et al state that HIIT is
safe even for patients with high-risk chronic disease with stable

angina. Rather than promoting the instigation of angina in
HIIT, this information is intended to highlight the safety of
HIIT in high-risk populations. Caution should be exercised on a
case-by-case basis depending on the participant’s cardiac history.
Indeed, despite the patients in the studies reviewed being a high-
risk cohort, they were only included if their diseases were rela-
tively well controlled or stable. Therefore, these ﬁndings may
not be applicable to some patients in these disease groups.
Box 2 provides a suggested guide of contraindications for par-
ticipation in HIIT in high-risk patients. In summary, when used
with
appropriate
screening
and
communication
with
the
patient’s doctor, HIIT can be a safe option for patients with
high risk.
Limitations
Although this review provides the basis for further clinical trials
testing of HIIT in rehabilitation of patients with chronic disease,
all the studies analysed experienced methodological limitations.
Although three of the studies used a different training protocol
to the other seven, the heterogeneity of the VO2peak measure
was low (χ2=9.90, I2=9%, p=0.36).23 24 28 Owing to the rela-
tively recent interest with HIIT in chronic disease, HIIT training
guidelines have not yet been created. Consequently, current
research consists of a variety of intervals, intensities and pro-
gramme durations. Furthermore, comparison of studies proves
difﬁcult when volumes of HIIT and MICT are equated in differ-
ent ways. There are also discrepancies in the percentage of heart
rate used. Some of the studies used a higher deﬁnition of mod-
erate intensity (75%) to the general intensity of moderate exer-
cise suggested by Norton et al (55–70% MHR) and the
American
College
of
Sports
medicine
(ACSM;
60–70%
MHR).2 20 21 48 Not all studies included assessor blinding of
the VO2peak, which may have inﬂuenced the testing results.
Also, studies in cardiac rehabilitation programmes may have
been guided by other confounding factors such as dietary advice
or smoking status. A limitation of this review is that 6 of the 10
studies reviewed are from the same research group. It is import-
ant that these ﬁndings are replicated in future studies at other
institutions.
The studies reviewed consisted of small sample sizes, with
one study including an unequal male-to-female ratio.20 The
current literature is lacking in HIIT studies on all the chronic
diseases.
This
systematic
review
on
the
cardiometabolic
lifestyle-induced chronic diseases would have beneﬁted from
studies with other lifestyle diseases such as type II diabetes and
chronic kidney disease. Owing to the limited research in this
area, a variety of diverse diseases were included under the title
cardiometabolic disease for this meta-analysis. However, the
pathophysiology of the varied diseases may mean that HIIT will
have different inﬂuences on the parameters being compared
among different studies. Research on more chronic diseases will
allow speciﬁc prescription guidelines to be recommended.
Protocol recommendations
Future research is needed to establish the optimal protocol of
HIIT. However, based on the ﬁndings from this review, recom-
mendations in table 2 are provided. It is important to note that
the effectiveness and adherence to different HIIT protocols will
always be highly individualised.
Mode and intensity
The duration of intervals can differ greatly in various HIIT pro-
tocols. Two studies which used shorter duration intervals of 30 s
showed no improvements and smaller improvements in the
VO2peak, respectively.23
24 Studies which demonstrated the
biggest changes in the VO2peak after a HIIT intervention used
the 4×4 approach (4 intervals at 4 min each between 90% and
95% PHR).20–22
25
26
31 The recommendation of the 4×4
approach (∼40 min duration) in table 2 does not preclude
shorter duration HIIT protocols being potentially more appro-
priate. However, more research is needed to compare a shorter
duration
of
HIIT
with
the
current
recommendation.
Furthermore, future research comparing HIIT and MICT should
ensure that MICT is kept consistent with current deﬁnitions of
moderate exercise.
Recovery
The intensity and duration of the recovery period in HIIT may
play just as integral role as the interval period. Past research has
suggested that an active recovery is recommended in order to
effectively aid the process of lactate removal.49 However, a
study by Dupont et al50 indicated that during the active rest
period there was less replenishment of oxygen in myoglobin
and haemoglobin and a reduced rate of resynthesis of phospho-
creatine from the previous work phase. Meyer et al’s study51 on
patients with chronic heart failure found that short intervals
(30 s) with passive recovery provided the most beneﬁt (longest
time to exhaustion in an exercise test). This study also deter-
mined that including a passive recovery instigated a lower rating
of perceived exertion as indicated on the BORG scale, despite
having a higher oxygen pulse, which is dependent on the stroke
volume and arteriovenous difference.51 Logistically, it may be
more practical and convenient to include an active recovery for
the purpose of timing and equipment control, albeit at as low
an intensity as possible. To successfully employ HIIT, recovery
intensities need to be achieved. If the heart rate is not reducing
to the required intensity by the end of the recovery period, the
interval work rate should be adjusted accordingly.
Feasibility
Indisputably, the success of an exercise intervention and maxi-
mising long-term beneﬁts relies directly on adherence to the
exercise programme. Central to adherence is the enjoyment of
the activity being prescribed. Bartlett et al52 found that the
ratings of perceived enjoyment after HIIT were higher when
compared to MICT. It was identiﬁed in this study that the
rating of perceived exertion had a positive correlation with
enjoyment, through a likely combination of stimulation and
accomplishment.
Wisloff et al’s20 study addresses the feasibility of HIIT being
performed independently. During home sessions, participants
were provided with heart rate monitors that recorded heart rate
data. These monitors were placed so that they could not be seen

by the participant. The patients achieved the correct heart rate
zones without feedback from the heart rate monitor. The design
of this study supports the feasibility of incorporating HIIT into
a real-world situation, where a home HIIT programme can be
successfully prescribed after a familiarisation period. This is
further supported by Moholdt et al,53 who demonstrated that
adherence to a home programme of HIIT was as suitable as the
usual cardiac residential care.
Future directions
Given the small number of studies conducted thus far, there are
still important questions that need to be addressed. Similar to
current issues with the dose response of less intensive exercise,
much more work is needed to determine if the recommenda-
tions provided here provide the optimal approach for future
studies. Furthermore, it is realistic that most people will
combine HIIT with MICT; therefore, determining the optimal
ratio of both types of training over longer periods of time is
also important. Similarly, current guidelines for all populations
recommend the inclusion of resistance training in an exercise
programme; yet the interaction between HIIT and resistance
training is unknown. As it is likely that most people will include
HIIT and resistance training in the same session, future studies
should identify the ratio of HIIT and resistance training needed
for optimal beneﬁts.
Analogous to the clinical trial phases in the development of a
new pharmaceutical product, the evaluation of HIIT training
for patients with cardiometabolic diseases would be in phase 2
(assessing efﬁcacy). Indeed, the guidelines for clinical popula-
tions should use the same approach and criteria as other therap-
ies (eg, drugs), with eventual recommendations based on large
randomised control trials and not on small feasibility and efﬁ-
cacy studies alone.
Another important question is regarding adherence after the
supervised
programme.
Future
studies
should
determine
whether this approach is sustainable in a non-supervised, home-
based environment.
Consistency of terminology
The terminology used to describe HIIT varies across research
groups. The Norwegian research group that has conducted the
majority of studies in this area has preferred the term ‘aerobic
interval training (AIT)’. Other prominent groups have used
‘SIT’ to describe all-out supramaximal (>100% VO2max) inter-
vals in studies with healthy individuals14 54 or low-volume HIIT
when short intervals (∼30 s) with an intensity <95% are
used.55 56 We suggest that the classiﬁcation scheme shown in
ﬁgure 3 is used to standardise terminology in future studies.
This approach is based on (1) the widespread media use of the
term ‘HIIT’ rather than ‘AIT’ for nearmaximal intensity (80–
100% PHR) intervals, (2) the additional information regarding
the intensity of the interval provided by HIIT compared to AIT
and (3) the need to separate all-out supramaximal sprint interval
training from HIIT as there are concerns for the safety of this
all-out approach in clinical populations. Furthermore, it is sug-
gested that, in comparative studies, the term ‘moderate-intensity
continuous training’ (MICT) should be used, where appropriate.
CONCLUSIONS
This meta-analysis has identiﬁed that HIIT has more physio-
logical beneﬁts than MICT in patients with lifestyle-induced car-
diometabolic disease. HIIT signiﬁcantly improved CRF by
almost double that of MICT (19.4% vs 10.3%). This should
translate into greater decreases in risks of morbidity and all-
cause mortality. Incorporation of HIIT into a rehabilitation pro-
gramme may be a more achievable way for people with chronic
disease to reach a level of exercise that promotes health enhancing
beneﬁts. These ﬁndings suggest that future exercise guidelines for
lifestyle-induced cardiometabolic disease should incorporate HIIT.
There are various logistical considerations that contribute to the
feasibility of a HIIT programme; however, if participants are
adequately screened and the programme is prescribed and super-
vised by appropriately trained and qualiﬁed individuals, then it
should be an achievable training option.
What are the new ﬁndings?
▸High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is superior to
moderate-intensity continuous training in improving
cardiorespiratory ﬁtness in lifestyle-induced cardiometabolic
diseases.
▸HIIT is well-tolerated, safe and improves the quality of life.
▸Central and peripheral adaptations are responsible for the
superior beneﬁts of HIIT.
