ABSTRACT
Protecting the health of the athlete is a goal of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC
convened an expert panel to update the 2005 IOC
Consensus Statement on the Female Athlete Triad. This
Consensus Statement replaces the previous and provides
guidelines to guide risk assessment, treatment and
return-to-play decisions. The IOC expert working group
introduces a broader, more comprehensive term for the
condition previously known as ‘Female Athlete Triad’.
The term ‘Relative Energy Deﬁciency in Sport’ (RED-S),
points to the complexity involved and the fact that male
athletes are also affected. The syndrome of RED-S refers
to impaired physiological function including, but not
limited to, metabolic rate, menstrual function, bone
health, immunity, protein synthesis, cardiovascular health
caused by relative energy deﬁciency. The cause of this
syndrome is energy deﬁciency relative to the balance
between dietary energy intake and energy expenditure
required for health and activities of daily living, growth
and sporting activities. Psychological consequences can
either precede RED-S or be the result of RED-S. The
clinical phenomenon is not a ‘triad’ of the three entities
of energy availability, menstrual function and bone
health, but rather a syndrome that affects many aspects
of physiological function, health and athletic
performance. This Consensus Statement also
recommends practical clinical models for the
management of affected athletes. The ‘Sport Risk
Assessment and Return to Play Model’ categorises the
syndrome into three groups and translates these
classiﬁcations into clinical recommendations.
INTRODUCTION
Protecting the health of the athlete is one of the
goals of the International Olympic Committee
(IOC).1 The Olympic Movement Medical Code,
which governs the actions of the IOC Medical
Commission and sport organisations, also empha-
sises the importance of protecting the health of the
athlete.2 In 2005, the IOC published the Consensus
Statement (Consensus Statement) and the IOC
Position Stand (Position Stand)3 on the Female
Athlete Triad.4 Based on scientiﬁc evidence pub-
lished in the intervening period, this Consensus
Statement serves to update and replace these docu-
ments and provide guidelines to the athlete health
support team to guide risk assessment, treatment
and return-to-play decisions for affected athletes.
Relative energy deﬁciency in sport
In
the
2005
IOC
Consensus
Statement,4
the
Female Athlete Triad (Triad) was deﬁned as ‘the
combination of disordered eating (DE) and irregu-
lar menstrual cycles eventually leading to a decrease
in endogenous oestrogen and other hormones,
resulting in low bone mineral density’(BMD) based
on the original scientiﬁc evidence of Drinkwater
et al.5 In 2007, following progress in scientiﬁc
understanding, the American College of Sports
Medicine redeﬁned the Triad as a clinical entity
that refers to the ‘relationship between three inter-
related components: energy availability (EA), men-
strual function and bone health’. Added was an
understanding of the pathophysiology describing
the concept that over a period of time, the athlete
moves along on a continuous spectrum ranging
from the healthy athlete with optimal EA, regular
menses and healthy bones to the opposite end of
the spectrum characterised by amenorrhoea, low
EA and osteoporosis.6
Since 2007, scientiﬁc evidence and clinical experi-
ence show that the aetiological factor underpinning
the Triad is an energy deﬁciency relative to the
balance between dietary energy intake (EI) and the
energy expenditure required to support homoeosta-
sis, health and the activities of daily living, growth
and sporting activities. It is also evident that the clin-
ical phenomenon is not a triad of three entities of
EA, menstrual function and bone health, but rather
a syndrome resulting from relative energy deﬁciency
that affects many aspects of physiological function
including metabolic rate, menstrual function, bone
health, immunity, protein synthesis, cardiovascular
and psychological health. In addition, it is evident
that relative energy deﬁciency also affects men.
Therefore, a new terminology is required to more
accurately describe the clinical syndrome originally
known as the Female Athlete Triad. Based on its
interdisciplinary
expertise,
the
IOC
Consensus
group introduces a more comprehensive, broader
term for the overall syndrome, which includes what
has so far been called the ‘Female Athlete Triad’:
Relative Energy Deﬁciency in Sport (RED-S).
The syndrome of RED-S refers to impaired
physiological function including, but not limited to,
metabolic rate, menstrual function, bone health,
immunity, protein synthesis, cardiovascular health
caused by relative energy deﬁciency.

The underlying problem of RED-S is an inadequacy of energy
to support the range of body functions involved in optimal
health and performance. EA is calculated as EI minus the energy
cost of exercise relative to fat-free mass (FFM) and in healthy
adults, a value of 45 kcal/kg FFM/day equates energy balance.7
Low EA, which occurs with a reduction in EI and/or increased
exercise load, causes adjustments to body systems to reduce
energy expenditure, leading to disruption of an array of hormo-
nal, metabolic and functional characteristics.7 DE underpins a
large proportion of cases of low EA, but other situations, such
as a mismanaged programme to quickly reduce body mass/fat or
an inability to track EI with an extreme exercise commitment,
may occur without such a psychological overlay.7
Although the literature on low EA has focused on female
athletes, it has also been reported to occur in male athletes.8
Prevalence studies of low EA in male athletes have been few,
however, low EA appears to occur among the same at risk
sports as for female athletes: the weight sensitive sports in
which leanness and/or weight are important due to their role in
performance, appearance or requirement to meet a competition
weight category.8
Although simple messages about optimal, tolerable and unsafe
levels of EA have been provided9 there are some caveats in the
science. First, the complex dose–response relationship between
reduction in EA and the disruption of various hormones10 and
bone formation markers11 vary in nature and thresholds.
Therefore, the cost of any energy mismatch should be carefully
considered before it is implemented. A second caveat is that it is
now known that the resting metabolic rate in athletes of small
body size is underestimated in the linear scaling of EA relative
to LBM/FFM.12 Finally, ﬁndings from laboratory settings may
not apply as cleanly to free-living athletes. Numerous studies in
female athletes have failed to ﬁnd clear thresholds or associa-
tions between ﬁeld determinations of low EA and objective mea-
sures of energy conservation such as metabolic hormones13 and
menstrual disturbances.14 It is possible that other factors seen in
free-living populations such as psychological stress, greater vari-
ability in between-day and within-day energy deﬁciency or
dietary characteristics interact with each other to alter the
effects of low EA.
Disordered eating
The disordered eating (DE) continuum starts with appropriate
eating and exercise behaviours, including healthy dieting and
the occasional use of more extreme weight loss methods such as
short-term restrictive diets (<30 kcal/kg FFM/day).15 The con-
tinuum ends with clinical eating disorders (EDs), abnormal
eating behaviours, distorted body image, weight ﬂuctuations,
medical complications and variable athletic performance. The
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
diagnostic classiﬁcations for EDs include anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa, binge ED and other speciﬁed and unspeciﬁed
feeding or ED.16 These EDs have many features in common,
and athletes frequently move among them.8 The pathogenesis of
EDs is multifactorial with cultural, familial, individual and
genetic/biochemical factors playing roles.17 In addition, factors
speciﬁc to sport such as dieting to enhance performance, per-
sonality factors,
pressure to
lose weight, frequent weight
cycling, early start of sport-speciﬁc training, overtraining, recur-
rent and non-healing injuries, inappropriate coaching behaviour
and regulations in some sports have been suggested.8 The preva-
lence of DE is about 20% and 13% among adult and adolescent
female elite athletes, and 8% and 3% in adult and adolescent
male elite athletes, respectively.15 18 The prevalence differs sig-
niﬁcantly among sports.15
Hormonal and metabolic imbalance
Eumenorrhea is deﬁned as regular cycles occurring at intervals
between 21 and 35 days. In adolescents, the cycles range between
21 and 45 days.19 Primary amenorrhoea is deﬁned as no menarche
by age 15 years.20 Secondary amenorrhoea refers to an absence of
three
consecutive
cycles
post-menarche.
Oligomenorrhea
is
deﬁned as a cycle length greater than 45 days. Estimates of the
prevalence of menstrual disorders in athletes vary widely.21
Secondary amenorrhoea prevalence is estimated in collegiate
women from 2% to 5% and as high as 69% in dancers22 and 65%
in long-distance runners.23 Primary amenorrhoea in collegiate ath-
letes was found to be 7% overall, and was higher (22%) in cheer-
leading, diving and gymnastics.24 Subtle menstrual dysfunction,
such as very light bleeding, mildly extended menstrual interval and
premenstrual and postmenstrual spotting may occur, and may be
underestimated by routine screening.25
Abnormal levels of hormones,26 LH pulsatility, inadequate
body fat stores, low EA and exercise stress may be aetiological
factors in menstrual disorders in athletes. Marked reduction in
EA may disrupt the LH pulsatility by affecting the hypothalamic
hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone output27 which sub-
sequently
alters
the
menstrual
cycle.
This
is
known
as
Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA). Rapid or signiﬁ-
cant fat mass reduction, even over as short as a 1-month period,
may compromise menstrual function. Low EA alters levels of
metabolic hormones and substrates, for example, insulin, corti-
sol,
growth
hormone,
insulin-like
growth
factor-I
(IGF-I),
3,3,5-triiodothyronine,
grehlin,
leptin,
peptide
tyrosine–
tyrosine, glucose, fatty acids and ketones.28
Health and performance consequences of RED-S
RED-S can have serious implications for many body systems,
resulting in short-term and long-term compromise of optimal
health and performance. Athletes who suffer from long-term
low EA may develop nutrient deﬁciencies (including anaemia),
chronic fatigue and increased risk of infections and illnesses, all
of which have the potential to harm health and performance.6
Physiological and medical complications involve the cardiovas-
cular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, reproductive, skeletal, renal
and central nervous systems.6 Psychological stress and/or depres-
sion can result in low EA and EDs and can also be a result of
low EA.17 Research indicates that muscle protein synthesis is
reduced even at EA of 30 kcal/kg FFM/day.29 Low EA causes
unfavourable lipid proﬁles and endothelial dysfunction, thereby
increasing
cardiovascular
risk.30
Hormonal
and
metabolic
abnormalities caused by RED-S and carbohydrate deﬁciency can
result in a reduction in glucose utilisation, mobilisation of fat
stores, slowing of metabolic rate and a decreased production of
growth hormone.31
Irregular or absent menses may have signiﬁcant emotional
impact creating anxiety and an altered perception of self-
normalcy.32 It may also confound conception, leading to unex-
pected pregnancy as well as inaccurate dating of pregnancy.
Long-term reproductive repercussions of RED-S for women and
men are unknown.
RED-S also has adverse health consequences for bone. Peak
bone mass occurs around 19 years in women and 20.5 years in
men.33 Oestrogen increases uptake of calcium into blood and
deposition into bone, while progesterone facilitates the actions
of oestrogen through multiple complex mechanisms.34 Even
silent oestrogen/progesterone imbalance, as seen in subclinical

ovulatory disturbances with low EA may produce negative
changes in bone.35 In men and women, testosterone has ana-
bolic effects on bone, stimulating osteoclasts and increasing
bone formation and calcium absorption.36 Low-testosterone
levels have been associated with low BMD in male athletes.37
Endogenous oestrogens and androgens have independent effects
on bone development in both sexes.38 39 Increases in the stress
hormones, catecholamines and cortisol, concomitant with low
EA, have a negative effect.40 The bones of athletes with chronic
amenorrhoea, beneﬁt less from the osteogenic effects of exer-
cise.41 Although low BMD was ﬁrst attributed to hypoestrogen-
ism of menstrual dysfunction, low EA is now recognised as an
independent factor of poor bone health at all levels of energy
deﬁciency due to decreased IgF-1 and bone formation markers
levels.42 Bone loss in these athletes may be irreversible.43
Changes in bone structure lead to an increased risk of stress
fractures.44 Dietary insufﬁciencies increase the risk of stress frac-
tures in both sexes.45 46 Additional risk factors include menstrual
dysfunction,47
compulsive
exercise,
underlying
poor
bone
health48 49 low body mass index, prior fracture50 and eating psy-
chopathology.49–51 High-risk stress fractures (ie, femoral neck)
occur in adolescent athletes with the RED-S, and can have
serious long-term consequences52 53 (ﬁgure 1). RED-S can also
affect athletic performance. Functional impairments associated
with low energy availability include a greater prevalence of viral
illnesses,55 injuries56 and most critically reduced responsiveness
to training and subsequent performance.57 Further studies of per-
formance effects of low energy availability are likely to provide
signiﬁcant incentive to change damaging behaviours. Such
studies should conﬁrm under which situations these effects occur
(ﬁgure 2). In addition, some athletes with disordered eating/
eating
disorders
practise
extreme weight
control
methods
(fasting, vomiting, diuretic and laxative abuse) that have possible
health and performance consequences such as dehydration and
electrolyte imbalances, and gastrointestinal problems, including
esophagitis
and
oesophageal
perforation
from
vomiting.
Diuretics and some diet pills may contain WADA prohibited
substances.58
Male athletes
Although there is a dearth of prevalence studies in low EA in
male athletes, Vogt et al59 showed that male cyclists had severely
reduced EA of 8 kcal/kg/FFM/day and Müller et al60 have
reported high prevalence of underweight international level ski
jumpers. Although male athletes are at lower risk for developing
DE/ED8 18 61 the prevalence in elite male athletes is high in
cycling (50%),62 gravitational (24%) and weight class sports
(18%).15 DE/EDs in male jockeys are associated with low
BMD.63 Even in the absence of DE/EDs, male endurance ath-
letes in running37 64 65 and in non-weight bearing sports such as
cycling,66–69 are at high risk for low BMD. Low EA alters endo-
crine function11 and direct and indirect impacts on bone may
occur in male athletes.70
Athletes of non-caucasian ethnicity
The prevalence of low EA has been studied mainly in females of
Caucasian, European or European American descent. Whether
race plays a role in the incidence and underlying aetiology of
the RED-S remains speculative.
Race is a signiﬁcant variable for several of the individual Triad
components in non-athletic women. For example, a lower risk of
ED is shown in African-American than Caucasian women,71 even
among adolescent athletes.72 Whether the prevalence of menstrual
disorders differs among racially diverse, athletic groups is currently
unknown. In non-athletes, menarche occurs signiﬁcantly earlier in
African-American than in Caucasian or European American
women.73 The BMD of African-American non-athletic females is
signiﬁcantly greater than that of Caucasian women, with a lower
risk of osteoporosis and fracture.74 In athletes, little is known

about the differences in BMD among ethnic groups, especially in
the presence of low EA, DE/EDs and hormonal and metabolic
imbalances. Stress fractures in African-American military recruits
are lower than in Caucasian recruits.75 Based on preliminary data
of a multicentre study, African-American and African black athletes
exhibit similar symptoms of low EA, with Caucasian athletes
showing greater risk of DE/EDs and menstrual dysfunction76 and
no advantage for BMD in African black athletes.77 There are no
published scientiﬁc studies in Hispanic and limited evidence on
Asian athletes.78
Athletes with a disability
At present there are no data available on low EA in athletes
with disabilities. Individuals with spinal cord injuries, suffer
from osteoporosis due to the lack of skeletal loading.79 While
no data exist on EA or DE/ED patterns in athletes with a disabil-
ity, their occurrence should not be overlooked. RED-S in ath-
letes with a disability should be taken seriously due to possible
comorbidities. Athletes with an amputation and who ambulate
may have additional energetic challenges due to the inefﬁciency
of movement,80 thus increasing their risk for inadvertent energy
deﬁciency.81
Screening and diagnosis
Relative energy deﬁciency and EDs in sport
The screening and diagnosis of RED-S is challenging, as symp-
tomatology can be subtle. A high index of suspicion of the
athlete at risk is needed. Early detection is crucial to improve
performance
and
prevent
long-term
health
consequences.
Screening for RED-S should be undertaken as part of an annual
Periodic Health Examination (PHE) and when an athlete pre-
sents with DE/ED, weight loss, lack of normal growth and
development, menstrual dysfunction, recurrent injuries and ill-
nesses, decreased performance or mood changes. Although
various screening instruments exist,16 82 83 they have not been
validated and there is no consensus on which screening tool has
the best efﬁcacy.84 85 Furthermore, these tools exclude men, dis-
abled athletes and are not ethnically diverse.
Since low EA plays a pivotal role in the development of the
RED-S, diagnosis should focus on identiﬁcation of the presence
and causes of the low EA. Unfortunately, there are no standar-
dised guidelines to determine EA. EA is equivalent to EI minus
the cost of exercise energy expenditure (EEE) relative to FFM or
lean body mass: EA (kcal/kg FFM/day) = (EI (kcal/day)−EEE
(kcal/day )) The measurement of each of these components
requires expertise and is generally imprecise. EI can be assessed
by retrospective (recall) or prospective (written or electronic
food diary) methods.86 EEE is usually assessed by an exercise log
and tables of energy expenditure associated with sports/exercise
activities, but may be supplemented where available by data col-
lected via modern sports technology (eg, Global Positioning
System Units, Heart Rate Monitors or Power Meters). Ideally, EI
and EEE are measured over a similar time period that is represen-
tative of habitual practices. FFM can be quantiﬁed by methods
such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and anthro-
pometry.87 A measurement of resting metabolic rate via indirect
calorimetry may provide conﬁrmation of suppressed metabolism
secondary to low EA. Underpinning factors related to an uninten-
tional mismatch between EI and large training/competition
volume, intensity or misguided weight loss practices may be rela-
tively easy to diagnose.
The
Brief
Eating
Disorder
in
Athletes
Questionnaire
(BEDA-Q) is a validated screening tool that shows promising
results in terms of distinguishing between female elite athletes
with and without ED/DE.88 The Gold Standard for the diagno-
sis of EDs is the Eating Disorder Examination interview
(EDE-16).89 For diagnostic criteria for ED see APA.16
Menstrual dysfunction
FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion. Assessment of irregular menses
should include a menstrual history assessing age of menarche,
regularity of menses, use of medications, the presence of other
health issues and a family menstrual history. Physical examination
includes assessment of anthropometry, pubertal stage, signs of
ED and secondary causes of amenorrhoea.83 Pelvic examination
may reveal pregnancy or hypoestrogen-related vaginal atrophy.
Laboratory assessment of haemoglobin, luteinising hormone, fol-
licle stimulating hormone, prolactin, oestradiol, T4, thyroid
stimulating hormone, pregnancy and androgen proﬁle may be
indicated. More extensive testing might include a pelvic ultra-
sound and endometrial sampling to rule out other gynaecological
pathologies.
Bone health
In athletes with low EA, DE, ED or amenorrhoea of over
6 months, BMD should be measured by DXA.90 91 In the ado-
lescent, DXA should include the whole body (head excluded) in
addition to the lumbar spine.6 92 As athletes in weight-bearing
sports should have 5–15% higher BMD than non-athletes93 94 a
BMD Z-score <−1.0 SD warrants further attention. In the
athlete population, low BMD is deﬁned as a Z-score between
−1.0 and −2.0 SD, together with a history of nutritional deﬁ-
ciencies, hypoestrogenism, stress fracture or other secondary
clinical risk factors for fracture. A value below −2.0 SD is con-
sidered as osteoporosis with the presence of secondary clinical
risk factors.6 The recommended interval to reassess BMD via
DXA scan for athletes at risk, or who are being treated for low
BMD is 12 months in adults and a minimum of 6 months in
adolescents.95
Treatment strategies of RED-S
Treatment strategies for low EA
The treatment of low EA should involve an increase in EI,
reduction in exercise or a combination of both. The only strat-
egy to have received scientiﬁc scrutiny is the addition of an
energy-rich supplement (eg, liquid meal product) to habitual
intake and a small reduction in, or introduction of a rest day to
the weekly training programme.96–98 Despite the small sample
size, this intervention was successful,96 97 however, not in all
studies98 as this strategy may fail to address many underlying
dietary and psychological factors. While developing a strategy to
implement a diet of known and appropriate EA may be logical,
it is usually impractical due to the challenges of measuring EA
in the ﬁeld. Therefore, a practical treatment approach to address
low EA is to implement an eating plan that increases current EI
by ∼300–600 kcal/day (1.2–2.4 MJ/day) and addresses subopti-
mal practices related to energy spread over the day and around
exercise sessions, dietary composition and food-related stress.
Treatment strategies for low EA-associated menstrual dysfunction
In collegiate athletes, weight gain is the strongest predictor of
recovery of normal menstrual function.99–101 Adequate protein
and carbohydrate intake is recommended to restore liver glycogen
to facilitate LH pulsatility.31 102 The time frame for the resumption
of menses varies according to the severity of the energy deﬁciency
and the duration of the menstrual dysfunction.100
Although oral contraceptives (OCs) may be considered for
athletes requiring contraception,103 these may mask the low EA,

menstrual dysfunction and perpetuate bone loss. Injectable
depot medroxyprogesterone, another form of contraception,
can cause amenorrhoea and hence prolonged use can adversely
affect BMD,104 and adolescent bone mass accrual,105 which is
reversible to a certain extent on discontinuation.106 Many physi-
cians prescribe low-dose OCs as hormone replacement in the
amenorrheic athlete, however, this intervention does not correct
the aetiological cause of relative energy deﬁciency and may com-
promise the attainment of peak bone density.107
Treatment options to restore fertility may include increasing
EA. Pharmacological agents may be necessary to stimulate ovu-
lation in luteal phase deﬁciency.27 Attention must be paid to
infertility treatments identiﬁed in the WADA Prohibited List.58
Treatment strategies to optimise bone health
Strategies to reverse bone loss in women with FHA parallel
those used for amenorrheic women with anorexia.108 In the
latter population, weight gain with or without the subsequent
resumption of menses restores the coupling of bone formation
and resporption109 110 and improves BMD.109 However, full
recovery may not be feasible, as bone microarchitecture is also
impaired.111 EI alone increases bone mass by 1–10% in women
with anorexia.110 112 It is essential to restore the energy and
oestrogen-dependent mechanisms of bone loss in order to
improve mineralisation of trabecular bone and growth of cor-
tical bone.41 Mechanical loading and high-impact sports are
known to positively affect BMD113 114 as well as bone geom-
etry.115 116 Programmes of high-impact loading and resistance
training should be implemented at least 2–3 days/week for ath-
letes in non-weight bearing sports and/or those with decreased
BMD.6
The athlete diet should include 1500 mg/day of calcium
through dietary sources with supplementation if required.117
The Endocrine Society Guideline (2011) recommends maintain-
ing vitamin D [25(OH)D] blood levels above 32–50 ng/mL,
with 1500–2000 IU/day of vitamin D.118 119 Vitamin D deﬁ-
ciency is common in northern latitudes, especially during winter
when there are fewer hours of sunlight and among athletes who
train indoors.120 121 Other factors include dark pigmented skin,
and the use of sunscreen. A recent meta-analysis of vitamin D
supplementation found a positive effect in femoral and hip
BMD, with no effect in the spine.122
Transdermal oestradiol (given with cyclic progesterone) has
shown some success in increasing BMD in patients with anor-
exia.123 In some studies, combination OCs containing 20–35 mg
of oestradiol have maintained or improved BMD in amenor-
rheic athletes.124 125 However, use of the OCP in athletes with
FHA have been reported to have a detrimental effect on BMD
through the suppression of androgen secretion and cause prema-
ture closure of the epiphyses compromising growth of the long
bones in adolescents.126
Bisphosphonates, which inhibit the resorption of bone, are
not recommended for women of reproductive age, as they are
stored in bone for prolonged amounts of time and have been
shown to be teratogenic.127 128 Other therapies including raloxi-
fene (a selective oestrogen receptor modulator or SERM), para-
thyroid hormone peptides, teriperatide and calcitonin, are also
not approved for use in premenopausal women. Some novel
potential therapies are being developed, but clinical trials are
lacking.129 130 These include insulin-derived growth factor (a
bone anabolic agent)131 132 and leptin which can be used to
stimulate appetite, thus effecting resumption of menses and sub-
sequent improvement in BMD.133–135
In men, detection and correction of any underlying pathology
is essential, including testosterone therapy with hypogonadism
and osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates may be used as monother-
apy, as consolidative therapy after a course of teriperatide
administration
or
in
combination
with
hormonal
replace-
ment.136 Denusomab and strontium ranelate also increase BMD
in men with osteoporosis.137
Treatment strategies for psychological sequelae
If an athlete will not or cannot follow the treatment plan, a psy-
chological factor is generally present. Athlete resistance to treat-
ment
usually
increases
with
the
severity
of
the
eating
problem.138 Treatment should be provided by a mental health
professional knowledgeable about the management of EDs in
athletes. The frequency, types, intensity and duration of psycho-
logical treatment depend on the severity, chronicity and the
medical and psychological complications of the eating problem,

as well as the comorbid psychological disorders that often
accompany such problems. Ideally, eating problems can be
treated on an outpatient basis. Medical complications, risk of
self-harm and lack of progress in outpatient treatment indicate a
need for more intensive treatment regimens including inpatient,
residential, partial hospitalisation and intensive outpatient pro-
grammes. Treatment is usually required for several months.
Treatment
modalities
might
include
cognitive
behavioural
therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy or family-based therapy.
Comorbid conditions, such as depression, anxiety and other
psychological
problems
also
need
to
be
addressed.
Pharmacotherapy may also be recommended; antidepressants
are the class of medications most often prescribed.139
Clinical models for sport participation and return-to-play
Risk assessment for sport participation
There are limited evidence-based guidelines to assist the athlete
healthcare team in the assessment for sport participation clearance
with RED-S. Based on the guidelines from the Norwegian
Olympic Training Center140 and the collective expertise of the
IOC Consensus group, a new model of criteria to assess risk for
sport participation has been developed (table 1). This model can
be incorporated into the PHE. The criteria for this model are
based on those used at the Norwegian Olympic Training
Center,140 and also recommended by the IOC Body Composition,
Health and Performance Working group.8
It is recommended that athletes in the ‘High Risk—Red
Light’ risk category should not be cleared to participate in
sport. Owing to the severity of their clinical presentation, sport
participation may pose serious jeopardy to their health and
may also distract the athlete from devoting the attention
needed for treatment and recovery.138 These athletes should
receive treatment using a written treatment contract (see online
supplementary appendix 1). Athletes in the ‘Moderate Risk—
Yellow Light’ risk category should be cleared for sport partici-
pation only with supervised participation and a medical treat-
ment plan. Re-evaluation of the athlete’s risk assessment should
occur at regular intervals of 1–3 months depending on the clin-
ical scenario to assess compliance and to detect changes in clin-
ical status.
Return-to-play
Decision-making regarding return-to-play (RTP) following time
away from sport for recovery from injury and/or illness is
based on the assessment of the athlete’s health and the require-
ments of his/her sport.143 144 Table 3 adapts Creightons’s RTP
Model and the guidelines from the Norwegian group140 to the
athlete with RED-S through the addition of RED-S speciﬁc
criteria.
The RED-S Risk Assessment Model is adapted to aid clini-
cians’ decision-making for determining an athlete’s readiness to
return to sport. Following clinical reassessment utilising the
three-step evaluation outlined in table 2, athletes can be reclassi-
ﬁed into the ‘High Risk—Red Light’, ‘Moderate Risk—Yellow
Light’ or ‘Low Risk—Green Light’ categories. The RED-S
return-to-play model (table 3) outlines the sport activity recom-
mended for each risk category.
Recommendations to address RED-S
The following recommendations are formulated based on a
review of the scientiﬁc evidence and the collective expertise of
the IOC Consensus group relating to the RED-S.
Athlete entourage recommendations
The athlete’s entourage can prevent RED-S through implemen-
tation of the following strategies:

▸Educational programmes on RED-S, healthy eating, nutri-
tion, EA, the risks of dieting and how these affect health and
performance.
▸Reduction of emphasis on weight, emphasising nutrition and
health as a means to enhance performance.
▸Development of realistic and health-promoting goals related
to weight and body composition.
▸Avoidance of critical comments about an athlete’s body
shape/weight.
▸Use of reputable sources of information.
▸Promotion of awareness that good performance does not
always mean the athlete is healthy.
▸Encouragement and support of appropriate, timely and
effective treatment.
Healthcare professional recommendations
HealthCare professionals can decrease the health implications of
RED-S through the following interventions:
▸Identiﬁcation of a multidisciplinary athlete health support
team including sports physician, nutritionist, psychologist,
physiotherapist and physiologist.
▸Education of the medical team in the detection and treat-
ment of the RED-S.
▸Implementation of the RED-S Risk Assessment Model in the
PHE and the RED-S RTP Model.
Sport organisation recommendations
Sport organisations such as International Federations, National
Olympic
Committees
and
National
Sport
Federations can
prevent RED-S through the implementation of:
▸Preventative educational programmes;
▸Rule modiﬁcations/changes to address weight-sensitive issues
in sport;
▸Policies for coaches on the healthy practice of managing
athlete eating behaviour, weight and body composition.
Research recommendations
Research institutions should focus on research and evaluation
of:
▸The aetiology and treatment of athletes with RED-S includ-
ing males, ethnic and disabled populations;
▸Design and validation of tools to accurately measure EA in
the clinical setting;
▸The validation of screening tools and treatment programmes
such as the RED-S Risk Assessment Model and RED-S RTP
Model.
What is already known on this topic?
▸The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has published a
Consensus Statement and Position Stand (2005) on the
Female Athlete Triad outlining the pathophysiology and
prevalence of this syndrome.
▸Low energy availability is the aetiological
process underpinning the development of the Female
Athlete Triad.
▸Prevalence measures of the Triad indicate that female
athletes are particularly vulnerable to this syndrome in
sports where leanness and/or weight are important due to
their role in performance, appearance or requirement to
meet a competition weight category.
How might this IOC consensus statement impact on
clinical practice in the near future?
▸Scientiﬁc evidence and clinical experience around the effects
of low energy availability shows that several body systems in
addition to the reproductive and musculoskeletal systems are
affected, and that men are at risk as well as women.
▸Based on the evidence, a broader term, which includes what
has so far been called the ‘Female Athlete Triad’, is
introduced: Relative Energy Deﬁciency in Sport (RED-S).
▸Owing to the potential serious health consequences of this
syndrome, there is a need in the clinical realm to establish a
‘Sport Risk Assessment’ model to protect the health and
well-being of athletes with this syndrome.
▸‘Return-to-Play’ guidelines will assist the athlete health
support team in the safe return of the affected athlete to
sport participation.
▸Recommendations for sport organisations, athlete entourage
and research institutions will result in future awareness,
understanding and further evidence-based knowledge of the
RED-S.
