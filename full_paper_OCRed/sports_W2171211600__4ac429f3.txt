Abstract
The effect of an acute bout of moderate treadmill walking on behavioral and neuroelectric indices
of the cognitive control of attention and applied aspects of cognition involved in school-based
academic performance were assessed. A within-subjects design included twenty preadolescent
participants (Age = 9.5 ± 0.5 years; 8 female) to assess exercise-induced changes in performance
during a modified flanker task and the Wide Range Achievement Test 3. The resting session consisted
of cognitive testing followed by a cardiorespiratory fitness assessment to determine aerobic fitness.
The exercise session consisted of 20 minutes of walking on a motor-driven treadmill at 60% of
estimated maximum heart rate followed by cognitive testing once heart rate returned to within 10%
of pre-exercise levels. Results indicated an improvement in response accuracy, larger P3 amplitude,
and better performance on the academic achievement test following aerobic exercise relative to the
resting session. Collectively, these findings indicate that single, acute bouts of moderately-intense
aerobic exercise (i.e., walking) may improve the cognitive control of attention in preadolescent
children, and further supports the use of moderate acute exercise as a contributing factor for increasing
attention and academic performance. These data suggest that single bouts of exercise affect specific
underlying processes that support cognitive health and may be necessary for effective functioning
across the lifespan.

exercise benefit a host of cognitive processes (see Hillman, Erickson, and Kramer, 2008 for
review). Interestingly, the majority of research has focused on adult populations, with a more
recent focus turning toward child populations. Reviews of early studies testing this relationship
suggests that school age children also may derive cognitive benefits from physical activity
participation (Sibley and Etnier, 2003; Tomporowski, 2003b). Preadolescent children provide
a unique population in which to study physical activity effects on cognition, as researchers are
afforded the opportunity to link basic cognitive functions, often measured in the laboratory,
with applied aspects of cognition, routinely measured in the schools.
One such aspect of applied cognitive performance is academic achievement. Recent federal
mandates have placed an increased importance upon students’ performance on academic
achievement tests. Thus, school districts have begun altering their curricula to better provide
students with the necessary means to improve their test performance. These curricula changes
have come at the cost of non-academic subject matters including reduced instruction time in
physical education, arts, and music.
However, Castelli, Hillman, Buck, and Erwin (2007) observed a positive relation between
fitness and standardized achievement test performance on mathematics and reading in third
and fifth grade children. The results indicated that aerobic fitness was positively related, body
mass index was negatively related, and muscle strength and flexibility fitness were unrelated
with achievement test performance, suggesting a differential relation between the various
aspects of fitness and scholastic performance. Further, Coe and her colleagues (Coe, Pivarnik,
Womack, Reeves, and Malina, 2006) administered a 3-day physical activity recall
questionnaire to sixth grade children and observed academic performance in four core classes
(i.e., mathematics, science, English, world studies) and Terra Nova standardize test scores.
They found increased performance in core academic classes for those children who reported
vigorous physical activity outside of school relative to those who reported no physical activity
(Coe et al., 2006). Several other studies have appeared in the literature as well, indicating
positive relations between physical activity and aspects of academic performance (Fields,
Diego, and Sanders, 2001;Kim et al., 2003; Lindner, 2002). Although several studies have also
observed no relation between physical activity and academic performance (Tomporowski,
Davis, Miller, and Naglieri, 2008), no published reports exist suggesting a negative relationship
between these factors, indicating that, at the very least, time spent performing physical activity
does not hinder academic performance and may lead to improved physical and mental health.
To date, few reports are available (e.g., Mahar et al., 2006) on the relation between single,
acute bouts of physical activity and performance on academic achievement tests.
Even less is known about the underlying aspects of cognition that are influenced by acute bouts
of activity and their relation to applied academic achievement. A recent study indicated that
attention and concentration are enhanced following acute bouts of either coordinative exercise
or normal sport lessons provided in physical education class in adolescent children (Budde,
Voelcker-Rehage, Pietraßyk-Kendziorra, Ribeiro, and Tidow, 2008). However, other research
examining a different aspect of cognition (i.e., cognitive flexibility) failed to obtain a beneficial
effect of acute aerobic exercise (Tomporowski, Davis, Lambourne, Gregoski, and Tkacz,
2008). Research examining chronic physical activity participation has suggested improved
cognitive performance on attentionally demanding tasks in preadolescent children (Buck,
Hillman, and Castelli, 2008; Castelli et al., 2007; Davis et al., 2007; Hillman, Castelli, and
Buck, 2005; Hillman, Buck, Themanson, Pontifex, and Castelli, 2009).
Several reports have also observed positive effects of acute exercise on adult cognition (see
Tomporowski, 2003a for review). In a subset of these reports, event-related brain potential
(ERPs) measures have been collected to assess neuroelectric changes that may underlie
cognitive performance. This approach offers the requisite temporal precision to gain insight

into covert cognitive operations that occur between stimulus engagement and response
selection, which may be more sensitive to these processes than overt behavioral measures of
task performance. ERPs refer to patterns of neuroelectric activation that occur in response to,
or in preparation for, a stimulus or response. Previous studies have examined the P3 component
of the stimulus-locked ERP to understand alterations in stimulus engagement. That is, the
amplitude of the P3 is believed to index the allocation of attentional resources during stimulus
engagement, with greater amplitude indicative of greater resource allocation (Polich, 1987).
The latency of the P3 is thought to index stimulus classification and evaluation speed with
increased latency reflecting longer processing time (Duncan-Johnson, 1981). Prior studies
examining acute exercise effects on the P3 have observed increased amplitude (Kamijo et al.,
2004) and shorter latency (Hillman, Snook, and Jerome, 2003) following single, acute bouts
of moderately-intense exercise relative to a basal state. Accordingly, the findings have been
interpreted to suggest an exercise-induced facilitation of attentional resource allocation and
stimulus evaluation speed during tasks requiring the cognitive control of inhibition.
Cognitive control is a term used to describe a subset of goal-directed, self regulatory operations
involved in the selection, scheduling, and coordination of computational processes underlying
perception, memory, and action. Core cognitive processes collectively termed ‘cognitive
control’ or ‘executive control’ include inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility
(Diamond, 2006). Of these core processes, inhibition has been most studied in the acute
exercise literature (e.g., Hillman et al., 2003; Kamijo et al., 2004) and relates to the ability to
act on the basis of choice rather than impulse (Davidson, Amso, Anderson, and Diamond,
2006). That is, inhibitory control often requires one to override a strong internal or external
pull to appropriately perform a necessary task (Davidson et al., 2006). The ability to inhibit
attention to task irrelevant or distracting stimuli is central to the ability to sustain attention and
allow control over one’s actions. Such abilities exhibit protracted development relative to other
cognitive processes (Diamond, 2006).
The brain regions supporting inhibitory processes include the prefrontal (including the anterior
cingulate cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex), temporal, and parietal cortices (Bush, Luu, and
Posner, 2000; Carter, Mintun, and Cohen, 1995; Taylor, Kornblum, Lauber, Minoshima, and
Koeppe, 1997). This network of brain regions has been shown to exhibit a more protracted
development relative to other networks and likely relates to the delayed developmental
trajectory of the cognitive processes mediated by it (Bunge, Dudukovic, Thomason, Vaidya,
and Gabrieli, 2002). Despite the delayed maturation of this network, young children have been
observed to perform inhibitory tasks with reasonable levels of success. Children as young as
age four exhibit the goal directed, self-regulatory behaviors required to inhibit their attention
and actions when necessary (Davidson et al., 2006; Mezzacappa, 2004). The relevance of the
development of such behavior has been made obvious through research that provided a
cognitive control intervention to preschool children and demonstrated gains in academic
performance (Diamond, Barnett, Thomas, and Munro, 2007). Mathematics and reading
performance have also been linked to the prefrontal and parietal network (Maguire, Frith, and
Morris, 1999). Specifically, mathematical calculations and numerical magnitude processing
has been found to activate bilateral regions of the intraparietal sulcus in children and adults
(Ansari and Dhital, 2006; Gobel, Johansen-Berg, Behrens, and Rushworth, 2004; Rivera,
Reiss, Eckert, and Menon, 2005), as well as the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in children
(Ansari and Dhital, 2006). Thus, similarities exist in the neural networks that underlie cognitive
control and academic achievement.
Interestingly, in adult populations physical activity effects on cognition have been found to
exhibit a disproportionately larger benefit to tasks or task components requiring extensive
amounts of cognitive control (Angevaren, Aufdemkampe, Verhaar, Aleman, and Vanhees,
2008; Colcombe and Kramer, 2003), with corroborating evidence from imaging studies

indicating selective increases in gray and white matter volume in the prefrontal, temporal, and
parietal cortices (Colcombe et al., 2004, 2006; Erickson et al. in press), suggesting that these
regions are particularly susceptible to intervention. Further, selective changes in the P3
component to an inhibitory control task following acute exercise suggest that single bouts of
exercise may increase attentional resource allocation and improve cognitive processing speed
in adults (Hillman et al., 2003). To date, no such relationship has been established in the
literature in preadolescent populations; thus the extension of the findings within adult
populations to children is speculative. However, given the protracted development of -- and
the observed physical activity benefits to -- the neural network underlying attentional
inhibition, an acute exercise effect on inhibitory control would be expected.
Accordingly, the effect of a single, acute bout of exercise on preadolescent children’s
neurocognitive function was examined during performance on a modified Eriksen flanker task
(Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974) requiring variable amounts of inhibitory control, and on a series
of standardized achievement tests related to reading, spelling, and mathematics. The
examination of acute exercise on inhibitory control in children extends prior research in adults
(e.g., Hillman et al., 2003). Thus, it was predicted that relative to a baseline condition, children
would exhibit larger P3 amplitude following acute exercise, indicative of enhance attentional
allocation, and shorter P3 latency, indicative of faster cognitive processing speed. These acute
exercise effects were expected to be larger during task components placing larger demands
upon the attentional control network. Additionally, the focus on academic achievement extends
prior preadolescent studies examining changes in scholastic performance (Caterino & Polak,
1999; Gabbard, & Barton, 1979; McNaughten & Gabbard, 1993) following participation in
structured physical activities. It was predicted that children would exhibit increased
performance on academic achievement tests following acute exercise due to the established
relationship between single bouts of physical activity and enhanced performance on tasks
requiring cognitive and attentional control.
Experimental Procedures
Participants
Table 1 provides the demographic and fitness data for all participants. Twenty right-handed
preadolescent children from the east-central Illinois region were recruited to serve as
participants. All participants provided written assent and their legal guardians provided written
informed consent in accordance with the Institutional Review Board of the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prior to testing, legal guardians’ completed a health history and
demographics questionnaire, reported that their child was free of neurological diseases,
attentional disorders (as indexed by scores below 14 and 22 for females and males, respectively
on the ADHD Rating Scale IV), or physical disabilities, and indicated normal or corrected to
normal vision based on the minimal 20/20 standard. They further reported that their child did
not have any condition that would be exacerbated by physical exercise using the Physical
Activity Readiness Questionnaire (Thomas, Reading, and Shephard, 1992), and socioeconomic
status (SES) was determined using a trichotomous index based on: a) participation in free or
reduced-price lunch program at school, b) the highest level of education obtained by the mother
and father, and c) number of parents who worked full-time (Birnbaum et al., 2002). Participants,
in collaboration with their legal guardian, completed the Tanner Staging System (Tanner,
1962), indicating that their pubertal status was at or below a score of 2 (i.e., prepubescent) on
the 4-point scale. Additionally, children were administered the Kaufman Brief Intelligence
Test (K-BIT; Kaufman and Kaufman, 1990) by a trained experimenter to assess intelligence
quotient, and completed the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971) to determine
hand dominance.

Modified Flanker Task—Participants completed a modified flanker task (Eriksen and
Eriksen, 1974; Hillman et al., 2006; Pontifex and Hillman, 2007) to assess inhibitory control.
Congruent and incongruent trials require participants to press a button corresponding to the
direction of the centrally presented target arrow. Congruent trials consisted of an array of five
arrows facing the same direction (e.g., ≪≪< or "≫"≫>) and incongruent trials consisted of
the four flanking arrows facing the opposite direction to that of the target arrow (e.g., "≫<"≫
or ≪>≪). Following the provision of task instructions, participants were afforded the
opportunity to ask questions and 20 practice trials were administered prior to the start of testing.
The experimenter observed participants during the practice trials and checked their
performance to ensure that they understood the task. If a participant’s task performance was
below 60%, another 20 practice trials were administered. All participants performed adequately
following the second set of practice trials. Participants were administered two blocks of 100
trials, consisting of equiprobable congruency and directionality. Stimuli were 2.5 cm tall white
arrows presented focally for 120 ms on a black background with a response window of 1000
ms and a variable inter-stimulus interval of 1100, 1300, or 1500 ms. Total task duration was
approximately 7.5 minutes including a 2.5 minute rest between task blocks. This task allows
not only for measures of response speed and accuracy, but also for changes in the speed and
accuracy of information processing across the two conditions through the calculation of
interference scores. These scores require simple subtractions across task conditions to yield
the difference in performance between congruent and incongruent trials (Fan, McCandliss,
Fossella, Flombaum, & Posner, 2005).
Electroencephalogram—Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded from 64
electrode sites labeled according to the international 10–10 system (Chatrian, Lettich, and
Nelson, 1985) using a Neuroscan Quik-cap referenced to average mastoids, with AFz serving
as the ground electrode. Electro-oculographic (EOG) activity was recorded using additional
electrodes placed above and below the left orbit and on the outer canthus of each eye.
Continuous data were digitized at a sampling rate of 500 Hz, amplified 500× with a DC to 70
Hz filter, and a 60 Hz notch filter was applied using a Neuroscan Synamps amplifier. Prior to
testing all electrodes had an impedance < 10kΩ.
Offline data reduction included EOG correction using a spatial filter (Compumedics
Neuroscan, 2003) and rejection of trials with a response error or artifact exceeding ±75 μV.
Stimulus-locked epochs were created from −100 to 1000 ms around the stimuli. Baseline
correction occurred using the 100 ms pre-stimulus period and the data were filtered using a
zero phase shift 30 Hz (24 dB/octave) low pass filter. The P3 component was quantified as the
maximum positive deflections occurring within a 300–600 ms latency window. Peak data were
outputted in ASCII format and analyzed using SPSS 15.0.
Academic Achievement Assessment—Participants completed the Wide Range
Achievement Test - 3rd edition (WRAT3; Wide Range, Inc., Wilmington, DE) to assess
academic achievement in the content areas of reading (i.e., the number of words correctly
pronounced aloud), spelling (i.e., the number of words correctly spelled), and arithmetic (i.e.,
the number of mathematical problems correctly solved). The WRAT3 is a paper and pencil
based academic achievement assessment that has been age-normed referenced and has been
strongly correlated with the California Achievement Test – Form E and the Stanford
Achievement Test (Wilkinson, 1993). The WRAT3 allows for repeated administration through
the use of two equivalent forms designed specifically for pre- and post- intervention testing
(Wilkinson, 1993). Administration of the WRAT3 was conducted individually by trained
experimenters with the duration of the assessment taking 15–20 minutes.
Cardiorespiratory fitness assessment—Cardiorespiratory fitness data is listed in Table
1. Maximal oxygen consumption (V̇O2max) was measured using a computerized indirect

calorimetry system (ParvoMedics True Max 2400) with averages for oxygen uptake (V̇O2)
and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) assessed every 30 seconds. A modified Balke protocol
(ACSM, 2005) was employed using a motor-driven treadmill at a constant speed with increases
in grade increments of 2.5% every two minutes until volitional exhaustion occurred. A Polar
heart rate monitor (Model A1, Polar Electro, Finland) was used to measure HR throughout the
test and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were assessed every two minutes using the
children’s OMNI scale (Utter et al., 2002). The children’s OMNI scale for RPE uses a
numerical scale from 0 to 10, with a score of 2 indicating “a little tired” and a score of 9
indicating “very, very tired”, with associated pictographs to represent perceived physical effort.
Relative peak oxygen consumption was expressed in ml/kg/min and was based upon maximal
effort as evidenced by 1) a peak heart rate ≥ 185 bpm (ACSM, 2005) and a heart rate plateau
(Freedson and Goodman, 1993); 2) RER ≥ 1.0 (Bar-Or, 1983); and/or 3) ratings on the
children’s OMNI scale of perceived exertion ≥ 8 (Utter et al., 2002). Cardiorespiratory fitness
data is listed in Table 1.
Procedure
A within-subjects design had participants visit the laboratory on two separate days (10.6 ± 9.4
days between sessions) in which they had not participated in physical education or other
structured physical activity (e.g., youth sport involvement). Both visits occurred at the same
time of day. During the first visit, participants and their legal guardians completed all
paperwork including written informed assent/consent as described above. They were then
outfitted with a heart rate monitor (Model A1, Polar Electro, Finland) and their resting heart
rate was recorded after 5 minutes of seated rest. Participants were counterbalanced into two
different experimental conditions such that half of the participants received the resting session
on the first day and the aerobic exercise session on the second day. The other half received the
aerobic exercise session on the first day and the resting session on the second day. The resting
session consisted of 20 minutes of seated rest, during which time the legal guardian was present
and conversation was kept to a minimum. Following the seated rest period, participants were
outfitted with the electrode cap prior to administration of the modified flanker task (M = 24.1
± 6.0 minutes post seated rest). After the completion of this task, the electrode cap was removed
and the WRAT3 was administered. Upon completion of all cognitive testing participants
performed a cardiorespiratory fitness assessment to determine aerobic fitness. The aerobic
exercise session consisted of 20 minutes of aerobic exercise on a motor-driven treadmill at
60% of their estimated maximum heart rate (HRmax; 220-age). Mean HR for this intensity was
125.4 ± 1.0 bpm which equated to 65.7 ± 0.9 % of actual HRmax. Following the completion of
the acute exercise bout, participants were outfitted with an electrode cap and once their heart
rate (HR) returned to within 10% of their pre-exercise levels (M = 25.4 ± 6.7 minutes post
exercise) the modified flanker task was performed. Following completion of the flanker task,
the electrode cap was removed and the WRAT3 was administered. Upon completion of both
visits, participants and their legal guardians were briefed on the purpose of the experiment and
receive $40 remuneration ($10/hour) for their involvement in the experiment.
Statistical Analysis
Preliminary analyses were conducted to examine the order in which the sessions occurred to
ensure that the observed effects were not due to the specific order in which participants received
the exercise and rest conditions. These analyses employed an additional between-subjects
variable with two levels (Session Order: Rest, Aerobic Exercise vs. Aerobic Exercise, Rest) to
the analyses described below for each dependent measure.
Academic achievement was tested using paired sample t tests of Session for each academic
achievement subject (i.e., reading, spelling, mathematics). Analyses were conducted separately
for task performance measures (RT and response accuracy) using a 2 (Session: Exercise, Rest)

× 2 (Task Congruency: Congruent, Incongruent) repeated measures ANOVA. Secondary
analyses examined interference scores using paired sample t tests of Session, which calculate
the difference in speed or accuracy between flanker congruent and incongruent trials.
P3 analyses were conducted using 45 electrode sites (nine coronal sites within each of five
regions). P3 values (amplitude, latency) were submitted to a 2 (Session) × 2 (Task Congruency)
× 5 (Region: Frontal, Fronto-Central, Central, Centro-Parietal, Parietal) × 9 (Site: 7, 5, 3, 1, z,
2, 4, 6, 8) repeated measures ANOVA. Analyses with three or more within-subject levels used
the Greenhouse-Geisser statistic with subsidiary univariate ANOVAs and Bonferroni corrected
t tests used for post hoc comparisons. The family-wise alpha level was set at .05.
Results
Session Order
Preliminary analyses were performed to test whether the Session Order, which was
counterbalanced across participants, had an effect on any of the dependent variables. Findings
revealed no significant main effect or interaction involving Session Order for any variable,
F’s (1, 18) ≤ 2.2, p ≥ .15, η2 ≤.11. Thus, all further analyses were collapsed across Session
Order.
Achievement Test Performance
Analyses conducted on the three subtests of the WRAT3 indicated significantly better
performance for reading comprehension following acute exercise relative to rest, t(1, 19) =
2.6, p = .016 (see Figure 1). No such effect was observed for spelling or arithmetic (p’s > .39).
Task Performance
RT. The omnibus analysis for RT indicated a Congruency effect, F(1, 19) = 139.1, p < .001,
η2 = .88, with shorter RT for congruent (M = 493.1, SE = 12.8) relative to incongruent trials
(M = 552.6, SE = 12.0). No effects of Session were observed, p > .24 (see Figure 2). A secondary
analysis of the interference effects (incongruent-congruent) for each Session also yielded non-
significant differences between acute exercise (M = 55.0, SE = 5.1) and rest (M = 64.1, SE =
7.3), p = .24.
Response Accuracy—The omnibus analysis indicated effects of Session, F(1, 19) = 8.8,
p < .01, η2 = .32, and Congruency, F(1, 19) = 53.3, p < .001, η2 = .74, that were superseded
by a Session × Congruency interaction, F(1, 19) = 5.1, p < .05, η2 = .21. Decomposition of the
significant 2-way interaction yielded increased response accuracy following acute exercise
relative to rest only during incongruent trials, t(1, 19) = 3.0, p = .008. Although a similar effect
was observed for the congruent condition, it was considered non-significant following the
Bonferroni correction, t(1, 19) = 2.1, p = .05 (see Figure 2). The secondary analysis comparing
the interference effect (congruent – incongruent) indicated a significantly smaller difference
between flanker task congruencies following acute exercise (M = 5.6, SE = 1.0) relative to rest
(M = 10.3, SE = 1.9), t(1, 19) = 2.3, p < .05.
Event-Related Brain Potentials
Figure 3 depicts the stimulus-locked ERP waveforms across session and task congruency.
P3 Amplitude—The omnibus analysis evidenced main effects of Session, F(1, 19) = 8.0, p
= .01, η2 = .30, Region, F(1.9, 36.1) = 39.1, p < .001, η2 = .67, and Site, F(3.4, 63.6) = 13.6,
p < .001, η2 = .42, and 2-way interactions of Congruency × Region, F(2.9, 55.1) = 5.0, p < .
005, η2 = .21, and Region × Site, F(6.5, 124.2) = 2.7, p = .01, η2 = .13. However, these analyses

were superseded by 3-way interactions of Session × Congruency × Region, F(2.1, 39.2) = 3.1,
p = .05, η2 = .14, and Session × Congruency × Site, F(3.4, 65.1) = 4.2, p < .01, η2 = .18.
Decomposition of the Session × Congruency × Region interaction examined Session ×
Congruency within each of the five regions. The subsidiary ANOVA for the frontal region
yielded a Congruency effect, F(1, 19) = 5.1, p < .05, η2 = .21, with increased amplitude for
incongruent (M = 4.7, SE = .49) relative to congruent (M = 3.9, SE = .56) trials. The fronto-
central region revealed effects of Session, F(1, 19) = 5.8, p < .03, η2 = .23, and Congruency,
F(1, 19) = 7.5, p = .01, η2 = .28, with greater amplitude exhibited following acute exercise (M
= 5.5, SE = .68) and for incongruent trials (M = 5.1, SE = .53) relative to rest (M = 3.7, SE = .
58) and congruent trials (M = 4.1, SE = .55), respectively. The central region yielded a Session
main effect, F(1, 19) = 4.9, p < .04, η2 = .21, with greater amplitude following acute exercise
(M = 6.5, SE = .60) relative to rest (M = 4.8, SE = .72). The centro-parietal region yielded a
Session effect, F(1, 19) = 8.0, p = .01, η2 = .30, that was superseded by a Session × Congruency
interaction, F(1, 19) = 4.3, p = .04, η2 = .20. Post hoc t tests indicated larger amplitude following
acute exercise relative to rest for incongruent trials, t(1, 19) = 3.0, p = .007. A similar effect
was observed for congruent trials, but was considered non-significant following Bonferroni
correction, t(1, 19) = 2.4, p > .025 (see Figure 4). Lastly, for the parietal region, a Session effect
was observed, F(1, 19) = 10.0, p = .005, η2 = .34, with increased amplitude following acute
exercise (M = 8.6, SE = .82) relative to rest (M = 5.5, SE = .93).
Decomposition of the Session × Congruency × Site interaction examined Session ×
Congruency within each of the nine sites. A main effect of Session was observed at the left
lateral (7, 5), left medial (3, 1), midline (z), and right medial (2, 4) sites, F(1, 19) > 5.3, p ≤ .
03, η2 ≥ .22, indicating increased P3 amplitude following acute exercise relative to rest. At the
left medial sites (3, 1), the Session main effect was superseded by and Session × Congruency
interaction, F(1, 19) > 6.9, p < .04, η2 > .21. Decomposition of this interaction indicated
increased amplitude following acute exercise relative to rest only during incongruent trials, t
(1, 19) ≥ 2.9, p ≤ .01 (see Figure 4). No such effect was observed during congruent trials
following Bonferroni correction (p > .035). In addition, main effects of Congruency were
observed along midline (z) and right medial (2) sites, F(1, 19) ≥ 4.6, p < .05, η2 ≥ .20, with
increased amplitude for incongruent relative to congruent trials. No significant effects were
observed at the right lateral sites (6, 8).
P3 Latency—The omnibus analysis revealed main effects of Congruency, F(1, 19) = 6.3, p
= .02, η2 = .25, and Region, F(1.8, 34.6) = 13.3, p < .001, η2 = .41, which were superseded by
two 2-way interactions of Congruency × Region, F(1.8, 34.1) = 4.2, p < .03, η2 = .18, and
Region × Site, F(9.7, 184.2) = 2.0, p < .04, η2 = .10. Decomposition of the Congruency ×
Region interaction used Bonferroni corrected t tests to compare task congruency within each
of the five regions. Results indicated significantly longer P3 latencies for incongruent trials at
the central (M = 541.7 ms, SE = 13.5 ms) and centro-parietal (M = 526.9 ms, SE = 12.5 ms)
regions relative to congruent trials (central: M = 497.4 ms, SE = 12.1 ms; centro-parietal: M
= 492.6, SE = 12.2 ms), t(1, 19) > 3.0, p < .01. Decomposition of the Region × Site interaction
compared sites within each region and yielded significant Site effects at the frontal and fronto-
central regions, F(5.4, 103.1) > 2.5, p < .03, η2 = .12. Given that this interaction is peripheral
to the focus of the paper, and the number of t tests (i.e., 36) required to compare nine sites
against one another matched with the stringent Bonferroni-corrected criterion value (p < .0014),
Site effects for the frontal and fronto-central region are simply characterized by shorter P3
latency at medial relative to lateral sites.
Discussion
Overall, the findings revealed that a single, acute bout of moderately-intense aerobic exercise
facilitated children’s cognitive performance and influenced ERP components elicited in a task

requiring cognitive control. Specifically, following acute exercise, children exhibited increases
in response accuracy and P3 amplitude during incongruent trials. Acute exercise also benefited
performance on an academic achievement test of reading. Accordingly, these data indicate that
acute exercise might serve as a cost-effective means for improving specific aspects of academic
achievement and enhancing cognitive control during preadolescent childhood.
Task Performance
Flanker task performance replicated the robust finding of prolonged RT and decreased response
accuracy during incongruent relative to congruent trials (Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974); an effect
that has been observed in preadolescent children (Bunge et al., 2002; Hillman et al., 2009;
Mezzacappa, 2004) and adult populations (Kramer et al., 1999; Hillman et al., 2006) alike.
Novel to this report are the effects of acute exercise on preadolescent children’s task
performance. Results indicated general improvements in response accuracy following exercise
relative to rest, with selectively better performance during incongruent trials requiring greater
amounts of inhibition. Despite a significant trend for congruent trials, the effect of acute
exercise was not quite robust enough during this task condition requiring lesser amounts of
inhibitory control. Secondary analyses of the interference effect, which examine the cost of
conflict engendered by the presence of incongruent flanker stimuli, indicated significantly
better accuracy following acute exercise relative to rest. The absolute means for this
comparison indicated that task performance improved by almost 5% (d = .5), suggesting that
an acute bout of exercise served to enhance the cognitive control of attention through the
capability to manage conflict in the visual environment.
RT data indicated that an acute bout of exercise was ineffective in modulating the speed of
preadolescent children’s responses. This finding does not stand alone, as prior work with young
adults (Hillman et al., 2003) also found no differences in flanker RT following acute exercise.
Previous studies focused on the same relationship using other stimulus discrimination tasks
have also reported that RT latency appears insensitive to the effects of acute exercise (Grego
et al., 2004; Kamijo et al., 2004; Magnié et al., 2000). Regardless, response accuracy may be
a more informative measure in this population, given that previous reports have suggested that
preadolescent children respond more impulsively than adults with less modulation of their RT
(Davidson et al., 2006). As such, the improvements in task performance indicate that acute
exercise may be a viable treatment for enhancing cognitive control of inhibition in
preadolescent children.
Event-Related Brain Potentials
The neuroelectric changes underlying children’s goal-directed behaviors may provide insight
into specific component processes involved in the information processing stream that are
influenced by acute aerobic exercise participation. That is, ERPs, and the P3 potential in
particular, have been useful in elucidating exercise-induced changes in processes occurring
between stimulus engagement and response execution. The present findings contribute to the
understanding of this relationship in that the amplitude of the P3 potential increased following
exercise relative to rest. Specifically, increases in P3 amplitude were observed following
exercise, replicating previous reports with young adults (Hillman et al., 2003). However, a
more fine-grain analysis revealed a general amplitude increase in the fronto-central, central,
and parietal regions. At the central-parietal region, where maximal P3 amplitude was achieved,
a more selective effect was noted, with increased amplitude observed following exercise only
for incongruent trials; the trials requiring the most cognitive control. Similar to the response
accuracy findings described above, only a trend for congruent trials was observed.
Examination of the P3 topography from a coronal scalp perspective yielded similar findings.
Greater exercise-induced P3 amplitude was observed at electrodes overlying the left lateral

and medial sites, the midline sites, and the right medial sites. No such modulation was observed
over right lateral sites. Additionally, selective increases in P3 amplitude for incongruent trials
following exercise were observed at left medial sites, with only a trend noted for congruent
trials. Accordingly, similar to the response accuracy findings, acute exercise appears to
generally enhance P3 amplitude across the majority of the scalp recording sites, with selective
effects at the left medial electrodes overlying the central-parietal region. This finding stands
in contrast to specific congruency effects, which exhibited increased amplitude for incongruent
trials at midline and right medial electrodes overlying the frontal region.
The observation of a general exercise-induced enhancement in cognitive function with
selectively larger effects for task components requiring greater amounts of cognitive control
observed herein corroborates prior acute findings in adults (Hillman et al., 2003). For instance,
Hillman et al. (2003) observed shorter P3 latency following acute exercise only during
incongruent flanker trials. However, to the best of our knowledge the current data are the first
to demonstrate this relationship in preadolescent children, providing support for the tenant that
acute exercise may serve as a viable treatment for enhancing cognitive function in this
population. Given that P3 amplitude is thought to reflect the allocation of attentional resources
towards a particular aspect of the stimulus environment (Polich, 2007), and the flanker task
has been found to activate the frontal-parietal attentional network (Colcombe et al., 2004), the
topography of the exercise-induced P3 modulation appears well-situated. That is, despite the
fact that the P3 is believed to be the result of a neural network involving multiple regions
(Polich, 2007), it has been repeatedly found to achieve its maxima over the parietal scalp region.
Further, neuroimaging findings have revealed increased activation of the superior parietal
lobule with higher fitness in older adults (Colcombe et al., 2004), indicating that this particular
region appears amenable to exercise intervention. The current results support and extend these
prior neuroimaging findings and suggest that preadolescent populations may also derive
benefits to the attentional networks underlying cognitive control during inhibitory tasks.
It should be noted that the observed P3 findings are intriguing given that they were observed
approximately 25 minutes after the cessation of exercise. Prior work (Hillman et al., 2003) has
found similar effects of acute exercise on P3 in young adults 48 minutes after the completion
of exercise. These findings raise questions regarding the durability of acute exercise effects on
neuroelectric and task performance indices of inhibitory control. Clearly, one avenue for future
research is to further characterize the duration of the potential benefits of acute exercise on
neurocognitive function.
Academic Achievement Test Performance
The application of exercise-induced effects on brain and cognition is of interest to maximizing
cognitive health and function during development. Gaining an understanding of this
relationship during tasks that are directly relevant to scholastic performance is crucial toward
providing efficacious recommendations for interventions with a focus on enacting public policy
and current practice aimed at improving academic standards. The current findings provide a
beginning point with which to understand the real-world implications of providing physical
activity opportunities during the school day. Specifically, results indicated better reading
achievement following acute-exercise, while spelling and mathematics achievement were
unaffected. Normative data provided by Wilkinson (1993) suggests that acute exercise might
provide meaningful differences in test performance with the observed improvements being
indicative of a full grade level increase in reading achievement.
Surprising however, was the lack of exercise-related findings in arithmetic given the
computational nature of problem solving requiring the increased recruitment of cognitive
control. It is possible that acute exercise, or the dose provided herein, was not sufficient to
enhance this aspect of cognition. It is also possible that the beneficial influence of the acute

exercise bout subsided by the time this subtest was administered. That is, the WRAT was
administered in a fixed order; such that the reading subtest was administered first, followed by
the spelling and arithmetic subtests, respectively. Despite that the means for the three subtests
are in the hypothesized direction, only reading was robust enough to yield significance. Such
a finding is supported by the observed effect sizes (Reading: d = .59, Spelling: d = .16,
Arithmetic: d = .06) and future research should consider administering the WRAT closer to
the cessation of the acute exercise bout to better determine the relationship to all subject matters.
Alternatively, prior research has observed chronic physical activity and increases in aerobic
fitness relate to better performance on mathematical achievement (Castelli et al., 2007; Coe et
al., 2006), suggesting that the instrument used to measure this aspect of achievement may not
be sensitive enough to detect the subtle improvement conferred by acute exercise. Still other
research has indicated an equivocal relation between exercise and performance on mathematics
tasks (see Trudeau and Shephard, 2008 for review).
It should be noted that this experiment did not assess differences in participation motivation
for exercise or academics. It is possible that this factor may also play a role in the relationship
between acute exercise and cognition. Future research will need to investigate these factors
further to better understand the utility of acute exercise in enhancing scholastic performance.
Lastly, a variety of mechanisms have been posited to account for the underlying changes in
cognition following acute bouts of exercise. Non-human animal studies have observed positive
associations between aerobic exercise and biochemicals known to increase neuronal
proliferation and survival (e.g., brain derived neurotrophic factor, insulin like growth factor 1,
serotonin; Brezun & Daszuta, 2000; Russo-Neustadt, Ha, Ramirez, & Kesslak, 2001; van
Praag, Kempermann, & Gage, 1999; Vaynman & Gomez-Pinilla, 2005). Other studies suggest
that increases in cerebral blood flow may underlie exercise-induced changes in the brain (Delp,
et al., 2001; but see Querido & Sheel, 2007 for review), which in turn alter cognitive function.
Acute exercise has been found to increase cerebral blood flow due to increases in brain
metabolism, which alters the regulation of oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose, and lactate to
neural tissue (Dempsey, Hanson, and Henderson, 1984; Jorgensen et al., 2000). Lastly, others
have proposed a more general arousal mechanism whereby acute bouts of exercise arouse the
organism in a general fashion leading to changes in cognitive function (Magnié et al., 2000;
Kamijo et al., 2004; but see Polich and Kok, 1995 for review). Clearly, future research will
need to address these potential mechanisms to better determine the underlying causes of acute
exercise-induced changes in cognition.
The development of interventions toward improving school-based performance has become a
recent priority. One recent approach, which has proven successful, has been through the
implementation of cognitive control training. Diamond and her colleagues (2007)
demonstrated the importance of curricula in the development of cognitive control using a
randomized control design that randomly assigned teachers and preschool children to a
curriculum aimed at either enhancing executive functions or at balanced literacy. Their results
indicated improvements in performance in 4–5 year old students assigned to the executive
control intervention. Importantly, the tasks involved in the executive control intervention were
highly correlated with standardized academic achievement measures (Diamond et al., 2007).
Given the capability to develop and deliver cognitive control intervention to preadolescent
children in school, as well as the relationship of acute exercise to cognitive control described
herein, it seems promising that effective acute exercise interventions may be developed in
schools, perhaps in conjunction with cognitive control training, to promote enhanced academic
achievement in school age children.
