Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2) transcription factor regulates oxidative/xenobiotic stress
response
and
also
represses
inﬂammation.
However,
the
mechanisms
how
Nrf2
alleviates inﬂammation are still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Nrf2 interferes with
lipopolysaccharide-induced
transcriptional
upregulation
of
proinﬂammatory
cytokines,
including IL-6 and IL-1b. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and ChIP-qPCR analyses
revealed that Nrf2 binds to the proximity of these genes in macrophages and inhibits RNA Pol
II recruitment. Further, we found that Nrf2-mediated inhibition is independent of the
Nrf2-binding motif and reactive oxygen species level. Murine inﬂammatory models further
demonstrated that Nrf2 interferes with IL6 induction and inﬂammatory phenotypes in vivo.
Thus, contrary to the widely accepted view that Nrf2 suppresses inﬂammation through
redox control, we demonstrate here that Nrf2 opposes transcriptional upregulation
of
proinﬂammatory
cytokine
genes.
This
study
identiﬁes
Nrf2
as
the
upstream
regulator of cytokine production and establishes a molecular basis for an Nrf2-mediated
anti-inﬂammation approach.

ontrolling inﬂammation is critical in preventing various
diseases, such as allergies, autoimmune diseases, cancer
and metabolic syndromes1,2. Transcription factor Nrf2,
which is essential for protection against oxidative/xenobiotic
stresses, has been known to attenuate inﬂammation3,4. An
Nrf2-deﬁciency causes an exacerbation of inﬂammation in a
variety
of
murine
models,
such
as
sepsis,
pleurisy
and
emphysema5–8, and also causes autoimmune phenotypes in
some murine strains9,10. Consistently, Nrf2 activation in myeloid
cells alleviates inﬂammation11. In human clinical studies, NRF2
inducer Tecﬁdera (dimethyl fumarate) has been approved for
the treatment of multiple sclerosis12,13, in part based on its
anti-inﬂammatory function. These observations indicate that
Nrf2 is essential for the control of inﬂammation.
The regulatory system of Nrf2 activity has turned out as an
attractive drug target due to its sophisticated mechanism14,15.
Under unstressed conditions, Nrf2 is constitutively degraded
through binding to Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1),
an adapter protein of E3 ubiquitin ligase. In the presence of
oxidative and xenobiotic stresses, Nrf2 degradation is stalled,
leading to a rapid accumulation of Nrf2. Nrf2 then translocates
into the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with one of the small
Maf proteins. Nrf2 binds to the regulatory regions of target genes
to upregulate their transcription. Notably, a number of small
molecules have been found to disrupt the Keap1-mediated
degradation of Nrf2 and cause Nrf2 accumulation, and some
of these molecules are approved or being developed for
Nrf2-inducing therapy.
However, the mechanism underlying Nrf2-mediated anti-
inﬂammation has not been clariﬁed in detail. Since Nrf2
upregulates numerous antioxidant genes, elimination of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) has been considered to be the molecular
basis of Nrf2-mediated anti-inﬂammation. Indeed, recent reports
suggest that elimination of ROS suppresses inﬂammation in
Nrf2-deﬁcient mice8,16. On the other hand, Nrf2 regulates the
expression of macrophage-speciﬁc genes that are not categorized
as anti-oxidative stress-response genes. For example, genes
encoding MARCO, a scavenger receptor required for bacteria
phagocytosis17, and CD36, a receptor for oxidized low-density
lipoprotein related to atherosclerosis, are targets of Nrf2 (ref. 18).
These insights imply that Nrf2 may also act as an anti-
inﬂammatory regulator in a ROS-independent manner.
To address this issue, in this study we explored the Nrf2 target
genes in the inﬂammatory state using proinﬂammatory (M1-)
activated and anti-inﬂammatory (M2-) activated macrophages19.
Microarray and Nrf2 Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) -
seq analyses revealed that Nrf2 binds to the proximity of the
proinﬂammatory cytokine genes, including IL6 and IL1b, and
inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of these
genes. This Nrf2-mediated transcriptional interference appears
independent of ROS levels and independent of ARE (antioxidant
responsive
element).
Notably,
Nrf2
activation
signiﬁcantly
disrupted the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to the
IL6 and IL1b loci. In vivo imaging analysis further revealed that
Nrf2 activation inhibits IL6 induction in murine inﬂammation
model and alleviates inﬂammatory phenotypes. Thus, contrary
to the current hypothesis that Nrf2 represses inﬂammation
as a secondary consequence of anti-oxidation, these results
unequivocally demonstrate that Nrf2 inhibits the induction of
proinﬂammatory cytokine gene transcription. These ﬁndings
indicate that Nrf2 is the key regulator for the two important
cytoprotective pathways, anti-inﬂammation and anti-oxidation.
Results
Nrf2 inhibits proinﬂammatory cytokine gene expression. We
ﬁrst generated Nrf2-activated and Nrf2-depleted macrophages
through conditional knockout of the Keap1 gene in myeloid cells
(KpCKO) and general knockout of the Nrf2 gene (Nrf2-KO),
respectively. The KpCKO mice were generated by crossing
Keap1ﬂox/ﬂox mice and LysM-Cre mice20,21. In KpCKO and
Nrf2-KO mice, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)
were differentiated normally (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), and
comparable amounts of BMDMs were harvested from both lines
of mice (Supplementary Fig. 1c), indicating that Nrf2 activation
or
Nrf2-depletion
does
not
affect
the
differentiation
and
maturation of BMDMs. The number of neutrophils was also
comparable among these genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 1d).
In
KpCKO
mouse-derived
BMDMs,
Nrf2
accumulated
signiﬁcantly (Fig. 1a). This accumulation of Nrf2 induced the
expression of Nqo1 (NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1), a
representative Nrf2 target gene. The extent of Nqo1 induction was
similar in control BMDMs, LPS/interferon (IFN) g-treated
M1-BMDMs, and IL-4-treated M2-BMDMs (Fig. 1b), indicating
that accumulated Nrf2 functions equivalently in these BMDMs
regardless of the polarization towards M1 and M2 macrophages.
Microarray analyses revealed that the expression of 4,162 and
856 genes was upregulated by the M1 and M2 stimulation,
respectively. Expression proﬁles of these genes showed a strong
correlation between KpCKO and wild-type (WT) BMDMs
(Fig. 1c), indicating that the genetic Nrf2 activation does not
affect the polarization of macrophages. Surprisingly, upregulation
of a subset of M1-induced genes (561 genes) was speciﬁcally
inhibited in KpCKO BMDMs (Fig. 1d, blue bar). These genes
included IL6, IL1b, IL1a, Nos2 and IL12b. The inhibition was
conﬁrmed by real-time quantitative PCR analyses (Fig. 1e–i). In
contrast, expression levels of other M1-induced genes, such as Tnf
and Irf1, and M2-induced genes, such as Arg1 and Ccl17, were not
changed in KpCKO BMDMs (Fig. 1j–m). These results indicate
that Nrf2 inhibits the transcriptional induction of a subset of
M1-induced genes.
Nrf2 binds to the proximity of proinﬂammatory genes. To
examine whether Nrf2 directly binds to the M1-induced genes,
we performed Nrf2 ChIP-seq analysis. In the M1-induced gene
loci, Nrf2 binding was observed in the upstream regions of the
IL6 and IL1b genes (Fig. 2a,b). Nrf2 binding was also detected
in the downstream region of the IL1a gene (Fig. 2c), but this
Nrf2-binding peak was far away from the IL1a gene TSS
(transcription start site), so that the site may not be involved in
the IL1a gene regulation. The expression of Ckap2l gene, located
between the IL1a gene and the Nrf2 peak, was not changed upon
both Nrf2 activation and M1 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
Notably, Nrf2-binding peaks near the IL6 and IL1b genes were
not observed in our previous Nrf2 ChIP-seq analysis with Hepa1
cells22 (Fig. 2a,b). This is in clear contrast to the Nrf2 binding
near representative anti-oxidative Nrf2 target gene loci, Nqo1
(Fig. 2d) and Hmox1 (Supplementary Fig. 2b), in which Nrf2
binding was observed both in BMDMs and Hepa1 cells. In the
Nrf2 peaks, ARE (TGAG/CnnnGC)23,24 was enriched in their
peak summits, consistent with the previous Nrf2 ChIP-seq
study22 (Fig. 2e). When we examined phylogenetic conservation
of ARE sequences, we found that the consensus motif is
conserved among various mammalian genomes at the Nrf2
peak summit proximal to the IL6 gene (Fig. 2f). On the other
hand, Nrf2-binding regions proximal to IL1b and IL1a genes did
not contain conserved TGAG/CnnnGC motif at the peak
summits. Therefore, we surmise that Nrf2 is recruited through
the association with other proteins rather than direct binding to
the TGAG/CnnnGC motif or ARE, at least at the IL1b and IL1a
loci. The ARE localized in the proximity of IL6 gene has been
reported to upregulate IL6 expression in hepatocytes25, suggesting

that Nrf2 binds to the IL6 gene also in hepatic cells, but
activates gene expression, in contrast to the repression in
macrophages.
Binding of Nrf2 was further conﬁrmed by ChIP-qPCR analyses
of BMDMs derived from KpCKO mice (Fig. 2g–j). In the peak
regions proximal to the IL6, IL1b, IL1a and Nqo1 genes, the
Nrf2-binding signal was higher than the negative control loci, that
is, Thromboxane synthase gene (Txs) intron and the non-peak
regions proximal to the IL1b and IL1a genes (Fig. 2g–j). Nrf2
binding to proinﬂammatory cytokine loci was observed in both
untreated and M1-activated cells, although the most prominent
was observed in M1-stimulated BMDMs at the IL6 and IL1a loci.
Nrf2 negatively regulates a subset of M1-induced genes. We
then conducted an association analysis of the microarray data and
ChIP-seq data of M1-induced macrophage genes. The results
indicate that of the 561 genes repressed by Nrf2, 203 genes had
Nrf2-binding peaks in their proximal regions (Fig. 1d). We also
conducted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathway analysis26 for these 203 genes and found that several
important pathways were associated with these genes (Fig. 3a).
The pathways related to the inﬂammatory diseases were enriched
in these genes, supporting the notion that Nrf2 contributes to the
resolution of inﬂammation. These 203 genes displayed expression
proﬁles distinct from those of typical Nrf2 target genes, as the
Nrf2 activation in KpCKO mice strongly repressed the expression
of these 203 genes. Importantly, 132 out of these 203 Nrf2-
repressed genes harboured macrophage-speciﬁc Nrf2-binding
peaks in their proximal regions, as was the cases for the IL6, IL1b
and IL1a genes (Fig. 3b). In contrast, some of the 203 genes
retained Nrf2-binding peaks both in M1-macrophage and Hepa1
cells (Fig. 3b, blue dots). Collectively, these results imply that
Nrf2 directly inhibits the M1-induced expression of various
inﬂammation-related genes through binding to their proximal
regulatory regions.
Nrf2-dependent inhibition of proinﬂammatory gene expression.
To ascertain Nrf2 dependency of the inhibition of proin-
ﬂammatory cytokine gene induction, we tested the consequences
of chemical induction of Nrf2. For the pharmacological activation
of Nrf2, we used two small molecule inducers: diethylm-
aleate (DEM), an electrophilic reagent, and 15-deoxy-D12,14-
prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), an endogenous electrophilic lipid
that is naturally generated in macrophages5. These inducers
accumulated Nrf2 (Fig. 4a) and signiﬁcantly upregulated the
Nqo1 expression in an Nrf2-dependent manner (Fig. 4b).
Showing a stark contrast, treatment with the inducers markedly
inhibited the transcriptional induction of IL6, IL1b and IL1a in
M1-induced macrophages (Fig. 4c–e), as was the case for the
genetic activation of Nrf2 in KpCKO. The inhibition was
cancelled in Nrf2-KO BMDMs (Fig. 4c–e), indicating direct
contribution of Nrf2. DEM inhibited the IL6, IL1b and IL1a gene
expression dose-dependently (Fig. 4f–h).
We then examined Nrf2 binding to the proximity of the IL6,
IL1b and IL1a genes upon DEM treatment. The ChIP-qPCR
results clearly indicated that Nrf2 binds to the proximity of these
inﬂammatory cytokine genes (Fig. 4i–k) and also to the Nqo1
gene (Fig. 4l) in the DEM-treated BMDMs, even without LPS

treatment. Notably, the DEM treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited the
LPS-induced and LPS/alum-induced secretion of IL-6 (Fig. 4m)
and IL-1b (Fig. 4n) into the culture media, respectively. These
results clearly demonstrate that Nrf2 binds to the regulatory
regions of these inﬂammatory cytokine genes and reduces these
cytokine productions.
We then examined whether this negative regulation of the
inﬂammatory cytokine genes by Nrf2 is also operative in human
macrophage-related cells. To this end, we exploited human
monocytic THP-1 cells27. Showing very good agreement with
the results in mice, NRF2 activation by DEM inhibited the
LPS-induced transcriptions of the IL6, IL1B and IL1A genes,
but activated the NQO1 gene expression in the THP-1 cells
(Fig. 4o–r). These results indicate that the Nrf2-mediated
inhibition
of
proinﬂammatory
cytokine
gene
induction
is
conserved in human monocytic cells. Thus, consistent with
the results of the genetic analyses, the pharmacological induction
of
Nrf2
also
markedly
inhibited
the
transcription
of
proinﬂammatory cytokine genes both in murine and human cells.
Nrf2-mediated inhibition is independent of redox control.
Since
Nrf2
regulates
expression
of
numerous
genes
that
participate in the control of ROS, we examined whether the
Nrf2-mediated inhibition of proinﬂammatory cytokine gene
induction depends on the ROS levels. For this purpose, we treated
BMDMs with antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a precursor of
glutathione. LPS treatment signiﬁcantly upregulated the ROS
levels, while both of DEM- and NAC-treatment reduced ROS to
the basal level (Fig. 5a). However, the NAC-treatment did not
affect the LPS-induced transcription of the IL6, IL1b and IL1a
genes (Fig. 5b–d), strongly supporting our contention that
decrease of the ROS level does not provoke the inhibition of
proinﬂammatory cytokine genes.
To gain further insights into the relation of anti-inﬂammation
and activation of Nrf2, we next examined the temporal order of
inhibition and activation of Nrf2 target genes. After the M1
stimulation, the expression of IL6, IL1b and IL1a mRNAs was
quickly induced, as early as 3 h after the stimulation (Fig. 5e–g).
Of
note,
simultaneous
treatment
with
the
Nrf2
inducer
DEM almost completely suppressed the proinﬂammatory gene
induction from the early time-points (Fig. 5e–g). This immediate
suppression
occurred
almost
at
the
same
timing
as
the
DEM-mediated induction of the Nrf2 target genes, that is,
Nqo1 (Fig. 5h), Hmox1 and Gclc (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). These
results indicate that the transcriptional inhibition is a primary
event provoked by Nrf2, rather than a secondary consequence of
the elimination of ROS through the production of antioxidant
enzymes and proteins.
To clarify whether this Nrf2-mediated inhibition depends
on the order of LPS treatment and Nrf2 activation by DEM,
we changed the timing of the LPS and DEM additions. In an
experiment shown in Supplementary Fig. 4a, macrophages were
ﬁrst treated with DEM for 3 h and then treated with LPS for an
additional 3 h, while in an experiment shown in Supplementary
Fig. 4b, the order was switched. The results clearly showed that
DEM inhibited the proinﬂammatory cytokine gene expression
regardless of the order of LPS and DEM treatment.
Nrf2 inhibits recruitment of RNA polymerase II. In contrast to

through ROS elimination, our results thus far suggest that Nrf2
regulates the inﬂammation through transcriptional inhibition
of proinﬂammatory cytokine IL6 and IL1b genes. To determine
mechanisms how Nrf2 inhibits the induction of a subset of
inﬂammatory cytokine genes, we examined changes that Nrf2
elicits in the transcription of these genes. We ﬁrst conducted
ChIP-qPCR analyses exploiting BMDMs and a Pol II-speciﬁc
antibody to dissect the transcription initiation step. The results
revealed that LPS-induced binding of Pol II to the proximity of
TSSs of the IL6 and IL1b genes was signiﬁcantly inhibited by
concomitant DEM treatment (Fig. 6a,b), indicating that Nrf2
inhibits the transcriptional initiation of these proinﬂammatory
cytokine genes through the interference with Pol II recruitment to
the TSSs.
Since expression of many cytokine genes are regulated at
the post-transcriptional level28, we also examined stability of
the cytokine mRNAs. However, the Nrf2 activation did not
affect substantially the mRNA stability of IL6, IL1b and IL1a
(Supplementary Fig. 5a). We also assessed pre-mRNA syntheses
from the IL6, IL1b and IL1a genes and found that Nrf2 inhibited
the pre-mRNA syntheses, and that the magnitudes of the
inhibition were practically equivalent to those of the mature
mRNA reduction (Supplementary Fig. 5b). These results thus
indicate that Nrf2 regulates IL6 and IL1b gene expression at the
transcription initiation step.
It has been postulated that Pol II is recruited to the TSSs of
inﬂammation-related genes through association with a group
of inﬂammation-responding transcription factors19, and Nrf2
activation has been reported to inhibit NF-kB signal11. In our
survey of various ChIP-seq data, we found that transcription
factors required for inﬂammation-induced expression of IL6
gene, p65 (NF-kB) (ref. 29), C/EBPb (ref. 30) and c-Jun (AP-1)
(ref. 31), bind in close proximity of Nrf2-binding sites (Fig. 6a
and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Therefore, we hypothesized that
Nrf2 might inhibit the recruitment of these transcription factors.
We tested this hypothesis by conducting ChIP-qPCR analyses
exploiting BMDMs and p65-speciﬁc antibody and found that LPS
markedly enhanced the recruitment of p65 to the proximity of
the IL6 and IL1b genes. However, the recruitment of p65 was
unchanged by the DEM treatment, indicating that NF-kB was
recruited normally to the IL6 and IL1b gene regulatory regions
even under the Nrf2 activation (Fig. 6c). Similarly, recruitment
of C/EBPb was also unchanged upon the Nrf2 activation
(Supplementary Fig. 6b).
Furthermore, while LPS treatment provoked certain expected
changes in the histone modiﬁcations, including decrease in

complex33, MED16 and MED24 (Supplementary Fig. 7) in the
presence of DEM. These co-activator associations did not
decrease, or rather increased, in the LPS-treated cells compared
with LPS-untreated cells. Our results thus demonstrate that
Nrf2 inhibits the transcription initiation and Pol II recruitment
to the IL6 and IL1b TSSs without changing the recruitment
of
proinﬂammatory
transcription
factors.
Changes
in
the
co-activators and the histone modiﬁcations wait for further
extensive and elaborate analyses.
Nrf2-mediated inhibition is Nrf2 binding motif-independent.
To further delineate the mechanisms how Nrf2 operates the
inhibition of proinﬂammatory cytokine gene induction, we next
conducted a luciferase reporter assay using an B1 kb region
upstream of the IL6 gene that includes ARE. In IL6-wt construct,
upstream sequence of the IL6 gene was ligated to a luciferase
expression vector, while in IL6-mARE construct, ARE motif in
the region was mutated (Fig. 7a). Co-transfection of constitutive
active form of NRF2 (NRF2T80R) in 293T cells moderately
upregulated the luciferase reporter expression from IL6-wt, but
not from IL6-mARE (Fig. 7b), indicating that Nrf2 functions as a
transcriptional activator even at the IL6 locus. This result is
consistent with the previous report using hepatoma cells25. In
contrast, co-transfection of p65 markedly elevated the luciferase
reporter expression, indicating that NF-kB acts as the primary
inducer of the IL6 gene. Importantly, NRF2T80R inhibited the
reporter expression in a dose dependent manner and this
inhibition was observed even in the absence of ARE (Fig. 7c).
These results suggest that Nrf2 inhibits the IL6 gene expression
by interfering with the p65-mediated transcriptional activation of
the gene. Given that inﬂammation-responding transcription
factors bind to the close proximity of Nrf2-binding region
(Fig. 6a,c and Supplementary Fig. 6a,b), Nrf2 may interfere with
the function of these transcription factors, such as p65, and/or
co-factors required for inﬂammation-induced transcription.
To ascertain the ﬁnding that ARE might not be required for
the Nrf2-mediated inhibition of IL6 induction, we deleted the
Nrf2-binding regions including the ARE in macrophage-derived
Raw264.7 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 system (Supplementary
Fig. 8a,b). We analysed two clones, in which the centre region
of ChIP Nrf2-binding peak including the ARE was deleted. As the
proinﬂammatory transcription factor-binding sites are located
in the close proximity of the ARE, there is a possibility that
the deletion of this region may disrupt the recruitment of
transcription
factors
required
for
induction
of
IL6
gene
expression. Indeed this was the case and the deletion abolished
the LPS-induced expression of IL6 gene (Fig. 7d). Thus, our aim
to evaluate the ARE contribution to the Nrf2-mediated inhibition
cannot be accomplished.
In contrast, deletion of Nrf2-binding region proximal to the
IL1b gene kept the LPS-induction, perhaps due to preservation of
the binding sites of activating transcription factors (Fig. 7e).
Importantly,
the
DEM-mediated
induction
of
Nrf2
nicely
inhibited the LPS-mediated upregulation of IL1b gene expression,
and the deletion of Nrf2-binding region did not affect the
Nrf2-mediated inhibition of the IL1b induction, indicating that
Nrf2-binding region is not essential for the IL1b inhibition, as is
the case for ARE in the IL6 upstream region. One plausible
explanation for these observations is that Nrf2 may be recruited
to the IL6 and IL1b gene regulatory regions through the
association with other transcription factors or co-factors.
Nrf2 inhibits IL6 induction in murine inﬂammatory models.
Finally, we utilized the whole mount in vivo monitoring system
with hIL6-luc reporter (WIM-6) to verify the Nrf2-mediated
inhibition of IL6 gene induction in vivo (Fig. 8a). WIM-6 mice
harbour ﬁreﬂy luciferase transgenes, which is homologously
recombined to the human IL6 gene in a bacterial artiﬁcial
chromosome vector34. Thus, WIM-6 mice emit luminescence
under the IL6-inducing stimuli. In this study, we executed
an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model
known as a murine model of multiple sclerosis, because IL-6 has
been shown to be responsible for EAE development35. After
immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, WIM-6
mice on the C57BL/6 background exhibited intense IL6-luc
luminescence
in
their
brains
and
spinal
cords
due
to
autoimmunity against the myelin component (Fig. 8b, left).

Time course of the increase in luminescence showed a maximum
emission of luminescence after day 10 (Fig. 8c), simultaneously
with an increase in the EAE score (Fig. 8d).
In contrast, when we activated Nrf2 in WIM-6 mice through
concomitant knockdown of Keap1 (Keap1-KD), the IL6-luc
luminescence upon EAE induction was remarkably reduced
(Fig. 8b, right) throughout the experimental period (Fig. 8c). The
maximum IL6-luc luminescence in the observation period was
lower in Keap1-KD::WIM-6 mice than in WT Keap1::WIM-6
mice, although a few Keap1-KD mice showed the increase of
IL6-luc luminescence. The EAE clinical score was also reduced in
Keap1-KD::WIM-6 mice (Fig. 8d). The maximum EAE score in
the observation period was signiﬁcantly reduced in Keap1-
KD::WIM-6 mice compared with WT Keap1::WIM-6 mice
(Fig. 8d, right). We also conducted similar analyses exploiting
WIM-6 mice on the ICR/CD1 background, which were preferable
for in vivo imaging due to their white fur coat, but they were
low responders to EAE. Showing very good agreement with the
results of C57BL/6 mice, Keap1-KD::WIM-6 mice on the
ICR/CD1 background exhibited lower IL6-luc luminescence
(Supplementary Fig. 9a–c) and EAE score (Supplementary
Fig. 9d,e) than WT Keap1::WIM-6 mice did.
To further conﬁrm the Nrf2-medited inhibition of IL6 gene
induction in vivo, we utilized another inﬂammation model, that
is, Staphylococcus aureus infection. Upon infection with S. aureus,
WIM-6 mice with Nrf2 knockout showed much more intense
IL6-luc luminescence on their back than the WIM-6 mice with
normal Nrf2 expression showed (Supplementary Fig. 10a,b).
This experiment was executed by using the WIM-6 mice on the
ICR/CD1 background. These results clearly indicate that Nrf2
inhibits the IL6 expression and alleviates inﬂammatory symptoms
in vivo.
Discussion
While contributions of Nrf2 to anti-inﬂammation have been
recognized, molecular basis of the Nrf2 function has long
been obscure. In this study, two important points have been
clariﬁed. First, we discovered that Nrf2 inhibits the LPS-induced
expression of proinﬂammatory cytokine genes, including IL6 and
IL1b, through the ROS-independent transcriptional inhibition.
We believe that this ﬁnding will be a turning point in
understanding the Nrf2 function related to inﬂammation, because
we previously assumed that Nrf2 function was limited to
IL6 expression

oxidative stress control and that anti-inﬂammation was merely a
consequence of ROS elimination. In contrast to this dogma, this
study clearly unravels that Nrf2 is the key regulator of
proinﬂammatory cytokine expression as well as intracellular
ROS, as summarized in Fig. 8e. Second, while Nrf2 has been
recognized as an activating transcription factor, our data clarify
the presence of transcription-inhibiting function of Nrf2. The
binding of Nrf2 in close proximity of the IL6 and IL1b genes
implies that Nrf2 inhibits transcription through direct DNA
binding. However, our analyses indicate that Nrf2-mediated

inhibition of the inﬂammatory cytokine gene expression in M1
macrophages is ARE-independent. Furthermore, Nrf2 inhibits
Pol II recruitment to the TSSs of the IL6 and IL1b genes without
affecting the NF-kB recruitment required for the expression of
IL6 and IL1b genes. Although precise elucidation of the molecular
basis how Nrf2 elicits the transcriptional inhibition is rather
complicated and still needs to be elucidated, our present ﬁndings
support the notion that the Nrf2 regulates negatively the target
genes that encode inﬂammatory cytokines.
Mechanisms how Nrf2 inhibits the transcription of inﬂamma-
tory cytokine genes in M1 macrophages is intriguing. However, in
contrast to the rich history of research on the transcriptional
activation by Nrf2, the transcriptional inhibition by Nrf2 in
proinﬂammatory macrophages is an emerging concept that are
introduced in this study, so that elucidation of ﬁne mechanisms
for the Nrf2-mediated inhibition of transcription needs further
studies. In this regard, it should be noted that results from
luciferase reporter assay imply that whereas Nrf2 acts as a
transcriptional activator at various loci, Nrf2 speciﬁcally inhibits
the inﬂammation-induced transcription mediated by NF-kB.
Of note, our results suggest that Nrf2 interferes with the
transcription-activating
system
optimized
for
inﬂammatory
response. This notion coincides with the fact that Nrf2 binds to
the IL6 and IL1b loci, but does not affect the binding of NF-kB
and C/EBPb to the loci, in our ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR
analyses.
The binding machinery of Nrf2 to the IL6 and IL1b loci is an
important part in the mechanism of Nrf2-mediated transcrip-
tional inhibition. In contrast to the situation that Nrf2 directly
binds to a number of detoxifying and antioxidant target genes
through ARE and activates expression of these genes, IL6 gene
appears to be regulated in an ARE-independent manner, and
AREs near the IL1b gene are phylogenetically not conserved.
In contrast, our results demonstrate that Nrf2 inhibits the
NF-kB-mediated transcription of these proinﬂammatory cytokine
genes. Since the Nrf2-binding regions near the IL6 and IL1b
genes correspond to the common binding regions of multiple
proinﬂammatory transcription factors, such as p65, C/EBPb and
c-Jun, it seems likely that Nrf2 is recruited to this region through
association with other factors. Although direct interaction of Nrf2
with these inﬂammatory transcription factors has not been
reported, MafK, one of the obligatory partner molecules of Nrf2,
is reported to associate with p65 (ref. 36). Consistent with the
report,
we
observed
that
p65
resides
in
the
Nrf2-based
transcription factor complex in LPS-treated Raw264.7 cells
(H.S. and H.M., unpublished observation).
Our data further demonstrate that Nrf2 associates with
co-activators, such as CBP and the component of Mediator
complex,
MED16
and
MED24,
even
in
the
LPS-treated
conditions32,33. Thus, available lines of evidence suggest that in
an inﬂammatory condition, Nrf2 is recruited to regulatory
regions
of
proinﬂammatory
cytokine
genes
in
an
ARE-
independent
manner
and
inhibits
their
transcription
by
interfering with the activity of proinﬂammatory transcription
factors without losing CBP and mediators. Alternative possibility
is that Nrf2 suppresses the transcription of proinﬂammatory
cytokine genes indirectly by recruiting transcriptional repressors
acting in trans to the transcription factor complex formed in the
proximity of the inﬂammatory cytokine genes.
We surmise that our current ﬁndings may account for the
mechanisms in drug efﬁcacy of the Nrf2 inducer Tecﬁdera, which
is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis12,13, because IL-6
and IL-1 are the key players in the development of multiple
sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases. Loss-of-function model
mice of IL-6 or IL-1 receptor are resistant to EAE, a murine
model of multiple sclerosis35,37. It has been demonstrated
that
Nrf2
activation
by
treatment
with
small
molecule
inducers, CDDO (2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic
acid) derivatives and sulforaphane alleviates the EAE clinical
score, while Nrf2-deﬁciency leads to increased susceptibility
to EAE38–40. CDDO-treated EAE mice showed a signiﬁcant
reduction in Th1 and Th17 cytokines including IL-6 (ref. 38),
implying that Nrf2 activation with small molecules alleviates EAE
through the inhibition of IL6 gene expression. Our results
strongly support the contention that the therapeutic effect of the
Nrf2 inducer depends, at least in part, on the Nrf2-mediated
inhibition of IL-6 and IL-1 induction. Of note, Nrf2-deﬁciency
has been found to cause spontaneous autoimmune phenotypes in
certain strains of mice9,10, raising the possibility that Nrf2
inducers are applicable for the other autoimmune diseases.
We surmise that some of the Nrf2 functions previously
attributed to ROS elimination may depend on the repression of
IL-6 and IL-1. One of the candidates for this is anti-tumour
immunity. It has been shown that Nrf2 acts as a ‘double-edged
sword’ in tumour development. Nrf2 inhibits carcinogenesis
through ROS elimination and detoxiﬁcation41. In contrast,
Nrf2 stimulates tumour proliferation through anti-oxidation
and metabolic reprogramming of the cells42. In this regard,
we recently reported that Nrf2 supports anti-tumour immunity
by reducing the ROS level in myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSCs), resulting in reduced tumour metastasis43,44.
Interestingly, a blockade of IL-6 secreted from MDSCs has been
reported to support the anti-tumour immunity45. Thus, Nrf2
contributes to the anti-tumour immunity through dual pathways,
the repression of IL-6/IL-1 and/or ROS elimination in MDSCs.
Another candidate for the Nrf2 function downstream of the
IL-6/IL-1 repression is diabetes prevention. We have reported
that genetic Nrf2 activation by Keap1-knockdown suppress
obesity-induced diabetes through the improvement of insulin
secretion and insulin resistance, resulting in the prevention of
hyperglycemia46. Of note, the blockade of an IL-1 signal with an
IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra (Kineret) improves glycaemia

genes, including IL6 and IL1b, and inhibits their transcription. At the same time Nrf2 upregulates expression of genes coding antioxidant proteins. These
antioxidant proteins eliminate ROS and subsequently contribute to the anti-inﬂammation.

and insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes47.
Nrf2 activation provokes the alteration of diabetes-related gene
expression, which includes anti-oxidation, energy consumption
and glyconeogenesis46. It seems plausible that in addition to
these genes, Nrf2-mediated inhibition of IL-6/IL-1 induction
contributes to the prevention and improvement of diabetes.
As IL-6/IL-1 signalling exacerbates a broad spectrum of
diseases, an Nrf2 inducer could be beneﬁcial in the treatment
of these IL-6/IL-1-related diseases. Neutralizing antibodies and
receptor antagonists for blocking IL-6/IL-1 signalling have been
developed and approved, for instance, for rheumatoid arthritis
and other inﬂammatory diseases. Efforts are underway to ﬁnd
new indications, such as diabetes and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease1,2,48. Whereas these antibody-based drugs
need to be administered subcutaneously or intravenously, one of
the advantages of the small molecule Nrf2 inducers is that they
can be administered orally, lowering the burden on patients.
Therefore, it should be noted that our present study has ﬁrmly
established the concept that Nrf2 inducers retain the potential to
act as alternative anti-inﬂammatory agents.
Methods
Experimental animals. Deletion of the ﬂoxed Keap1 gene in myeloid lineage cells
was achieved by crossing Keap1 ﬂox mice20 with heterozygous mice harbouring a
Cre recombinase transgene under the regulation of the lysozyme M (LysM) locus21.
WT, Nrf2  /  (Nrf2-KO) (ref. 3) and Keap1ﬂox/ﬂox::LysM-Cre (KpCKO) mice
were maintained in a C57BL6/J genetic background. WIM-6 (ref. 34), Nrf2-KO and
Keap1-knockdown mice (Keap1ﬂox/ﬂox)49 were maintained in C57BL6/J and ICR
background. Results were similar in both sexes. Mice were used for experiments at
8–15 weeks of age, with the exception of neutrophil count that was performed with
mice o1 year old. All mice were treated according to the regulations of The
Standards for Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Tohoku University
(Sendai, Japan) and the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments of
the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan. All
animal experiments were executed with the approval of the Tohoku University
Animal Care Committee.
BMDMs and cell cultures. To obtain BMDMs, hemolyzed bone marrow cells
from WT, Nrf2  /  (Nrf2-KO) and Keap1ﬂox/ﬂox::LysM-Cre (KpCKO) mice were
cultured for 7 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (fetal bovine
serum), 20-ng ml  1 M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulation factor, PeproTech)
and Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Life Technologies). At day 3, a half volume of fresh
DMEM with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 20-ng ml  1 M-CSF was added. At day 7,
BMDMs were depleted with M-CSF several hours before stimulation. Unless stated,
data are presented as the mean±s.d. of three mice, and the signiﬁcance was
determined by Student’s unpaired t-test. THP-1 cells were obtained from the
Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank, and maintained in RPMI 1640
containing 10% (vol/vol) FBS. Data from THP-1 cells are presented as the
mean±s.d. of three individual samplings, and the signiﬁcance was determined
by Student’s unpaired t-test.
Reagents and stimulation. Cells were left untreated (Con) or incubated with
5-ng ml  1 LPS and 10-ng ml  1 IFNg (M1), 10-ng ml  1 IL-4 (M2), or 5-ng ml  1
LPS (LPS). LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
and IFNg and IL-4 were from R&D Systems. For pharmacological Nrf2 activation,
cells were treated with 100-mM diethylmaleate (DEM) or 15-deoxy-D12,14-pros-
taglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). These Nrf2 inducers were stored as the solutions dissolved
in DMSO (vehicle). DEM was from Wako chemicals, and 15d-PGJ2 was from
Sigma-Aldrich. For detection of ROS, BMDMs were treated with CellROX Deep
red reagent (Thermo) during the last 30 min of 4 h stimulation with or without
5-ng ml  1 LPS concomitant treatment with 100-mM DEM or 1-mM NAC. Cell-
ROX signal was detected with ﬂow cytometry analysis using FACS-Caliber
(BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (TOMY Digital Biology). For the evaluation
of the mRNA stability, 5-mg ml  1 actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to
cell cultures pre-treated with LPS for 3 h without removal of the LPS-containing
media. Unless stated, cells were stimulated for 6 h in microarray and qRT-PCR
analyses, and for 4 h in ChIP-seq, ChIP-qPCR and immunoblot analyses.
Immunoblot analysis. Whole cells were lysed in a SDS-containing sampling buffer
and subjected to immunoblot analysis using Nrf2-speciﬁc antibody50 (clone 103,
1:200 dilution) and a-Tubulin-speciﬁc (Sigma-Aldrich; T9026, 1:5,000 dilution)
antibodies. Immunoblot using a-Tubulin-speciﬁc antibody is used as a loading
control. Images have been cropped for presentation. Full-size images are presented
in Supplementary Fig. 11.
Microarray analysis. Total RNA samples of BMDMs from two independent mice
of each genotype were extracted using an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) and used for
the microarray analyses. The expression data were normalized using GeneSpring
software (Silicon Genetics), and analysed using an R/bioconductor (ver. 3.0.2,
R Core Team (2014). R: A language and environment for statistical computing.
R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL http://www.
R-project.org/). Pathway analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes26.
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from cells using
ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA
using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies). Real-time quan-
titative PCR was performed with an ABI PRISM 7300 sequence detector system
and StepOne Plus (Applied Biosystems) using THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix
(TOYOBO). Data were normalized by the Gapdh mRNA level. Primer sequences
are available on request.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq). BMDMs
were ﬁxed with 1% (wt/vol) formaldehyde and subsequently quenched with
glycine. After washing with PBS, the ﬁxed samples were suspended in cell lysis
buffer (5-mM PIPES-KCl pH8.0, 85-mM KCl, 0.5% (vol/vol) NP40), and collected
nuclei were stored at  80 C as nuclear pellets or nuclear lysates dissolved in
nuclei lysis buffer (50-mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 10-mM EDTA, 1% (wt/vol) SDS). For
Nrf2 ChIP, lysates were thawed and sonicated with Soniﬁer (BRANSON) to obtain
chromatin fragments of 300–1,000 bp, and 10-fold-diluted with ChIP dilution
buffer (16.7-mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 1.2-mM EDTA, 0.01% (wt/vol) SDS, 1.1%
(vol/vol) TrironX100, 167-mM NaCl). For Pol II, p65, C/EBPb, H3K27me3,
H3K27Ac and H3K4me3 ChIP, nuclear pellets were thawed and suspended in
buffer NUC (15-mM Hepes pH 7.5, 60-mM KCl, 15-mM NaCl, 0.32-mM sucrose,
3-mM CaCl2) and digested with MNase (New England Biolabs). After doubling-
dilution with a sonication buffer (90-mM Hepes pH 7.9, 220-mM NaCl, 10-mM
EDTA, 1% (vol/vol) NP-40, 0.2% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% (wt/vol)
SDS), nuclei were homogenized with a Bioruptor (Tosho denki). After washing,
a complex of nuclear proteins/DNAs and antibodies against Nrf2 (Cell Signaling
technology; D1Z9C; 1:250 dilution), Pol II (Santa Cruz; sc-9001; 1:24 dilution),
p65 (Cell Signaling technology; D14E12; 1:120 dilution), C/EBPb (Santa Cruz;
sc-150; 1:24 dilution), H3K27me3 (Cosmo Bio; MABI0323; 1:240 dilution),
H3K27Ac (Cosmo Bio; MABI0309; 1:240 dilution) and H3K4me3 (Cosmo Bio;
MABI0004; 1:240 dilutions) was retrieved with Protein A- and Protein
G-Dynabeads (Life Technologies). After the cross-linking was reversed, chromatin
fragments were treated with RNase A and proteinase K. DNA was puriﬁed
with phenol-chloroform extraction or Ampure XP (Beckman Coulter). In the
ChIP-qPCR analyses, the values from the immunoprecipitated samples were
normalized to that from the input DNA. Primer sequences are available on request.
ChIP-seq libraries were prepared from B1 ng each of ChIP and input samples
using the Ovation Ultralow DR Multiplex System 1–8 (NuGEN, 0330-32). Libraries
were clonally ampliﬁed in a ﬂow cell and sequenced with Illumina Hiseq 2500
(Illumina) to generate paired-end sequences. BMDMs from two independent mice
were used for the ChIP-seq, and the sum of sequenced reads from two samples was
subjected to following analyses. Sequenced reads were mapped to the mouse
genome51 (mm9) with bwa52 (ver. 0.6.2-r126). Paired reads uniquely mapped to
the genome were extracted using samtools53 (ver. 0.1.18). The peaks were called
using a model-based analysis of ChIP-seq (macs54, ver. 2.1.0) using Po0.0005 as a
threshold. The Nrf2 ChIP-seq data of Hepa1 cells obtained in a previous study were
re-peak called in the same manner. Peaks were annotated with BEDtools55 and a
ChIPpeakAnno package56 (ver. 2.10.0). For the de novo motif discovery, the
sequences of the  25-bp to þ 25-bp region from peak summits were analysed
with a rGADEM package (ver. 2.0.10, Arnaud Droit, Raphael Gottardo, Gordon
Robertson and Leiping Li (2014). rGADEM: de novo motif discovery).
ELISA. BMDMs were incubated with 5-ng ml  1 LPS and 100-mg ml  1 alum
(Thermo Scientiﬁc; Imject Alum Adjuvant) with or without DEM for 24 h. The
concentration of IL-6 and IL-1b in the culture medium was measured using an
ELISA kit (R&D Systems), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Luciferase reporter assay. Approximately 1 kb upstream region of the IL6 gene
TSS containing the WT ARE (GCTGAGTCA) or mutated ARE (AGATCTGAC)
was conjugated to the translation start site of the NanoLuc gene in the pNL2.2
vector (Promega). 293T cells (2.0  103 cells per well) were plated in 96-well plates
24 h before transfection. The NanoLuc reporter vectors were co-transfected with
pQC-FLAG-hNRF2T80R plasmid33 and pcDNA3-p65 plasmid using Lipofectamin
3000 Reagent (Thermo) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 h of the
transfection, the luminescence was quantiﬁed and normalized using Nano-Glo
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega).
Immunoprecipitation of Nrf2 complex in Raw264.7 cells. Raw264.7 cells
were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Right before the
treatment with DEM and LPS, the medium was changed to low-glucose-DMEM

supplemented with 10% FBS. An amount of 100-mM of DEM with or without 20-
ng ml  1 LPS were added to the medium, and the cells were harvested after 4 h. The
cells were washed with PBS and crosslinked with 0.5-mM DTME and 0.5-mM
DSP, which were quenched by 5-mM cysteine after 30 min. The crosslinked cells
were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the supernatant was collected and used for
immunoprecipitation with 5-mg antibody speciﬁc for Nrf2 (Cell Signaling
Technology; D1Z9C-XP) per sample. Precipitated samples together with input
samples were analysed by immunoblot analysis, for which anti-Nrf2 (ref. 50)
(1:100), anti-CBP (Santa Cruz; sc-1211, 1:2,000), anti-MED16 (Abcam; ab130996,
1:5,000) and anti-MED24 (Bethyl lab; A301-472A, 1:2,000) antibodies were used.
Deletion of Nrf2-binding regions with CRISPR/Cas9 system. The expression
vector to express the guide RNA and Cas9 was produced using px330 plasmid.
Raw264.7 cells were co-transduced with two types of px330 (ref. 57) those express
guide RNAs speciﬁc for upstream and downstream regions of Nrf2-binding region,
and selected with puromycin.
In vivo inﬂammatory models and IL6-luc imaging analyses. Mice were
subcutaneously administered with 150-mg myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
35–55 peptide (AnaSpec) and complete Freund’s adjuvant (Difco) containing
0.8-mg Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the abdomen. To support penetration of the
blood–brain barrier, 200-ng pertussis toxin was intraperitoneally administered on
days 0 and 2. EAE clinical signs were scored as follows: 0, normal; 1, limp tail or
hind limb weakness; 2, both of limp tail and hind limb weakness; 3, partial hind
limb paralysis; and 4, complete hind limb paralysis. In vivo IL6-luc luminescence
was measured with an IVIS SpectrumCT (PerkinElmer) after intraperitoneal
injection of luciferin (Promega). For quantiﬁcation, IL6-luc luminescence from the
ventral midline area of EAE-induced mice was measured with Living Image version
4.3. Mice on the C57BL/6 background were shaved on their back at the day before
imaging analysis. For the cutaneous S. aureus infection model, mice on the
ICR background were shaved on their back and inoculated intra-dermally with
mid-logarithmic growth phase S. aureus 834 strain (3  106 colony forming units)
in 100-ml of sterile PBS using a 27-gauge syringe. In vivo bioluminescence was
evaluated at 0, 2, 24 and 48 h after inoculation.
