Optimal database combinations for
literature searches in systematic reviews:
a prospective exploratory study
Wichor M. Bramer1*, Melissa L. Rethlefsen2, Jos Kleijnen3,4 and Oscar H. Franco5
Abstract
Background: Within systematic reviews, when searching for relevant references, it is advisable to use multiple
databases. However, searching databases is laborious and time-consuming, as syntax of search strategies are
database specific. We aimed to determine the optimal combination of databases needed to conduct efficient
searches in systematic reviews and whether the current practice in published reviews is appropriate. While previous
studies determined the coverage of databases, we analyzed the actual retrieval from the original searches for
systematic reviews.
Methods: Since May 2013, the first author prospectively recorded results from systematic review searches that he
performed at his institution. PubMed was used to identify systematic reviews published using our search strategy
results. For each published systematic review, we extracted the references of the included studies. Using the
prospectively recorded results and the studies included in the publications, we calculated recall, precision, and
number needed to read for single databases and databases in combination. We assessed the frequency at which
databases and combinations would achieve varying levels of recall (i.e., 95%). For a sample of 200 recently
published systematic reviews, we calculated how many had used enough databases to ensure 95% recall.
Results: A total of 58 published systematic reviews were included, totaling 1746 relevant references identified by
our database searches, while 84 included references had been retrieved by other search methods. Sixteen percent
of the included references (291 articles) were only found in a single database; Embase produced the most unique
references (n = 132). The combination of Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Google Scholar
performed best, achieving an overall recall of 98.3 and 100% recall in 72% of systematic reviews. We estimate that
60% of published systematic reviews do not retrieve 95% of all available relevant references as many fail to search
important databases. Other specialized databases, such as CINAHL or PsycINFO, add unique references to some
reviews where the topic of the review is related to the focus of the database.
Conclusions: Optimal searches in systematic reviews should search at least Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and
Google Scholar as a minimum requirement to guarantee adequate and efficient coverage.

Background
Investigators and information specialists searching for
relevant references for a systematic review (SR) are
generally advised to search multiple databases and to
use additional methods to be able to adequately identify
all literature related to the topic of interest [1–6]. The
Cochrane Handbook, for example, recommends the use
of at least MEDLINE and Cochrane Central and, when
available, Embase for identifying reports of randomized
controlled trials [7]. There are disadvantages to using
multiple databases. It is laborious for searchers to trans-
late a search strategy into multiple interfaces and search
syntaxes, as field codes and proximity operators differ
between
interfaces.
Differences
in
thesaurus
terms
between databases add another significant burden for
translation.
Furthermore,
it
is
time-consuming
for
reviewers who have to screen more, and likely irrelevant,
titles and abstracts. Lastly, access to databases is often
limited and only available on subscription basis.
Previous studies have investigated the added value of
different databases on different topics [8–15]. Some
concluded that searching only one database can be suffi-
cient as searching other databases has no effect on the
outcome [16, 17]. Nevertheless others have concluded
that a single database is not sufficient to retrieve all
references for systematic reviews [18, 19]. Most articles
on this topic draw their conclusions based on the
coverage of databases [14]. A recent paper tried to find
an acceptable number needed to read for adding an
additional database; sadly, however, no true conclusion
could be drawn [20]. However, whether an article is
present in a database may not translate to being found
by a search in that database. Because of this major limi-
tation, the question of which databases are necessary to
retrieve all relevant references for a systematic review
remains unanswered. Therefore, we research the prob-
ability that single or various combinations of databases
retrieve the most relevant references in a systematic
review by studying actual retrieval in various databases.
The aim of our research is to determine the combin-
ation of databases needed for systematic review searches
to provide efficient results (i.e., to minimize the burden
for the investigators without reducing the validity of the
research by missing relevant references). A secondary
aim is to investigate the current practice of databases
searched for published reviews. Are included references
being missed because the review authors failed to search
a certain database?
Methods
Development of search strategies
At Erasmus MC, search strategies for systematic reviews
are
often
designed
via
a
librarian-mediated
search
service. The information specialists of Erasmus MC
developed an efficient method that helps them perform
searches in many databases in a much shorter time than
other methods. This method of literature searching and
a pragmatic evaluation thereof are published in separate
journal articles [21, 22]. In short, the method consists of
an efficient way to combine thesaurus terms and title/
abstract terms into a single line search strategy. This
search is then optimized. Articles that are indexed with
a set of identified thesaurus terms, but do not contain
the current search terms in title or abstract, are screened
to discover potential new terms. New candidate terms
are added to the basic search and evaluated. Once opti-
mal recall is achieved, macros are used to translate the
search
syntaxes
between
databases,
though
manual
adaptation of the thesaurus terms is still necessary.
Review projects at Erasmus MC cover a wide range of
medical
topics,
from
therapeutic
effectiveness
and
diagnostic accuracy to ethics and public health. In
general, searches are developed in MEDLINE in Ovid
(Ovid MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed
Citations, Ovid MEDLINE® Daily and Ovid MEDLINE®,
from 1946); Embase.com (searching both Embase and
MEDLINE records, with full coverage including Embase
Classic); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL) via the Wiley Interface; Web of
Science
Core
Collection
(hereafter
called
Web
of
Science); PubMed restricting to records in the subset “as
supplied by publisher” to find references that not yet
indexed in MEDLINE (using the syntax publisher [sb]);
and Google Scholar. In general, we use the first 200
references as sorted in the relevance ranking of Google
Scholar. When the number of references from other
databases was low, we expected the total number of
potential relevant references to be low. In this case, the
number of hits from Google Scholar was limited to 100.
When the overall number of hits was low, we addition-
ally searched Scopus, and when appropriate for the
topic, we included CINAHL (EBSCOhost), PsycINFO
(Ovid), and SportDiscus (EBSCOhost) in our search.
Beginning in May 2013, the number of records
retrieved from each search for each database was
recorded at the moment of searching. The complete
results from all databases used for each of the systematic
reviews were imported into a unique EndNote library
upon search completion and saved without deduplica-
tion for this research. The researchers that requested the
search received a deduplicated EndNote file from which
they selected the references relevant for inclusion in
their systematic review. All searches in this study were
developed and executed by W.M.B.
Determining relevant references of published reviews
We searched PubMed in July 2016 for all reviews
published since 2014 where first authors were affiliated

to
Erasmus
MC,
Rotterdam,
the
Netherlands,
and
matched those with search registrations performed by
the medical library of Erasmus MC. This search was
used in earlier research [21]. Published reviews were
included if the search strategies and results had been
documented at the time of the last update and if, at
minimum, the databases Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane
CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar had
been used in the review. From the published journal
article, we extracted the list of final included references.
We documented the department of the first author. To
categorize the types of patient/population and interven-
tion, we identified broad MeSH terms relating to the most
important disease and intervention discussed in the
article. We copied from the MeSH tree the top MeSH
term directly below the disease category or, in to case of
the intervention, directly below the therapeutics MeSH
term. We selected the domain from a pre-defined set of
broad domains, including therapy, etiology, epidemiology,
diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Lastly, we checked
whether the reviews described limiting their included
references to a particular study design.
To identify whether our searches had found the
included references, and if so, from which database(s) that
citation was retrieved, each included reference was located
in the original corresponding EndNote library using the
first author name combined with the publication year as a
search term for each specific relevant publication. If this
resulted in extraneous results, the search was subse-
quently limited using a distinct part of the title or a
second author name. Based on the record numbers of the
search results in EndNote, we determined from which
database these references came. If an included reference
was not found in the EndNote file, we presumed the
authors used an alternative method of identifying the
reference (e.g., examining cited references, contacting
prominent authors, or searching gray literature), and we
did not include it in our analysis.
Data analysis
We determined the databases that contributed most to
the reviews by the number of unique references retrieved
by each database used in the reviews. Unique references
were included articles that had been found by only one
database search. Those databases that contributed the
most unique included references were then considered
candidate databases to determine the most optimal
combination of databases in the further analyses.
In Excel, we calculated the performance of each individ-
ual database and various combinations. Performance was
measured using recall, precision, and number needed to
read. See Table 1 for definitions of these measures. These
values were calculated both for all reviews combined and
per individual review.
Performance of a search can be expressed in different
ways. Depending on the goal of the search, different
measures may be optimized. In the case of a clinical
question, precision is most important, as a practicing
clinician does not have a lot of time to read through
many articles in a clinical setting. When searching for a
systematic review, recall is the most important aspect, as
the researcher does not want to miss any relevant refer-
ences. As our research is performed on systematic
reviews, the main performance measure is recall.
We identified all included references that were uniquely
identified by a single database. For the databases that
retrieved the most unique included references, we calcu-
lated the number of references retrieved (after deduplica-
tion) and the number of included references that had been
retrieved by all possible combinations of these databases,
in total and per review. For all individual reviews, we
determined the median recall, the minimum recall, and
the percentage of reviews for which each single database
or combination retrieved 100% recall.
For each review that we investigated, we determined
what the recall was for all possible different database
combinations of the most important databases. Based on
these, we determined the percentage of reviews where
that database combination had achieved 100% recall,
more than 95%, more than 90%, and more than 80%.
Based on the number of results per database both before
and after deduplication as recorded at the time of
searching, we calculated the ratio between the total
number of results and the number of results for each
database and combination.
Improvement of precision was calculated as the ratio
between the original precision from the searches in all data-
bases and the precision for each database and combination.
To compare our practice of database usage in systematic
reviews against current practice as evidenced in the litera-
ture, we analyzed a set of 200 recent systematic reviews
from PubMed. On 5 January 2017, we searched PubMed
for articles with the phrase “systematic review” in the title.
Starting with the most recent articles, we determined the
databases searched either from the abstract or from the
full text until we had data for 200 reviews. For the individ-
ual databases and combinations that were used in those
reviews, we multiplied the frequency of occurrence in that
set of 200 with the probability that the database or
combination would lead to an acceptable recall (which we
defined at 95%) that we had measured in our own data.

Results
Our earlier research had resulted in 206 systematic
reviews published between 2014 and July 2016, in which
the first author was affiliated with Erasmus MC [21]. In 73
of these, the searches and results had been documented
by the first author of this article at the time of the last
search. Of those, 15 could not be included in this research,
since they had not searched all databases we investigated
here. Therefore, for this research, a total of 58 systematic
reviews were analyzed. The references to these reviews
can be found in Additional file 1. An overview of the
broad topical categories covered in these reviews is given
in Table 2. Many of the reviews were initiated by members
of the departments of surgery and epidemiology. The re-
views covered a wide variety of disease, none of which was
present in more than 12% of the reviews. The interven-
tions were mostly from the chemicals and drugs category,
or surgical procedures. Over a third of the reviews were
therapeutic, while slightly under a quarter answered an
etiological question. Most reviews did not limit to certain
study designs, 9% limited to RCTs only, and another 9%
limited to other study types.
Together, these reviews included a total of 1830 refer-
ences. Of these, 84 references (4.6%) had not been re-
trieved by our database searches and were not included
in our analysis, leaving in total 1746 references. In our
analyses, we combined the results from MEDLINE in
Ovid and PubMed (the subset as supplied by publisher)
into one database labeled MEDLINE.
Unique references per database
A total of 292 (17%) references were found by only one
database. Table 3 displays the number of unique results
retrieved for each single database. Embase retrieved the
most unique included references, followed by MEDLINE,
Web
of
Science,
and
Google
Scholar.
Cochrane
CENTRAL is absent from the table, as for the five reviews
limited to randomized trials, it did not add any unique
included references. Subject-specific databases such as
CINAHL, PsycINFO, and SportDiscus only retrieved
additional included references when the topic of the
review was directly related to their special content,
respectively nursing, psychiatry, and sports medicine.
Overall performance
The four databases that had retrieved the most unique ref-
erences (Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google
Scholar) were investigated individually and in all possible
combinations (see Table 4). Of the individual databases,
Embase had the highest overall recall (85.9%). Of the com-
binations of two databases, Embase and MEDLINE had
the best results (92.8%). Embase and MEDLINE combined
with either Google Scholar or Web of Science scored
similarly well on overall recall (95.9%). However, the com-
bination with Google Scholar had a higher precision and
higher median recall, a higher minimum recall, and a
higher proportion of reviews that retrieved all included
references. Using both Web of Science and Google
Scholar in addition to MEDLINE and Embase increased
the overall recall to 98.3%. The higher recall from adding
extra databases came at a cost in number needed to read
(NNR). Searching only Embase produced an NNR of 57
on average, whereas, for the optimal combination of four
databases, the NNR was 73.
Probability of appropriate recall
We calculated the recall for individual databases and
databases in all possible combination for all reviews
included in the research. Figure 1 shows the percentages
of reviews where a certain database combination led to a
certain recall. For example, in 48% of all systematic
reviews, the combination of Embase and MEDLINE

reaches a recall of at least 95%. In 72% of studied sys-
tematic reviews, the combination of Embase, MEDLINE,
Web of Science, and Google Scholar retrieved all
included references. In the top bar, we present the
results of the complete database searches relative to the
total number of included references. This shows that
many database searches missed relevant references.
Differences between domains of reviews
We analyzed whether the added value of Web of Science
and Google Scholar was dependent of the domain of the
review. For 55 reviews, we determined the domain. See
Fig. 2 for the comparison of the recall of Embase, MED-
LINE, and Cochrane CENTRAL per review for all
identified domains. For all but one domain, the traditional
combination
of
Embase,
MEDLINE,
and
Cochrane
CENTRAL did not retrieve enough included references.
For four out of five systematic reviews that limited to
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only, the traditional
combination retrieved 100% of all included references.
However, for one review of this domain, the recall was 82%.
Of the 11 references included in this review, one was found
only in Google Scholar and one only in Web of Science.
Reduction in number of results

found when searching all databases, including databases

searching a selection of databases. See Fig. 3 for the legend
of the plots in Figs. 4 and 5. Figure 4 shows the distribu-
tion of this value for individual reviews. The database
combinations with the highest recall did not reduce the
total number of results by large margins. Moreover, in
combinations where the number of results was greatly
reduced, the recall of included references was lower.
Improvement of precision
To determine how searching multiple databases affected
precision, we calculated for each combination the ratio
between the original precision, observed when all databases
were searched, and the precision calculated for different
database combinations. Figure 5 shows the improvement of
precision for 15 databases and database combinations.
Because precision is defined as the number of relevant
references divided by the number of total results, we see a
strong correlation with the total number of results.
Status of current practice of database selection
From a set of 200 recent SRs identified via PubMed, we
analyzed the databases that had been searched. Almost

all reviews (97%) reported a search in MEDLINE. Other
databases that we identified as essential for good recall
were
searched
much
less
frequently;
Embase
was
searched in 61% and Web of Science in 35%, and Google
Scholar was only used in 10% of all reviews. For all indi-
vidual databases or combinations of the four important
databases from our research (MEDLINE, Embase, Web
of Science, and Google Scholar), we multiplied the
frequency of occurrence of that combination in the ran-
dom set, with the probability we found in our research
that this combination would lead to an acceptable recall
of 95%. The calculation is shown in Table 5. For
example, around a third of the reviews (37%) relied on
the combination of MEDLINE and Embase. Based on
our findings, this combination achieves acceptable recall
about half the time (47%). This implies that 17% of the
reviews in the PubMed sample would have achieved an
acceptable recall of 95%. The sum of all these values is
the total probability of acceptable recall in the random
sample. Based on these calculations, we estimate that
the probability that this random set of reviews retrieved
more than 95% of all possible included references was
40%. Using similar calculations, also shown in Table 5,
we estimated the probability that 100% of relevant
references were retrieved is 23%.
Discussion
Our study shows that, to reach maximum recall, searches
in systematic reviews ought to include a combination of
databases. To ensure adequate performance in searches
(i.e., recall, precision, and number needed to read), we find
that literature searches for a systematic review should, at
minimum, be performed in the combination of the follow-
ing four databases: Embase, MEDLINE (including Epub
ahead of print), Web of Science Core Collection, and
Google Scholar. Using that combination, 93% of the
systematic reviews in our study obtained levels of recall
that could be considered acceptable (> 95%). Unique
results from specialized databases that closely match
systematic review topics, such as PsycINFO for reviews in
the fields of behavioral sciences and mental health or
CINAHL for reviews on the topics of nursing or allied
health, indicate that specialized databases should be used
additionally when appropriate.
We find that Embase is critical for acceptable recall in
a review and should always be searched for medically
oriented systematic reviews. However, Embase is only
accessible via a paid subscription, which generally makes
it challenging for review teams not affiliated with
academic medical centers to access. The highest scoring
database combination without Embase is a combination

of MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, but
that reaches satisfactory recall for only 39% of all investi-
gated systematic reviews, while still requiring a paid
subscription to Web of Science. Of the five reviews that
included only RCTs, four reached 100% recall if MEDLINE,
Web of Science, and Google Scholar combined were
complemented with Cochrane CENTRAL.

Handbook
recommends
searching
MEDLINE,
Cochrane
CENTRAL,
and
Embase
for
systematic reviews of RCTs. For reviews in our study
that included RCTs only, indeed, this recommendation
was sufficient for four (80%) of the reviews. The one
review where it was insufficient was about alternative
medicine, specifically meditation and relaxation therapy,
where one of the missed studies was published in the
Indian Journal of Positive Psychology. The other study

LILACS and SciELO in our reviews, they did not provide
unique references in our study. Subject-specific databases

like PsycINFO only added unique references to a small
percentage of systematic reviews when they had been used
for the search. The third key database we identified in this
research, Web of Science, is only mentioned as a citation
index in the Cochrane Handbook, not as a bibliographic
database. To our surprise, Cochrane CENTRAL did not
identify any unique included studies that had not been
retrieved by the other databases, not even for the five
reviews focusing entirely on RCTs. If Erasmus MC
authors had conducted more reviews that included
only RCTs, Cochrane CENTRAL might have added
more unique references.
MEDLINE did find unique references that had not
been found in Embase, although our searches in Embase
included all MEDLINE records. It is likely caused by dif-
ference in thesaurus terms that were added, but further
analysis would be required to determine reasons for not
finding the MEDLINE records in Embase. Although
Embase covers MEDLINE, it apparently does not index
every article from MEDLINE. Thirty-seven references
were found in MEDLINE (Ovid) but were not available
in Embase.com. These are mostly unique PubMed refer-
ences, which are not assigned MeSH terms, and are
often freely available via PubMed Central.
Google Scholar adds relevant articles not found in the
other databases, possibly because it indexes the full text
of all articles. It therefore finds articles in which the
topic of research is not mentioned in title, abstract, or
thesaurus terms, but where the concepts are only
discussed in the full text. Searching Google Scholar is
challenging as it lacks basic functionality of traditional
bibliographic databases, such as truncation (word stem-
ming), proximity operators, the use of parentheses, and
a search history. Additionally, search strategies are
limited to a maximum of 256 characters, which means
that creating a thorough search strategy can be laborious.
Whether Embase and Web of Science can be replaced
by Scopus remains uncertain. We have not yet gathered
enough data to be able to make a full comparison
between Embase and Scopus. In 23 reviews included in
this research, Scopus was searched. In 12 reviews (52%),
Scopus
retrieved
100%
of
all
included
references
retrieved by Embase or Web of Science. In the other
48%, the recall by Scopus was suboptimal, in one
occasion as low as 38%.
Of all reviews in which we searched CINAHL and
PsycINFO, respectively, for 6 and 9% of the reviews,
unique
references
were
found.
For
CINAHL
and
PsycINFO, in one case each, unique relevant references
were found. In both these reviews, the topic was highly
related to the topic of the database. Although we did not
use these special topic databases in all of our reviews,
given the low number of reviews where these databases
added relevant references, and observing the special
topics of those reviews, we suggest that these subject
databases will only add value if the topic is related to the
topic of the database.
Many articles written on this topic have calculated
overall recall of several reviews, instead of the effects on
all individual reviews. Researchers planning a systematic
review generally perform one review, and they need to
estimate the probability that they may miss relevant arti-
cles in their search. When looking at the overall recall,
the combination of Embase and MEDLINE and either
Google Scholar or Web of Science could be regarded
sufficient with 96% recall. This number however is not
an answer to the question of a researcher performing a
systematic review, regarding which databases should be
searched. A researcher wants to be able to estimate the
chances that his or her current project will miss a rele-
vant reference. However, when looking at individual
reviews, the probability of missing more than 5% of
included references found through database searching is
33% when Google Scholar is used together with Embase
and MEDLINE and 30% for the Web of Science,
Embase, and MEDLINE combination. What is consid-
ered acceptable recall for systematic review searches is
open for debate and can differ between individuals and
groups. Some reviewers might accept a potential loss of
5% of relevant references; others would want to pursue
100% recall, no matter what cost. Using the results in
this research, review teams can decide, based on their
idea of acceptable recall and the desired probability
which databases to include in their searches.
Strengths and limitations
We did not investigate whether the loss of certain refer-
ences had resulted in changes to the conclusion of the
reviews. Of course, the loss of a minor non-randomized
included study that follows the systematic review’s con-
clusions would not be as problematic as losing a major
included randomized controlled trial with contradictory
results. However, the wide range of scope, topic, and
criteria between systematic reviews and their related
review types make it very hard to answer this question.
We found that two databases previously not recom-
mended as essential for systematic review searching,
Web of Science and Google Scholar, were key to
improving recall in the reviews we investigated. Because
this is a novel finding, we cannot conclude whether it is
due to our dataset or to a generalizable principle. It is
likely that topical differences in systematic reviews may
impact whether databases such as Web of Science and
Google Scholar add value to the review. One explanation
for our finding may be that if the research question is
very specific, the topic of research might not always be
mentioned in the title and/or abstract. In that case,
Google Scholar might add value by searching the full

----- Page 10 (native) -----
text of articles. If the research question is more interdis-
ciplinary, a broader science database such as Web of
Science is likely to add value. The topics of the reviews
studied here may simply have fallen into those categor-
ies, though the diversity of the included reviews may
point to a more universal applicability.
Although
we
searched
PubMed
as
supplied
by
publisher separately from MEDLINE in Ovid, we com-
bined the included references of these databases into
one measurement in our analysis. Until 2016, the most
complete MEDLINE selection in Ovid still lacked the
electronic publications that were already available in
PubMed. These could be retrieved by searching PubMed
with the subset as supplied by publisher. Since the intro-
duction of the more complete MEDLINE collection
Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed
Citations, and Ovid MEDLINE®, the need to separately
search PubMed as supplied by publisher has disap-
peared. According to our data, PubMed’s “as supplied by
publisher”
subset
retrieved
12
unique
included
references, and it was the most important addition in
terms of relevant references to the four major databases.
It is therefore important to search MEDLINE including
the “Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process, and Other Non-
Indexed Citations” references.
These results may not be generalizable to other studies
for other reasons. The skills and experience of the
searcher are one of the most important aspects in the ef-
fectiveness of systematic review search strategies [23–25].
The searcher in the case of all 58 systematic reviews is an
experienced biomedical information specialist. Though we
suspect that searchers who are not information specialists
or librarians would have a higher possibility of less well-
constructed searches and searches with lower recall, even
highly trained searchers differ in their approaches to
searching. For this study, we searched to achieve as high a
recall as possible, though our search strategies, like any
other search strategy, still missed some relevant references
because relevant terms had not been used in the search.
We are not implying that a combined search of the four
recommended databases will never result in relevant refer-
ences being missed, rather that failure to search any one
of these four databases will likely lead to relevant refer-
ences being missed. Our experience in this study shows
that additional efforts, such as hand searching, reference
checking, and contacting key players, should be made to
retrieve extra possible includes.
Based on our calculations made by looking at random
systematic reviews in PubMed, we estimate that 60% of
these reviews are likely to have missed more than 5% of
relevant references only because of the combinations of
databases that were used. That is with the generous
assumption that the searches in those databases had
been designed sensitively enough. Even when taking into
account that many searchers consider the use of Scopus
as a replacement of Embase, plus taking into account
the large overlap of Scopus and Web of Science, this
estimate remains similar. Also, while the Scopus and
Web of Science assumptions we made might be true for
coverage, they are likely very different when looking at
recall, as Scopus does not allow the use of the full
features of a thesaurus. We see that reviewers rarely use
Web of Science and especially Google Scholar in their
searches, though they retrieve a great deal of unique
references in our reviews. Systematic review searchers
should consider using these databases if they are avail-
able to them, and if their institution lacks availability,
they should ask other institutes to cooperate on their
systematic review searches.
The major strength of our paper is that it is the first
large-scale study we know of to assess database perform-
ance for systematic reviews using prospectively collected
data. Prior research on database importance for system-
atic reviews has looked primarily at whether included
references could have theoretically been found in a
certain database, but most have been unable to ascertain
whether the researchers actually found the articles in
those databases [10, 12, 16, 17, 26]. Whether a reference
is available in a database is important, but whether the
article can be found in a precise search with reasonable
recall is not only impacted by the database’s coverage.
Our experience has shown us that it is also impacted by
the ability of the searcher, the accuracy of indexing of
the database, and the complexity of terminology in a
particular field. Because these studies based on retro-
spective analysis of database coverage do not account
for the searchers’ abilities, the actual findings from the
searches performed, and the indexing for particular arti-
cles, their conclusions lack immediate translatability into
practice.
This
research
goes
beyond
retrospectively
assessed coverage to investigate real search performance
in databases. Many of the articles reporting on previous
research concluded that one database was able to re-
trieve most included references. Halladay et al. [10] and
van Enst et al. [16] concluded that databases other than
MEDLINE/PubMed did not change the outcomes of the
review, while Rice et al. [17] found the added value of
other databases only for newer, non-indexed references.
In addition, Michaleff et al. [26] found that Cochrane CEN-
TRAL included 95% of all RCTs included in the reviews in-
vestigated. Our conclusion that Web of Science and Google
Scholar are needed for completeness has not been shared
by previous research. Most of the previous studies did not
include these two databases in their research.
Conclusions
We recommend that, regardless of their topic, searches
for
biomedical
systematic
reviews
should
combine
Bramer et al. Systematic Reviews  (2017) 6:245

Embase,
MEDLINE
(including
electronic
publications
ahead of print), Web of Science (Core Collection), and
Google Scholar (the 200 first relevant references) at mini-
mum. Special topics databases such as CINAHL and
PsycINFO should be added if the topic of the review
directly touches the primary focus of a specialized subject
database, like CINAHL for focus on nursing and allied
health or PsycINFO for behavioral sciences and mental
health. For reviews where RCTs are the desired study
design, Cochrane CENTRAL may be similarly useful.
Ignoring one or more of the databases that we identified as
the four key databases will result in more precise searches
with a lower number of results, but the researchers should
decide whether that is worth the >increased probability of
losing relevant references. This study also highlights once
more that searching databases alone is, nevertheless, not
enough to retrieve all relevant references.
Future research should continue to investigate recall
of actual searches beyond coverage of databases and
should consider focusing on the most optimal database
combinations, not on single databases.
