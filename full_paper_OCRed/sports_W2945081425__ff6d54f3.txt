ABSTRACT
Mental health symptoms and disorders are common 
among elite athletes, may have sport related 
manifestations within this population and impair 
performance. Mental health cannot be separated from 
physical health, as evidenced by mental health symptoms 
and disorders increasing the risk of physical injury and 
delaying subsequent recovery. There are no evidence 
or consensus based guidelines for diagnosis and 
management of mental health symptoms and disorders 
in elite athletes. Diagnosis must differentiate character 
traits particular to elite athletes from psychosocial 
maladaptations.
Management strategies should address all contributors 
to mental health symptoms and consider biopsychosocial 
factors relevant to athletes to maximise benefit 
and minimise harm. Management must involve 
both treatment of affected individual athletes and 
optimising environments in which all elite athletes 
train and compete. To advance a more standardised, 
evidence based approach to mental health symptoms 
and disorders in elite athletes, an International 
Olympic Committee Consensus Work Group critically 
evaluated the current state of science and provided 
recommendations.
Background
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) 
convened a consensus meeting on 12–14 November 
2018 in Lausanne, Switzerland, at which experts 
reviewed the scientific literature addressing mental 
health symptoms and disorders in elite athletes. 
The participants analysed the current best evidence 
to provide a consensus statement for clinical prac-
tice and individual and systemic interventions to 
improve mental health among elite athletes. We 
define elite athletes as those competing at profes-
sional, Olympic or collegiate levels. Collegiate 
athletes often train and compete at levels similar to 
professional athletes, and including them expands 
the research we can draw on for this paper.
The group was charged with the following tasks:
►
►
to review the literature describing prevalence, 
diagnosis and impact on athletic performance 
of mental health symptoms and disorders 
within elite athletes
►
►
to review the literature describing and estab-
lishing recommendations for non-pharmaco-
logical and pharmacological management of 
mental health symptoms and disorders in elite 
athletes
►
►
to provide recommendations on how to mini-
mise negative impacts of the sport environment 
on mental health symptoms and disorders in 
elite athletes.
This consensus paper fulfils the IOC charge 
by addressing the multifaceted aspects of mental 
health symptoms and disorders in elite athletes. The 
intended audience includes sport and exercise medi-
cine physicians and other clinicians (including phys-
iotherapists and athletic trainers), psychiatrists and 
other licensed mental health providers, other mental 
health and performance professionals who work with 
elite athletes, researchers in the fields of elite athlete 
mental health and clinical or institutional leaders/
administrators who are stakeholders in sport.
Methods
Planning for the consensus meeting began in June 
2017 (figure  1). The initial organising group 
included IOC leadership (RB and LE) and the 
meeting co-chairs (CLR and BH). They identified 
members of an expert panel, comprised of 23 indi-
viduals from 13 nations with expertise in the mental 
health of elite athletes. Panellists were identified 
based on their publications in the past 5 years, as 
determined by a literature search, and invited based 
on their clinical and/or scientific understanding of 
specific topics concerning mental health symptoms 
and disorders in elite athletes.
The meeting work group included the invited 
panel of experts, the organising committee 
members, four representatives from the IOC 
Medical and Scientific Department and two elite 
athlete representatives. Of the expert panel invited, 
one did not reply to the invitation and thus was not 
included, and one was removed after initial inclu-
sion due to lack of follow-up. The final work group 
included psychiatrists, psychologists, primary care 
and orthopaedic sports medicine physicians, exer-
cise scientists, a neurologist, a neurological surgeon 
and a social worker, and the work group repre-
sented Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Italy,

Consensus statement
Figure 1  International Olympic Committee (IOC) consensus process 
for literature review, meeting and publication.
The Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, 
the UK and the USA.
The following methods sections describe the steps taken to 
plan and prepare for the meeting, the conduct of the meeting 
and the writing of the consensus statement.
Systematic reviews
The organising group initially identified 20 topic areas for the 
consensus statement (Figure 1). For each, a lead author and 
sometimes secondary author(s) were identified based on their 
scientific and clinical expertise.
An experienced librarian conducted a systematic review of 
each topic area using the PubMed, SportDiscus, PSycINFO, 
Scopus and Cochrane databases, and any additional databases 
felt relevant by individual topic leaders, for each topic. Searches 
were limited to the English language, and all study designs were 
included. An initial search strategy was developed with input 
from the expert panel to ensure that all relevant search terms 
were captured. Searches were revised by the librarian as needed. 
The expert panel screened 14 689 published articles. Results and 
input from the expert panel led to revision of research ques-
tions asked within the 20 topic areas. Leaders of topics without 
a recent published systematic review were invited to write sepa-
rate, more detailed, subspecialty papers on their topics; these 
will be published separately.
Each topic team was asked to summarise the key informa-
tion from their review and share it with the expert panel before 
presenting it at the consensus meeting. A draft of these summa-
ries was circulated to all participants prior to the meeting.
Consensus meeting
The consensus meeting was a 2.5 day series of presentations 
in which topic leaders presented their systematic review find-
ings. Group discussion followed each presentation, and meeting 
co-chairs took notes during the discussions to capture all 
comments.
Writing the consensus statement
The initial draft systematic review summary document was edited 
based on agreement at the meeting. Key statements agreed on 
during the meeting were not changed during the drafting of the 
final document. To ensure inclusion of the most recent literature, 
the systematic literature reviews were re-conducted 3 months 
before submission of the manuscript, using the same search strat-
egies as initially used. The updated search results were provided 
to topic leaders, and additional edits made accordingly. The 
edited final document was circulated for review and further 
editing by the full expert panel.
General prevalence of mental health symptoms 
and disorders in elite athletes
Increasing numbers of epidemiological studies address mental 
health symptoms and disorders in elite athletes. Reporting prev-
alence compared with that in the general population is particu-
larly difficult for the following reasons: (a) most studies in elite 
athletes have lacked reference groups from the general popula-
tion; (b) different instruments have been used to assess mental 
health symptoms and disorders in athletes compared with the 
general population; (c) studies do not necessarily consider cross 
cultural differences in meanings and manifestations of mental 
health symptoms and disorders; and (d) studies vary in whether 
they describe self-reported specific mental health symptoms 
or physician diagnosed disorders. Regarding the latter, mental 
health disorders are typically defined as conditions causing 
clinically significant distress or impairment that meet certain 
diagnostic criteria, such as in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5)1 or the International 
Classification of Diseases,2 whereas mental health symptoms are 
more common, may be significant but do not occur in a pattern 
meeting specific diagnostic criteria and do not necessarily cause 
significant distress or functional impairment.
The reported prevalence of mental health symptoms and disor-
ders among male elite athletes from team sports (cricket, football, 
handball, ice hockey and rugby) varies from 5% for burnout and 
adverse alcohol use to nearly 45% for anxiety and depression.3–13 
Prospective studies have reported that mental health disorders 
occur in 5% to 35% of elite athletes over a follow-up period of up 
to 12 months.13–19 Among female elite athletes, mental health disor-
ders—especially eating disorders—are also prevalent.20–23 Among 
collegiate athletes, the prevalence of mental health disorders ranges 
from 10% to 25% for depression and eating disorders.24–30
During an elite sport career, generic and sport specific factors 
may combine to increase the risk of mental health symptoms and 
disorders.31 32 Elite athletes may experience a greater overall risk 
of mental health symptoms and disorders compared with their 
athletic counterparts if they suffer severe musculoskeletal injuries, 
undergo multiple surgeries, suffer from decreased sport perfor-
mance or tend toward maladaptive perfectionism.7 16 22 33–38 In 
other circumstances, sport participation might protect against 
mental health symptoms and disorders,39 since exercise has 
antidepressant effects.40 Finally, an athlete might have mental 
health symptoms or suffer with a mental health disorder with no 
apparent association between elite sport participation and the 
mental health condition.39
General approaches to management of mental 
health symptoms and disorders in elite athletes
Management of mental health symptoms and disorders in elite 
athletes should take a comprehensive, integrative approach

Consensus statement
Box 1  Guidelines to overcome common obstacles that 
can interfere with psychotherapy with elite athletes
►
►Clinicians should:
––
be flexible about timing of sessions (although without 
allowance of persistent cancelling of sessions)55
––
urge couples or family therapy when relational issues 
impact functioning or performance55
––
recommend psychotherapy plus pharmacological therapy 
when indicated for cases of moderate to severe mental 
health symptoms or disorders
––
obtain collateral information from close informants, with 
appropriate consent, for athletes with severe mental 
health symptoms or disorders55
––
insist that the athlete undergo substance use disorder 
treatment if needed55
►
►Clinicians should not:
––
agree to see a surrogate (such as a coach or trainer) for 
psychotherapy sessions55
––
provide experimental treatments, which may give false 
hope to athletes55
that puts the athlete at the centre and addresses the full range 
of emotional, mental, physical, social, spiritual and environ-
mental influences that may affect a person’s mental health. A 
personalised management strategy should be used to address 
mental health symptoms and disorders while striving to maintain 
optimum well being. The strategy should take into consideration 
the elite athlete’s particular needs and circumstances, utilise the 
most appropriate consensus or evidence based interventions 
from a variety of scientific disciplines, and recognise differences 
across countries and cultures.
A core challenge in developing this consensus statement was 
that the evidence comes predominantly from high income coun-
tries, which have more health services compared with low and 
middle income countries41–43 where many athletes reside. There 
is debate concerning the range of ways in which mental health 
symptoms and disorders can be managed in culturally appro-
priate ways, drawing on resources from other health sectors and 
community carers, for example,44–46 with increasing evidence 
that intervening in ways that support existing community 
strengths may be of benefit to people with these conditions.47 48 
It is important to consider this global context throughout this 
statement.
Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy is defined as the treatment of mental health 
symptoms or disorders or problems of living, and/or facilitation 
of personal growth, by psychological means; it is often based 
on therapeutic principles, structure and techniques. Psycho-
therapy, with or without pharmacologic therapy, is effective 
for the treatment of mental health symptoms and disorders but 
is commonly underprescribed.49 Moreover, studies on specific 
types of psychotherapy in elite athletes are lacking. Individual 
psychotherapy, especially cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), 
is efficacious for treating depression and anxiety disorders in the 
general population.50 In many situations, psychoeducation and/
or counselling (broadly defined) are considered the treatment of 
choice for athletes.51 Depending on the sport, the athlete and 
the family dynamics, family therapy may be helpful.52 Further, 
although substance use may be problematic in elite athletes, little 
research exists on different psychotherapeutic treatments for 
substance use disorders in this population.53 54
Compared with non-athletes, elite athletes may present with 
sport related issues that may pose a challenge in psychotherapy 
and make it more difficult to tailor therapeutic interventions. 
These issues can include the following: diagnostic challenges (eg, 
overtraining syndrome vs major depression); aggression; narcis-
sism; and entitlement.52 Insight oriented therapy, such as time 
limited psychodynamic psychotherapy, may be indicated for elite 
athletes with challenging personality and behavioural issues.55 
In these situations, therapy should first focus on maladaptive 
behaviour patterns because personality traits tend to be more 
resistant to change.55
When engaging elite athletes in the psychotherapeutic 
process, the clinician must be mindful of how the athlete’s char-
acteristics may impact treatment. For instance, elite athletes may 
anticipate receiving preferential treatment from their healthcare 
providers.55 While a degree of flexibility may be needed to main-
tain patient privacy and accommodate travel schedules, perpetu-
ating a pattern of preferential treatment may lead to unintended 
boundary violations.49 Box 1 guides clinicians as to how to over-
come common obstacles that can interfere with treatment in elite 
athletes.
Clinicians should not compromise on delivering other appro-
priate treatment, including medications and hospitalisation as 
necessary, during psychotherapy with elite athletes.55 While 
barriers exist that may prevent elite athletes from seeking, 
accepting or effectively using psychotherapy, elite athletes also 
possess skills and personality characteristics—notably discipline 
and compliance with recommended regimens—that make them 
especially good candidates for psychotherapeutic interventions.49
Pharmacological treatment
Although psychotherapy is generally regarded as the firstline 
treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms of mental 
illness,51 medications may be needed in those with more severe 
psychopathology.56 Box 2 outlines four important considerations 
particular to elite athletes when prescribing psychiatric medica-
tions. Common side effects that may negatively impact athletic 
performance include: sedation; weight gain; cardiac side effects 
(including orthostatic hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, 
palpitations, arrhythmias and electrocardiographic changes 
such as QTc prolongation); and tremor.56 57 Other relevant side 
effects include: impaired concentration; muscle rigidity; motor 
changes (including akathisia and bradykinesia); weight loss; 
blurred vision or dizziness; anxiety or agitation; and insomnia.56
The distinction between therapeutic and ergogenic perfor-
mance enhancement that may result from a medication is 
important for all classes of medication.58 For example, an athlete 
who is performing poorly because of uncontrolled anxiety may 
gain a therapeutic performance enhancing effect by taking sero-
tonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, there is no 
evidence that they provide ergogenic performance enhancement, 
and thus they are not prohibited substances in elite sport.57 59 60 
Indeed, stimulants are the only class of psychiatric drugs clas-
sified as prohibited substances, and they are prohibited only in 
competition; research suggest they could enhance performance 
beyond a pharmacological therapeutic effect.59
Finally, safety risks are paramount with certain psychiatric 
medications, as elite athletes commonly exercise at much higher 
intensity than the general population.61 For example, medica-
tions with blood levels that must be tightly regulated, such as

Consensus statement
Box 2  Four key considerations relevant for elite athletes 
when prescribing psychiatric medications57
►
►Potential negative impact on athletic performance

designed to treat)
►
►Potential non-therapeutic performance enhancement effects 
(ie, ergogenic effects)

►Potential safety risks
lithium, can be difficult to manage in elite athletes whose levels 
might be influenced by hydration status.56 57
The four considerations of prescribing medications to elite 
athletes listed in Box 2 may vary by the particular sport and its 
demands,56 level of performance required,56 time frame within 
the athletic training/competition cycle and anticipated duration 
of treatment. Ultimately, medication choices must be informed 
by the need to provide effective clinical care for mental health 
symptoms and disorders.56 Although there are athlete specific 
considerations within each category of psychiatric medications, 
there is a paucity of applicable research on the topic.56 60 Available 
studies have methodological flaws, including small sample sizes; 
medications are not used in real world dosages or time frames; 
populations studied are not representative of elite athletes; few 
female athletes are studied; performance measures used to deter-
mine if a medication has a negative impact on athletic perfor-
mance may not represent actual performance impact; and study 
subjects often lack the mental health disorder that the medica-
tion is intended to treat.60–62 We acknowledge these limitations. 
Nevertheless, some research is available regarding psychiatric 
prescribing for athletes, and details are shared as relevant below.

Sleep disorders and sleep concerns
Insufficient sleep is defined as less than 7 hours of sleep for a 
healthy adult;63–68 adolescents and younger adults need 9–10 
hours of sleep.67–70 National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) surveys indicate that over half of collegiate athletes in 
the USA report regularly getting insufficient sleep; 50% report 
less than 7 hours of sleep per night in season and 79% report 8 
hours or less.71 Data among large samples of elite athletes are 
sparse, although 49% of Olympic athletes would be classified 
as 'poor sleepers'4 (a term that includes multiple sleep prob-
lems). Elite athletes are particularly unlikely to get sufficient 
sleep the night prior to competition.72 Sleep deprivation impairs 
athletic performance across many sports73–96 and sleep improve-
ment leads to improved performance.78 83 97–100 Sufficient sleep 
is important to avoid overtraining82 87 92 101 102 and maximise 
training gains by regulating adaptive release of hormones such as 
testosterone103–106 and growth hormone.107–111 Conversely, sleep-
iness and fatigue are associated with poor athletic outcomes.83 85
Circadian dysregulation—a misalignment between the individ-
ual’s sleep–wake pattern and the desired pattern or the pattern 
regarded as the norm—is common in athletes, especially those 
who frequently travel across time zones. Circadian rhythms 
are important for metabolism,112–114 performance,91 115–121 
and psychological function.122–126 Disrupted circadian rhythms 
decrease athletic performance.127–129 The timing of sport 
training, especially in the early morning, can impair sleep72 
and lead to suboptimal performance outcomes. Because of an 
athlete’s chronotype (degree to which an individual is naturally 
a 'morning' or 'evening' person), timing of training or compe-
tition may not align with their personal time of peak perfor-
mance.130–132 Persistent circadian dysregulation may contribute 
to neurodegeneration and mental health disorders.133–135
Insomnia disorder—a persistent difficulty initiating or main-
taining sleep at least 3 nights per week for at least 3 months (in 
the context of adequate sleep opportunity and accompanied by 
daytime impairments)—136 is a major risk factor for mood and 
other mental health disorders137–139 and impaired physical func-
tion.140 Insomnia disorder may be very common among athletes; 
approximately 64% of Olympic athletes reported significant 
insomnia symptoms.79 Insomnia is associated with impaired 
athletic performance.141
Sleep apnoea involves periodic reduction or cessation of 
breathing during sleep.136 Due to its relationship with higher 
body mass, sleep apnoea is especially common among Amer-
ican football players142–145 and many are at high risk for sleep 
apnoea.142 146 However, high body mass is not required for 
sleep apnoea, and many with the disorder remain undiag-
nosed.147 Additionally, training at altitude can produce central 
sleep apnoea.148 Untreated sleep apnoea, regardless of aeti-
ology, increases fatigue and dramatically impairs athletic perfor-
mance149–155 if untreated.
Addressing sleep problems in elite athletes requires screening 
for primary sleep disorders (such as circadian dysregula-
tion, insomnia disorder or sleep apnoea), since solely treating 
comorbid mental health symptoms or disorders (such as depres-
sion or anxiety) will likely be unhelpful unless any primary sleep 
disorders are properly treated.156 A questionnaire validated for 
use in athletes may help identify athletes who need further sleep 
assessment.157 At the team level, the sports medicine team can 
promote healthy sleep by: (i) ensuring coaches model healthy 
sleep and schedule training around sleep and circadian rhythms; 
(ii) encouraging healthy sleep as part of the training protocol; 
(iii) promoting sleep health education; and (iv) engaging in 
proactive tracking and monitoring of sleep.
Non-pharmacological treatments are often recommended to 
treat sleep disorders in athletes because many medications are 
associated with increased injury risk and may cause side effects 
(eg, slowed reaction time, cognitive impairment) that may impair 
athletic performance.158 159 Non-pharmacological treatments 
(collectively described as 'behavioural sleep medicine') are avail-
able for many sleep disorders.160 The recommended treatment 
for insomnia is CBT for insomnia (CBTI); its effects are at least 
as good as those of medications,161 162 without the associated 
side effects. Further, CBTI is effective in the presence of comor-
bidities, such as chronic pain, depression and sleep apnoea.163

Consensus statement
Table 1  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode1
At least 5 symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks (at least 1 of the symptoms must be depressed mood, or decreased interest or pleasure):
►
►Depressed mood or (in children) irritable most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either 
subjective report (eg, feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (eg, appears tearful)
►
►Decreased interest or pleasure in most activities, most of each day
►
►Significant weight change or change in appetite
►
►Insomnia or hypersomnia
►
►Change in activity: psychomotor agitation or retardation
►
►Fatigue or loss of energy
►
►Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
►
►Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness
►
►Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide
Sleep hygiene alone is often insufficient for more complex prob-
lems.83 164
Athletes taking any sleep aids should be advised of the impor-
tance of allowing a full night of restorative sleep.60 Melatonin, 
which may be prescribed or purchased over the counter, is a 
preferred choice of sports psychiatrists for insomnia.57 Addition-
ally, it is the best studied sleep aid in athletes.57 Neither imme-
diate release nor extended release melatonin adversely impact 
performance.56 60 165 166 Rarely, melatonin may cause hypoten-
sion.167 However, although melatonin often helps to ameliorate 
sleep problems, it may have limited utility for those with more 
extreme sleep difficulties, including insomnia disorder.168 Addi-
tionally, over the counter melatonin may contain impurities and 
unknown quantities of melatonin; athletes should purchase it 
only from a reputable company.60 If a supplement such as mela-
tonin includes any prohibited substances, and an athlete ingests 
them unknowingly, the athlete will be held accountable if found 
to have an adverse analytical finding for a prohibited substance. 
Ignorance of ingredients or improper labelling of supplements 
is not excusable under the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) 
code.60
If melatonin does not help an athlete with insomnia, trazodone 
and gabapentin are sometimes used, although they have not been 
studied specifically in athletes,57 and there is no evidence base 
to support their efficacy for insomnia disorder.168 Imidazopyr-
idines (eg, zolpidem and zopiclone) may be options if needed57 
and are effective medications for insomnia disorder.168 They 
have less of an impact on next day physical performance than 
benzodiazepines.169–173 Among the benzodiazepines, agents with 
longer half lives have a more detrimental impact on next day 
physical performance compared with shorter acting agents.174 
This finding must be considered alongside the knowledge that 
benzodiazepines with shorter half lives are more likely to cause 
physical dependence and substance use disorders.175
For sleep apnoea, the recommended treatment is usually posi-
tive airway pressure therapy.176 Oral appliances are also recom-
mended for some individuals,177 and in rare cases, airway surgery 
may be required.178 For circadian rhythm disturbances, mela-
tonin is the treatment of choice and has established efficacy in 
many populations,179 although its dose and timing for schedule 
shifting are different than for sleep promotion. Typically, this 
involves lower doses timed earlier in the evening (for advancing 
sleep) or the end of the night (for delaying sleep).180 181 Timed 
bright light exposure is also routinely used to shift circadian 
rhythms. Bright light at night can delay sleep onset, and early 
morning light can advance sleep onset the next night.181 182
Major depressive disorder and depression symptoms
Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience 
depressed mood and/or little interest or pleasure from activi-
ties on most days over at least a 2 week period, in addition to 
associated physical, psychological and cognitive symptoms.1 A 
diagnosis requires at least five symptoms and a negative impact 
on functioning, but individuals may also experience depressive 
symptoms without meeting the criteria for MDD (table 1).1 An 
athlete specific screening tool for depression is reliable and valid 
(Box 3).183 184
The prevalence of depressive symptoms in elite athletes ranges 
from 4%185 to 68%.35 When the research is considered in its 
entirety, the prevalence of depressive symptoms in elite athletes 
and the general population appears to be similar.186 However, 
elite athletes may not recognise or acknowledge depressive symp-
toms or may not seek support,187 in part related to stigma.188 
Female athletes may be twice as likely to report depressive 
symptoms as male athletes.186 Rates of adjustment disorder with 
depressed mood (defined as experiencing more depressive symp-
toms than would normally be expected in response to a stressful 
life event, but not to the point of those symptoms meeting 
criteria for MDD)1 and persistent depressive disorder/dysthymic 
disorder (defined as a chronic course of depression lasting at 
least 2 years)1 in elite athletes are unknown.
Different sports are associated with different risks for depres-
sive symptoms and MDD. French athletes who took part in 
aesthetic or fine motor skills sports were at greater risk of expe-
riencing depressive symptoms than those who took part in team 
ball sports.185 Among North American athletes, track and field 
athletes had the highest rates of MDD compared with those in 
other collegiate sports.29 Depressive symptoms may be more 
prevalent in individual sport athletes compared with team sport 
athletes.12 29 189
Risk factors associated with depressive symptoms and MDD 
in elite athletes include: genetic factors (eg, family history); 
environmental factors (eg, poor quality relationships, lack of 
social support);61 190 injury;39 competitive failure;39 retirement 
from sport;191 pain;192 and concussion.193 After athletes retire 
from elite sport, those with lower levels of physical activity have 
higher rates of MDD.194
Non-functional overreaching (NFO) and overtraining should 
be considered as possible relevant factors in athletes who present 
with depressive symptoms. There are no generally accepted diag-
nostic criteria for NFO and overtraining. NFO is often defined 
as the accumulation of training load without compensatory 
recovery, with resultant performance decrement and the need 
for more prolonged recovery.195 196 Overtraining is an extreme 
form of NFO that results in a prolonged performance decre-
ment (usually longer than 2 months) and more severe psycho-
logical and/or neuroendocrinological manifestations.197 198 Both 
are associated with depressed mood.199 Symptoms that overlap 
with MDD may include fatigue, insomnia, appetite change, 
weight loss, amotivation and diminished concentration.200 In an 
11 year study of 400 competitive collegiate swimmers, mood 
state disturbance increased with training stimulus during the 
season, and then fell to baseline as training load diminished.201 
One possible difference between NFO/overtraining and MDD 
in some athletes may be the nature of the dysfunction—athletic 
performance in NFO/overtraining versus social, cognitive and

work performance in MDD.193 Cessation of training in athletes 
with NFO or overtraining often improves mood and associated 
symptoms, whereas depressed athletes who do not exercise may 
experience worsened mood and lose the antidepressant effect of 
exercise.61
Depressive symptoms and MDD may result in decreased 
performance, adverse effects on personal life or an exit from 
sport.192 MDD is also highly associated with suicide and suicidal 
ideation.202 203 Treatment of depressive symptoms and MDD 
depends on the severity of symptoms but usually consists of 
psychotherapy, often with medication.
In an international survey of sports psychiatrists, most of 
whom treat elite athletes, bupropion was described as a top 
choice for use in athletes with depression without comorbid 
anxiety.57 Bupropion’s relatively energising properties and lack 
of weight gain as a side effect may have contributed to its top 
selection.57 However, it is not available worldwide,56 and should 
not be prescribed in athletes with an eating disorder because it 
increases the risk of seizure—a potential complication of eating 
disorders.204 Preliminary evidence suggests that bupropion 
potentially enhanced performance in endurance athletes who 
used a single, high dose (600 mg) in warm climates.205 Perfor-
mance enhancement was not observed with longer term ther-
apeutic bupropion treatment.206 Performance enhancement has 
been noted with 300 mg dosing the night before and morning 
of a cycling time trial in warm climates, but not at doses less 
than 300 mg.207 The research on bupropion suggests that it may 
allow athletes to push themselves to higher core body tempera-
tures and heart rates (thus improving performance) when used 
at higher doses and in acute rather than chronic doses.205 Bupro-
pion is currently on WADA’s Monitoring Programme list in 
competition.59 At present, however, it can be prescribed without 
a therapeutic use exemption (TUE), which is a process that 
allows athletes to request permission to take a medication that is 
on the WADA prohibited list.
SSRIs are also often prescribed to treat depression in 
athletes.56 57 In particular, fluoxetine has no demonstrated 
negative impact on performance,208 209 and has emerged as an 
antidepressant of choice for athletes.56 57 210 211 Serotonin and 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants 
(eg, nortriptyline, amitriptyline) and mirtazapine have not been 
studied in athletes.60 Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors are sometimes regarded as relatively energising,60 but 
one small study suggested that a norepinephrine reuptake inhib-
itor may be performance limiting.212 Tricyclic antidepressants 
and mirtazapine may cause sedation and weight gain.60 Further-
more, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias have been 
described in young, healthy people taking tricyclic antidepres-
sants.213 Blood levels of tricyclic antidepressants could become 
toxic in athletes who sweat heavily, although this concern has 
not been confirmed in research among elite exercisers.214 In 
summary, the evidence suggests that tricyclic antidepressants 
should be avoided as firstline medications in athletes56 60 and, if 
prescribed, blood levels should be monitored.60
Suicide
In the largest study of suicide in elite collegiate student athletes 
in the USA, 7.3% of all deaths were attributed to suicide.215 
Overall, the rate of suicide was 0.93/100 000 in collegiate 
athletes per year. The mean age of suicide was 20 years, and male 
collegiate athletes who participated in American football were at 
greatest risk. However, collegiate athletes still had a lower rate 
of suicide than individuals of the same age in the general US 
population (11.6/100 000 per year).216
Suicide prevention interventions should be multimodal, 
evidence based and range from interventions to manage stress 
and distress to addressing symptoms of MDD and overt suicidal 
ideation.202 203 Risk factors (table 2) should be assessed and, where 
possible, mitigated.27 217–219 To promote help seeking behaviours 
and to potentially reduce the risk of suicide, greater awareness of 
risk factors for suicide may be needed among coaches, medical 
professionals and others who work with athletes.27 29 215 Strat-
egies to understand and modify environmental stressors for 
elite athletes—such as improving social networks, athletic and 
personal life balance, team cohesion, and coach and team expec-
tations—should be considered in conjunction with treatment for 
mental health symptoms and disorders.215 With retired athletes, 
careful consideration must be given to both mental and other 
medical aspects of health while addressing social isolation and 
other stressful aspects of transition from sport.217
Anxiety and related disorders
Individuals with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) expe-
rience excessive anxiety and worry, with symptoms noted in 
table 3. GAD in elite athletes ranges in prevalence from 6.0% 
for a clinician confirmed diagnosis185 to 14.6% using self-re-
port measures.14 Consistent with the general population, GAD 
symptom ratings tend to be higher for female athletes than 
male athletes.20 24 30 190 220–222 Injured athletes appear to report 
more severe GAD symptoms than their non-injured counter-
parts.11 20 30 223 224 From the limited data available regarding 
prevalence of other anxiety disorders and related disorders in 
elite athletes (table  4), self-reported estimates include 14.7% 
for social anxiety,11 5.2% for obsessive–compulsive disorder225 
and 4.5% for panic disorder.11 Rates of GAD and these other

disorders in elite athletes do not appear to differ markedly from 
those in the general population.226 227 Rates of specific phobia, 
agoraphobia, obsessive–compulsive personality disorder and 
adjustment disorder with anxiety (the latter defined as experi-
encing more anxiety symptoms than would normally be expected 
in response to a stressful life event, but not to the point that 
those symptoms meet the criteria for another specific anxiety 
disorder)1 in elite athletes are unknown. However, adjustment 
disorder with anxiety may be more common than other anxiety 
disorders in elite athletes.228
Among elite athletes, patterns of symptom onset, duration 
and severity should be used to differentiate anxiety disorders 
from competition performance anxiety, although state and trait 
anxiety domains can overlap.229 230 In addition, other mental 
health symptoms and disorders, most notably those of depres-
sion and/or eating disorders, may be coexisting.17 21 39 185 231 232 
Pervasive worries or fears that accompany physiological symp-
toms may qualify for a diagnosis of GAD (if it persists for at least 
6 months) or panic disorder (if accompanied by an abrupt surge 
in panic related symptoms).1 Agoraphobia, social anxiety and 
specific phobias occur in the context of specific stimuli, whereas 
obsessive–compulsive disorder is characterised by intrusive 
and unwanted obsessions and/or compulsions and obsessive–
compulsive personality disorder by preoccupation with orderli-
ness, perfectionism and control in the absence of obsessions and 
compulsions.1 Fear of negative evaluation by others may differ-
entiate aspects of social anxiety from competitive performance 
anxiety.233 Panic attacks triggered by certain training or compet-
itive situations may indicate a specific phobia; unexpected panic 
attacks not triggered by a specific fear more likely signal a panic 
disorder.234 Because habitual behaviours are commonplace 
for elite athletes,235 236 idiosyncratic mannerisms or repetitive 
routines alone do not merit a diagnosis of obsessive–compulsive 
disorder in the absence of distress or impairment.1
Anxiety symptoms are reliably associated with both impaired 
cognitive performance and overall functioning in general popu-
lations,237 238 although scant research exists for elite athletes.39 
Higher ratings of self-reported anxiety (relative to moderate 
ratings) are associated with negative performance outcomes 
and skill errors in elite athletes.230 239 240 Pre-competitive (ie, 
state) anxiety is to be expected among elite athletes competing 
at major events, and the athlete’s interpretation of pre-competi-
tive anxiety may mediate the functional impact of symptoms.241 
Facilitative, rather than debilitative, perceptions of anxiety 
symptoms appear associated with more adaptive coping and 
behavioural responses.242 243
Anxiety disorders respond well to evidence based psycho-
therapy (eg, CBT), although treatment mechanisms necessarily 
vary by disorder.244 In addition to cognitive strategies addressing 
unhelpful thinking patterns or experiential avoidance, treatment 
frameworks should emphasise, as needed, graded exposure and

Consensus statement
behavioural experimentation for cases of social anxiety, response 
prevention for cases of obsessive–compulsive disorder and 
arousal reduction for those with GAD or panic disorder.245
Anxiolytic medications may be used to treat anxiety disor-
ders in elite athletes, and there are important considerations, 
including side effects and performance impairment.61 SSRIs, 
specifically escitalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine, are sports 
psychiatrists’ top choices for pharmacological treatment of 
anxiety in athletes.56 57 Buspirone, an antianxiety medication, 
has received little study in athletes; one small study suggested 
it impaired performance among recreational athletes, but only a 
single 45 mg dose was tested.246
Short acting medications, such as benzodiazepines, are not 
usually recommended for performance (situational) anxiety 
because they may impair performance.56 165 174 247 Propran-
olol and other beta blockers, sometimes used for performance 
anxiety in non-sport settings, should typically be avoided in 
sport60 because they may lower blood pressure in athletes who 
already may have relatively low blood pressure. In endurance 
sports, beta blockers can problematically decrease cardiopul-
monary capacity.248 Because of their effectiveness in reducing 
tremor and thereby improving fine motor control, beta blockers 
are prohibited at all times for archery and shooting, and are 
prohibited in competition for archery, automobile, billiards, 
darts, golf, shooting, some skiing/snowboarding and some 
underwater sports.59
Post-traumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related 
disorders
Trauma-related mental health disorders in elite athletes are 
common, with potentially serious consequences.249 These disor-
ders include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), defined as 
exposure to a trauma followed by at least 1 month of mental 
health symptoms; acute stress disorder (similar to PTSD, but less 
than 1 month in duration); and adjustment disorder (abnormal 
reaction to an identifiable life stressor).1 Athletes may encounter 
traumatic experiences from inside or outside of sport, and such 
experiences may range from sport injuries to life events indepen-
dent of a sport injury.250 251
Research on the prevalence of trauma-related disorders in 
elite athletes is limited. This is particularly true regarding trau-
ma-related disorders stemming from traumas other than sports 
injuries. Sport-related musculoskeletal injury is associated with 
elevated levels of PTSD symptomology.249 Athletes may also 
experience PTSD symptoms shortly after a sport-related concus-
sion.252 Traumatic injuries may pose an even greater risk of 
progression to a chronic trauma-related mental health disorder 
in athletes with pre-existing exposure to trauma of any type.253
Diagnosing PTSD and other trauma-related disorders in 
athletes can be challenging. Trauma-related symptoms may 
manifest at any time,254 especially during situations reminiscent 
of a prior inciting event.249 255 Such symptoms include: hyper-
arousal (commonly experienced as anxiety); avoidance of phys-
ical and psychological reminders; re-experiencing symptoms 
(eg, intrusive thoughts, nightmares or flashbacks); dissociation 
(feeling detached from one’s surroundings and/or emotions); 
and non-specific symptoms, including irritability and depressed 
mood.1 250 Athletes may also develop comorbid substance use 
disorders or eating disorders.250 Trauma-related disorders may 
be associated with inconsistent athletic performance and somatic 
complaints without evident injury.250
Athletes may engage in behaviours that can obscure trau-
ma-related symptoms. For example, elite athletes may 
compartmentalise to manage emotions, effectively concealing 
symptoms of trauma-related disorders.256 Further, dissociative 
strategies (eg, blocking of sensory input, as intentionally utilised 
by endurance athletes)257 may conceal trauma symptoms. Adap-
tive perfectionism, defined as deriving satisfaction from achieve-
ment from intense effort and tolerating imperfections without 
self-criticism,258 is a useful tool against symptom manifestation 
in many sports.259 However, it can evolve into maladaptive 
perfectionism, characterised by setting consistently unrealistic 
personal standards.258 This can include manifestations of obses-
sive–compulsive disorder, which can be a comorbid condition 
with trauma-related disorders.259
Symptoms of trauma-related disorders may negatively impact 
athletic performance.249 260 261 Additionally, fear of re-injury 
increases the risk of subsequent injuries because of avoidance, 
inhibited effort or risk seeking behaviours.249 262 Injured athletes 
may hesitate to undergo physical therapy because of avoid-
ance, thus interfering with recovery.260 Psychological distress, 
commonly seen in trauma-related disorders, reduces immune 
function and delays healing, thus impeding the athlete’s ability 
to participate in rehabilitation following an injury.261
Early identification of and intervention for suspected trau-
ma-related disorders may mitigate associated morbidity.263 
Screening for mental health disorders following a sport-related 
traumatic musculoskeletal injury is recommended.264 Although 
evidence of impact on ultimate development of PTSD is mixed, 
careful, non-compulsory psychological debriefing with a qual-
ified provider for an individual and/or team, with appropriate 
follow-up and support, may reduce distress and enhance group 
cohesion in the immediate aftermath of trauma.250 Trauma 
informed management of a traumatised athlete’s team also can 
improve outcomes for the traumatised individual.265 Conversely, 
blaming the individual for the traumatic situation may perpet-
uate symptoms of trauma.250 Passive attitudes, non-intervention, 
denial and silence by those in power may also compound the 
initial trauma.266 Psychotherapeutic modalities recommended 
for the treatment of trauma-related disorders include CBT, 
cognitive processing therapy, cognitive therapy and prolonged 
exposure therapy.267 If medications are needed, SSRIs such as 
sertraline and fluoxetine are generally regarded as the agents of 
choice268 and overall are reasonable choices for athletes.57
Eating disorders
Eating disorders (including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa 
and binge eating disorder) and disordered eating (abnormal eating 
behaviours not meeting criteria for an eating disorder) (table 5) 
among elite male and female athletes are common.25 269–272 
The estimated prevalence of eating disorders and/or disordered 
eating among athletes in general ranges from 0% to 19% in men 
and from 6% to 45% in women,273 considerably higher than 
in non-athletes.274 Data on elite athletes are sparser, but also 
show significantly greater risk in elite athletes than in non-ath-
letes.23 241 Elite athletes more commonly meet criteria for disor-
dered eating than for eating disorders.275 Data have largely 
relied on self-reports. However, athletes are prone to denial of 
symptoms, and are more apt to underreport disordered eating 
than are non-athletes.23
Athletes possess some of the same risk factors for eating disor-
ders as the general population, and some that are sport specific 
risks (table 6).273 More than 60% of elite female athletes from both 
leanness focused and non-leanness focused sports have reported 
body shaming pressure from coaches.276 Eating disorders are 
common in athletes using performance and image enhancing

drugs, including anabolic androgenic steroids, amphetamine-like 
substances, coffee and caffeine derivatives, synthetic cathinones 
and ephedrine.277 Dissatisfaction with body image may be the 
strongest predictor of eating disorders in athletes.278
A diagnosis requires obtaining a detailed current and past 
history (including a corroborative history), a thorough phys-
ical examination and laboratory studies.274 Dual energy X-ray 
absorptiometry and electrocardiography are sometimes needed 
to assess possible adverse effects on bone and cardiac health.274 
Rating scales that have been validated in athletes, such as the 
Athletic Milieu Direct Questionnaire version 2, the Brief Eating 
Disorders in Athletes Questionnaire version 2, and the Physi-
ological Screening Test to Detect Eating Disorders Among 
Female Athletes, may be used.279 However, research suggests 
that personal interviews may be superior to rating scales in diag-
nosing eating disorders in athletes.280 The usual DSM-5 diag-
nostic criteria1 may be difficult to apply in athletes51 because 
the adaptive nature of a disciplined training diet and preoccupa-
tion with body shape and weight in sport may confuse the diag-
nosis.281 Additionally, athletes may present as normal weight, 
with very low body fat but high muscle mass.61 Finally, excessive 
exercise as an eating disorder behaviour often used to compen-
sate for a perceived excess of calories consumed can be chal-
lenging to assess in athletes.282
In elite training, athletes may present with low energy avail-
ability (LEA), which can occur secondary to inadvertent inade-
quate intake or from disordered eating. The female athlete triad 
was historically denoted by LEA, menstrual dysfunction and low 
bone mineral density.51 283 284 Male athletes may present with 
an analogous condition characterised by LEA, hypogonado-
tropic hypogonadism and low bone mineral density.285 The IOC 
convened and redefined these entities under a broader umbrella: 
relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S), which addresses the 
more global impact of relative energy deficiency on physiolog-
ical function and its psychological consequences and includes all 
genders.280 286
The fact that an eating disorder impairs athletic performance 
is a powerful motivator for treatment.278 While performance 
may not immediately suffer, typically performance decreases 
over time, related to factors such as dehydration, electrolyte 
disturbances, early glycogen depletion, loss of muscle mass and 
injuries such as stress fractures.274 278 287 288
Among the challenges in bringing an athlete to treatment are 
concerns about confidentiality,289 finding access to effective 
treatment, the athlete's acceptance that there is a problem to 
treat, the ability to relate—as an athlete—in treatment and the 
possible need to restrict activity on return to play.290 Just as team 
culture may engender disordered eating, there may be a role for 
teammates to encourage healthy eating behaviours.291
One of the first decision points in treatment is what level of 
care is required. Those who are severely nutritionally compro-
mised may need hospitalisation.274 In any setting, an interdis-
ciplinary team is ideal, and may include a psychiatrist, a sports 
nutritionist/dietitian, a primary care physician, another licensed 
mental health provider, an athletic trainer and a coach.274 Once 
a healthy nutritional status is attained, the psychological and 
sociocultural underpinnings of the disordered eating may be 
addressed through psychotherapeutic modalities in individual, 
group or family settings.292 A team may be viewed as a family 
structure, or a coach–athlete relationship may benefit from 
therapy.293
While there is little evidence that medication is helpful for 
anorexia nervosa, the primary pharmacologic treatments in 
bulimia nervosa are antidepressants, specifically fluoxetine, 
which has no evident adverse impact on performance.1 208 209 294 
Lisdexamfetamine may be helpful for binge eating disorder295 
but it is a stimulant and thus is prohibited in competition at elite 
levels of competition and requires a TUE.59
Although early detection and treatment are critical, preven-
tion of eating disorders is also important.273 296 Overall, the body 
of research on eating disorder prevention programmes with elite 
athletes is small but promising.296 Elements common to seem-
ingly successful prevention programmes include involvement 
of multiple targets for systematic change (eg, athletes, coaches 
and sport administration),296–298 and utilisation of interactive 
programmes that encourage multiple modes of communication

(eg, with athletes leading some of the session, use of practical 
skills assignments and provision of a safe space for athletes to 
express their experiences of body shape and weight).296–298 
Athletes should be educated to recognise signs and behaviours 
that may be associated with eating disorders and RED-S, 
including overexercise, rigid eating patterns, amenorrhoea, a 
focus on thinness and a competitive comparison of physiques.299 
A strong coach–athlete relationship may protect against eating 
disorders.300 Coaches need to understand the physiologic 
importance of proper nutrition and weight management.301–303 
Coaches should feel comfortable discussing eating disorders and 
RED-S with athletes.299 One strategy to decrease stigma is to 
reframe these disorders as a continuum of sport-related injury 
and illness.304
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
The essential features of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) are a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyper-
activity–impulsivity causing dysfunction and present in multiple 
spheres since prior to the age of 12 years (table 7). A formal 
diagnosis of ADHD may be made based on patient history, using 
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.1 Other data, such as those obtained 
from neurocognitive testing, laboratory results and collateral 
information, may support a diagnosis, rule out other conditions 
or both.305
Using DSM-5 criteria, 30% of those diagnosed with ADHD 
in childhood continue to meet ADHD criteria as adults.306 307 
There are scant data regarding the prevalence of ADHD in 
elite athletes; however, ADHD may be more common than in 
the general population, since individuals with ADHD may be 
drawn to sport due to the positive reinforcing effects of physical 
activity.306 308 However, the sport-related hyperactivity mani-
fest in some athletes must be distinguished from diagnosable 
ADHD.309
Athletes with ADHD who suffer concussions should be eval-
uated for comorbid or persistent concussion symptoms, since 
there is symptom overlap between concussion and ADHD.310–314 
Both conditions affect similar neurocognitive domains, resulting 
in possible deficits in memory, attention and concentration.315 316 
Collegiate athletes with ADHD are more likely to report a past 
history of concussions than those without ADHD, and ADHD 
may be associated with prolonged recovery following sport-re-
lated concussion in athletes.317 318
ADHD may negatively affect athletic performance.305 Lack of 
focus and concentration, oppositional behaviour, argumentative 
attitude, frustration, lowered self-esteem and labile mood may 
all interfere with performance.305 ADHD may cause academic 
difficulties that could threaten the academic eligibility of student 
athletes.305 Additionally, commonly described comorbid condi-
tions such as anxiety, depression and substance use disorders 
may negatively impact performance.305 However, some individ-
uals with ADHD naturally excel in sport because of quick and 
reactive decision making due to inherent impulsivity.319
In managing ADHD in elite athletes, psychosocial interven-
tions should be used;57 these interventions may be as effective 
as—and should be considered an alternative to—stimulant medi-
cation in athletes with mild functional impairment.306 309 320–325 
Depending on the age of the elite athlete, treatment may 
include: behaviour therapy or CBT; individual education plans; 
parent teaching/training and caregiver support; and education 
for athletes, families and coaches.308 321 326
Stimulants are a primary pharmacological treatment for 
ADHD.62 211 306 309 321 322 324 325 327 Such medications, including 
those in the methylphenidate and mixed amphetamine salts 
classes, may be ergogenic,328 329 and are misused because of the 
perception of performance enhancement.306 322 324 325 327 330 Like 
classic stimulants, the psychostimulant modafinil reportedly 
may mask symptoms of fatigue.331 Stimulants may be misused 
for weight loss as a performance advantage in leanness sports 
(eg, distance running) or in sports with weight classes (eg, wres-
tling).309 327 Stimulants are prohibited by WADA in competi-
tion,59 332 so athletes taking them for legitimate medical reasons 
must receive a TUE.333
Athletes taking stimulants may be able to exercise to higher 
core body temperatures without perceived thermal stress,212 
thereby raising concerns about both performance enhancement 
and safety.212 Stimulants may cause several side effects, including 
insomnia, anxiety, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and 
an undesired decrease in appetite, all of which can negatively 
impact performance and threaten athlete safety.211 306 309 322 324 325
Given these concerns, if medications are necessary for an 
athlete with ADHD, non-stimulant medications should be consid-
ered.309 324 327 334 The non-stimulant atomoxetine is a medication 
of choice for ADHD among sports psychiatrists, presumably 
owing to the regulatory and safety drawbacks of stimulants.57 
However, it has not been studied in elite athletes. In addition, 
prescribers and athletes should be aware that it takes much 
longer to see full benefit from atomoxetine than from stimu-
lants,309 and gastrointestinal discomfort and sedation are possible 
side effects.327 Bupropion, an antidepressant with some stimu-
lant properties, is sometimes used off label for ADHD,306 322 335

especially for individuals with comorbid depression. Clonidine 
and guanfacine in extended release formulations are approved in 
some countries for use in children under the age of 18 years with 
ADHD (which could include elite athletes).325 336 These latter 
two medications have not been studied in elite athletes, but seda-
tion and cardiac side effects such as hypotension, bradycardia 
and QTc prolongation are possible side effects.336 337 Tricyclic 
antidepressants may also be used off label for ADHD,325 but side 
effects such as sedation, weight gain, cardiac arrhythmias and 
dry mouth may preclude their use in elite athletes.305
If stimulants are prescribed and a TUE is approved, it may 
be preferable to start with long acting formulations, which are 
more convenient and less likely to be abused.57 324 An alternative 
potential stimulant prescribing strategy involves use of formu-
lations and timing that allow use only during school, study and 
work times—not during practices and competition—thereby 
decreasing concerns about safety and impact on perfor-
mance.57 324 327 A final important consideration is that prescribers 
must use caution in prescribing stimulant medication if the 
athlete is participating in endurance events in hot temperatures 
because of the possible increased risk of heat illness.60 306 322 324
Bipolar and psychotic disorders
Bipolar disorders are characterised by major changes in mood 
with associated functional impairments (Box 4). Mood changes 
may be depressive, hypomanic, manic or occasionally with 
mixed symptoms.1 Psychotic symptoms need not be present, 
but if so are usually consistent with the individual’s mood.1 
Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and related condi-
tions are usually characterised by hallucinations and delusions. 
In addition, schizophrenia may involve disturbances in speech, 
thought, behaviour, affect and cognition, in addition to social 
deficits and significant functional impairment.1
Bipolar and psychotic disorders have not been thoroughly 
studied in elite athletes;61 although prominent cases have been 
reported,338 the prevalence is unknown. Both disorders show a 
peak age of onset coincident with the usual age of peak sporting 
performance;339 thus it is important for clinicians and other key 
professionals in the world of sport to be aware of their symp-
toms. In cases of mania and hypomania, the diagnosis may be 
obscured if sport provides a functional outlet for excess energy, 
or if overactivity is normalised.340
It is important to distinguish primary mood and psychotic 
disorders from the impact of substance use (secondary 
disorders), as the latter may be self-limiting or require only 
short term treatment (table  8).341 For example, anabolic–an-
drogenic steroid use may be associated with psychotic, hypo-
manic or depressive symptoms.342 343 Other substances used 
by athletes, including stimulants, cannabinoids and glucocor-
ticoids, may also be associated with mood or psychotic symp-
toms.344 345
There are scant data on how bipolar and psychotic disorders 
affect athletic performance. The long term course of bipolar 
disorders is variable, and patients may spend a significant 
amount of time in a symptomatic (often depressed) state.346 347 
However, some athletes have achieved sporting success despite 
this condition.
Cognitive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia cause 
significant impairment of function348 349 likely to interfere with 
the demands of elite sport.51 Conversely, physical activity may 
be beneficial for symptoms of bipolar and psychotic disor-
ders,350–352 although some evidence suggests that vigorous exer-
cise may exacerbate mania in patients with bipolar disorder.351 
Supported strategies to exit from an elite sports level, perhaps 
to a lower level of participation, should be considered if this 
strategy would allow the individual to continue to benefit from 
physical activity.
There is limited evidence on the treatment of bipolar disor-
ders and psychosis in athletes,61 and guidance is usually based 
on expert opinion and individualised prescribing.56 Long term 
medication is often needed alongside psychotherapy interven-
tions,353–358 including family therapy, CBT and, for bipolar 
disorder, social rhythms therapy.359
Sports psychiatrists have reported preferences for lamotrigine 
and lithium in athletes with bipolar disorders.60 Lamotrigine has 
a favourable side effect profile for elite athletes, but does not 
always prevent or treat mania.56 57 Lithium is a full spectrum 
mood stabiliser, but its levels may fluctuate with intense exercise 
and hydration status,360 361 so close monitoring is advised.56 Apart 
from lamotrigine, most medications for bipolar disorder can 
cause sedation, weight gain and tremor.57 60 Among the atypical 
antipsychotics that may be used for bipolar or psychotic disor-
ders, aripiprazole, lurasidone and ziprasidone may be relatively 
less likely to cause sedation and weight gain.56 57 Ziprasidone 
may cause QTc prolongation362 and thus may not be a firstline 
choice within this class for athletes.57 Aripiprazole may cause 
akathisia, which could negatively impact motor performance in 
athletes.56 Typical antipsychotics are an infrequent choice for

psychotic disorders in athletes because of sedation, motor side 
effects and cardiac concerns.57
Sport-related concussion
Sport related concussion (SRC) is a traumatic brain injury induced 
by biomechanical forces. It may be caused by a direct blow to the 
head, face or elsewhere in the body with a transmitted impulsive 
force to the head.363 SRC typically results in short lived impair-
ment of neurological function, but signs and symptoms may 
evolve over minutes to hours. It largely reflects functional brain 
disturbances, but also may result in neuropathological changes. 
SRC manifests in a range of clinical signs and symptoms, with or 
without loss of consciousness; resolution of signs and symptoms 
usually follows a sequential course, but may be prolonged.363 
Finally, the signs and symptoms cannot be explained by drugs, 
other injuries or comorbidities.317 364 365 Changes in mood, 
emotions and behaviour are common following SRC; indeed, 
in the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, fifth edition,366 most 
symptoms overlap with those attributable to anxiety and depres-
sion.367–369 Thus SRC may be viewed as a neuropsychiatric 
syndrome.
Rice and colleagues365 performed a systematic review of 
mental health outcomes of SRC in elite athletes; of 103 studies, 
27 met the inclusion criteria for the final analysis. The most 
common mental health symptoms following SRC reported 
in these studies were depression, anxiety and impulsivity, but 
studies were primarily in male athletes, and most were from 
North America. Only one paper was judged as meeting sufficient 
methodological rigour and lack of bias: Vargas et al370 described 
depression symptoms in 20% of collegiate athletes following 
SRC. Vargas et al also reported that predictors of depression 
symptoms included baseline depression symptoms, baseline 
post-concussion symptoms, lower estimated premorbid intelli-
gence, non-white ethnicity, increased number of games missed 
following injury and age of first participation in organised sport 
(more depression symptoms noted in athletes with fewer years of 
experience in organised sport).
Although acute mood and behavioural symptoms may be 
common following SRC, such symptoms must be differenti-
ated from mental health disorders. For example, Kontos et al371 
reported significantly worse depression symptoms following 
SRC, but not at the level of major depressive disorder. No high 
quality studies exist of other mental health outcomes, such as 
alcohol or other substance use disorders, personality disturbance 
or psychotic symptoms, after SRC in elite athletes.365
Most athletes recover from SRC within 7–10 days.372–374 
However, up to 21% of athletes remain symptomatic after 30 
days.374 Delayed recovery has often been diagnosed as ‘post-con-
cussion syndrome’. This label assumes the presence of common 
influencers of delayed recovery, but it lacks consensus criteria or 
clinical specificity, and subsumes varied presentations not clearly 
associated with the concussive injury.1 363 375–383 Since SRC is 
not a homogenous entity, persistent symptoms are increasingly 
described within specific, but often overlapping, post-concus-
sion subtypes and should be managed as such.384
The development of depression, anxiety or other mental 
health symptoms or disorders following SRC may adversely 
impact recovery.385 386 Further, pre-injury mood and/or other 
mental health disorder, family history of mental health disorder 
and high life stressors before injury all negatively impact SRC 
recovery.387 Multiple SRCs may predispose to the development of 
clinically significant depression. Kerr et al388 reported a 5.8-fold 
increased risk of depression after 5–9 concussions in retired 
professional football players, and Guskiewicz and colleagues389 
described a 3-fold increased risk of depression following three 
or more SRCs among retired football players. Similarly, Kerr et 
al390 reported a higher prevalence of moderate/severe depression 
among former collegiate football players with a history of three 
or more concussions. Although Fralick and colleagues391 found 
a twofold higher risk of suicide in individuals who experienced 
concussion and/or mild traumatic brain injury, this study was not 
athlete or sport specific, and included the general population. Of 
note, the risk of suicide in former professional football players is 
significantly lower than in the general population.392
Diagnosis of SRC and associated mental health symptoms 
or disorders can be challenging.365 For example, there are no 
objective imaging or blood biomarkers for SRC.373 Nonetheless,

Consensus statement
neuropsychological evaluation may help differentiate cognitive 
from other mental health manifestations.393–397
After an SRC, management of persistent mental health 
symptoms and/or disorders should first address factors that 
can contribute to delayed recovery, which may include several 
biopsychosocial issues.365 398–401 Because many athletes with 
prolonged concussive symptoms reduce their daily exercise 
markedly, a progressive increase in exercise often ameliorates 
mental health and somatic symptoms.399 400 402 Additionally, 
social activity, including team activities, should not be restricted, 
as such a restriction has been associated with increased depres-
sion following an SRC.403 Psychotherapy may be helpful for both 
mental health and somatic symptoms.375 404 405 Athletes with 
pre-existing or post-SRC substance use disorders may be more 
likely to report more SRC symptoms;406 407 thus ascertaining 
substance use patterns in elite athletes with SRC is important.
There are no approved pharmacological interventions specific 
to SRC and its sequelae, and evidence to support use of specific 
medications is minimal.408 While the majority of concussed 
athletes recover relatively quickly and thus will probably not need 
medications,374 when such an approach is warranted, targeted 
treatment beginning with a lower starting dose and a prolonged 
titration interval is generally indicated.409 410 Intervention for 
insomnia following SRC should focus on sleep hygiene;408 
however, if a sleep aid is warranted, melatonin may be consid-
ered408 411 412 with trazodone as a second option.374 408 413 414 
Benzodiazepines should be avoided because of their negative 
effect on cognition.408 413 414 SSRIs may be helpful to treat 
depressed mood following SRC,408 410 413 415 416 and may simul-
taneously improve cognition.415 416 Tricyclic antidepressants, 
for example amitriptyline, are sometimes used to treat head-
ache, depression, anxiety and/or insomnia in the post-SRC 
setting374 408 417–419 but side effects may limit their use in elite 
athletes.60 While some evidence exists for the use of stimulants 
to manage cognitive dysfunction such as deficits in attention and 
processing speed associated with SRC,408 413 415 420–423 they carry 
risks415 and are prohibited in competition by WADA without an 
approved TUE.59
Substance use and substance use disorders (ergogenic and 
recreational)
Elite athletes use alcohol, caffeine, cannabis/cannabinoids, nico-
tine and other substances that can be misused for similar reasons 
as non-athletes.345 424 These reasons can include experimenta-
tion, socialisation, pleasure, boosting confidence and increasing 
alertness and energy. Elite athletes may also use substances for 
relief of stress, negative emotions, pain, cravings and with-
drawal.345 424 Athletes may use ergogenic substances,425 doping 
methods such as gene doping426 427 and blood transfusions,428 
and neuromodulation (eg, transcranial stimulation).429 430 
Further, athletes may unwittingly ingest ergogenic substances 
by taking dietary substances that contain adulterants.431 These 
practices seek to enhance performance via hoped for increases in 
strength, power, endurance, aggression, concentration, oxygen 
carrying capacity of the blood and lean body mass; reductions 
in fatigue and percent body fat; and enhanced recovery from 
exercise and injury.345 424
The prevalence of substance use, misuse (defined as heavy, 
risky, harmful, hazardous or problem use) or full use disor-
ders as defined in DSM-51 among elite athletes varies signifi-
cantly by substance class,424 432–439 sport,5 439–445 in season 
versus out of season,434 age/level of competition,424 432 438 445–448 
gender,438 439 445 449 450 country,433 437 445 451–455 sexual orientation,456 
ethnicity,439 444 457 reasons for use424 458 and prevalence deter-
mination methods.433 459–461 Although self-report surveys and 
competition day urine drug testing are the most common 
ways of determining use or misuse, these likely are underesti-
mates.460 461 More reliable measures include: athlete biological 
passport baselines (obtaining an individual’s profile of biological 
markers of doping over time); team urine surveillance and post-
game testing; repeat testing; hair testing; early out of season 
testing; attitude scale administration; indirect questioning tech-
niques; and interviews with athletes, teammates and parents or 
coaches.460–464
A few recent high quality studies have compared substance 
use among athletes and non-athletes. Using indirect compar-
isons among US collegiate athletes and non-athletes, athletes 
across all sports report annual use of alcohol, cigarettes, mari-
juana, amphetamines, anabolic–androgenic steroids, cocaine, 
ecstasy and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at lower rates 
than their non-athlete peers.439 465 466 However, in the recent 
NCAA study (2018) and older US studies that included compar-
ison groups,432 434 448 467–472 collegiate athletes (especially white 
males) in lacrosse, ice hockey, swimming, baseball and wres-
tling use more spit tobacco473 and report higher rates of binge 
drinking and alcohol related problems than non-athletes. Female 
collegiate athletes in ice hockey, lacrosse and swimming binge 
drink at higher rates than non-athletes, while women ice hockey 
players use spit tobacco far more often than non-athletes.473 
Male and female collegiate lacrosse players have higher rates 
of use for both cannabis and cocaine.439 465 466 Recent studies 
of professional European football players from five countries6 
and professional rugby players from eight countries19 showed 
rates of adverse alcohol behaviours (regular, heavy drinking and/
or binge drinking) ranging from 6% to 17%6 and from 8% to 
21%, respectively, while a 2015 study of elite rugby players from 
Australasia using similar measures showed much higher rates of 
hazardous alcohol use both before (68.6%) and during (62.8%) 
the season.14 At the collegiate level, a 2017 study by Zanotti et al 
using the Psychiatric Diagnostic Survey Questionnaire (N=304) 
showed rates of DSM IV alcohol abuse/dependence of 7.2% to 
10.3%,474 confirming previous reports about collegiate athletes’ 
relatively high rate of alcohol misuse.432 448 468
The most commonly used substances by elite athletes across 
countries, sports and genders are alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, 
cannabis/cannabinoids, stimulants and anabolic–androgenic 
steroids.425 434 435 437 444 459 475–477 Marijuana (inhaled and/or 
ingested) has replaced nicotine as the second most widely used 
drug among some elite adolescent and collegiate athletes; it 
is more likely to be used in places where it is legal, which are 
becoming increasingly common.437 439 478 Despite relatively low 
rates of use, synthetic cannabinoids479 and cocaine439 appear to 
be a growing problem among collegiate athletes, with uncertain 
year round trends for athletes worldwide.
The sports with the highest general substance use/misuse 
rates across all substances for men’s elite sports are lacrosse, ice 
hockey, football, rugby, baseball, soccer, wrestling, weightlifting, 
skiing, biathlon, bobsleigh and swimming, and lowest for track, 
tennis and basketball.439 443 459 480 For women’s elite sports, the 
highest rates occur in ice hockey, gymnastics, lacrosse, softball, 
swimming and rowing, and lowest in track, tennis, basketball 
and golf.439 443 459 480 In general, those who participate in team 
sports are more likely to use or misuse substances than athletes 
in individual sports.439 442
Common risk factors for use include: sport context and culture 
(eg, normative beliefs about heavy peer drinking or illicit drug 
use); situational temptation (eg, drinking games); permissive

Intrinsic religiosity has been inversely associated with the use of 
alcohol, marijuana and other drugs.484
Substances most commonly used by elite athletes may cause 
performance enhancement, decrement or both, and the net 
impact may vary by sport and athlete. Some athletes may use 
alcohol before competition to reduce anxiety or tremor and 
improve subjective self-confidence.54 442 485 Alcohol is no longer 
a prohibited substance in competition in specified sports.59 
Post-competition, alcohol is used by some athletes to reduce 
stress, boost self-esteem, increase social connectedness, improve 
team cohesion, strengthen athletic identity and raise subjective 
happiness.54 442 485 Ergolytic effects of alcohol include dehy-
dration, insomnia, higher injury rates, slower injury healing, 
impaired psychomotor skills, hangovers, accidents, lateness, 
missing important obligations, reduced metabolic recovery/
glycogen re-synthesis, impaired thermoregulation, weight gain 
and academic underperformance that can threaten athletic eligi-
bility.424 485 486
Although some elite athletes speculate that cannabis/canna-
binoids increase the likelihood of obtaining restorative sleep 
before a competition, reduce pre-competition stress and anxiety 
to allow for optimal relaxation, or reduce physical pain, no 
studies have shown a beneficial effect on performance.486 487 In 
fact, since cannabis is likely to raise heart rate and blood pres-
sure and impair reaction time and coordination,486 it might 
be expected to limit performance. Regular or heavy cannabis/
cannabinoid use may reduce motivation, activate anxiety, trigger 
psychosis488 or produce temporary disorientation, delirium or 
aggression.489 490
Ergogenic effects of anabolic–androgenic steroids include 
enhanced muscle mass, improved biomechanical efficiency and 
anti-catabolic effects.491 Potential ergolytic effects include cogni-
tive impairment,492 negative mood symptoms,345 psychosis,345 
aggression345 and injury, especially tendon rupture.345 Some 
individuals who use anabolic–androgenic steroids have muscle 
dysmorphia, a preoccupation that one’s body is not sufficiently 
lean and muscular, often with significant body image distor-
tion.493–495 Cycles of using anabolic–androgenic steroids are 
usually interspersed with drug free periods and are sometimes 
associated with other drug use (eg, diuretics or benzodiazepines) 
to mitigate side effects.424 491 These other drugs themselves may 
have ergolytic effects.56 165 174 247
Stimulants may be attractive to elite athletes because they 
may improve reaction time and concentration, increase arousal, 
improve memory, boost energy, trigger relaxation and confi-
dence, and improve energy when fatigued.309 424 475 486 496 497 
Their negative effects, however, are more apparent in high 
doses or when combined ('stacked'), which may be relatively 
common among male athletes who use performance enhancing 
substances.424 452 Athletes may knowingly or unknowingly 
consume large amounts of caffeine in dietary supplements, and 
larger caffeine doses do not appear to increase performance 
and indeed are more likely to cause side effects.431 Ergolytic 
effects of high dose stimulant use or combination stacking may 
include anxiety, insomnia, gastric irritation, tachycardia and 
tremors.309 424 476 486
Nicotine, whether smoked (eg, via cigars, cigarettes or 
hookahs), used orally (eg, via moist snuff, snus or leaf tobacco) 
or vaped, is also widely used by elite athletes.439 Nicotine 
is currently being studied by WADA because of its poten-
tial ergogenic effects on performance and because it is so 
widely used in some sports, especially baseball, ice hockey and 
lacrosse.59 486 Athletes’ perception of nicotine’s ergogenic effects 
include improved alertness and concentration, increased energy 
and focus, increased muscular strength and power, enhanced 
endurance, relaxation/calmness, weight control and reduction of 
boredom, although the results of higher quality studies gener-
ally do not support ergogenesis.424 475 486 Ergolytic effects may 
include elevated blood pressure, anxiety, insomnia and chronic 
respiratory infections.424 475 486 Potential performance enhance-
ment and decrement associated with other substances by elite 
athletes, not described in detail here, are documented elsewhere 
in the literature.345
Interventions for regular, risky or disordered use of substances 
in elite athletes are not well studied. Nonetheless, approaches 
to reducing spit tobacco use among baseball players424 498 499 
and newer approaches to service delivery models for mental 
health and substance use disorders in elite athletes provide some 
guidance.339 500 For spit tobacco use, two approaches used the 
pre-season physical and dental examinations as an opportu-
nity to screen for heavy nicotine use and examine players for 
oral lesions. If screening is positive, then a brief intervention 
by a dental technician or a substance counsellor experienced in 
tobacco cessation is delivered. In one study,498 after 10 years of 
annual oral examinations and dental technician interventions, 
spit tobacco use dropped from 41.1% to 25.6% of players. 
In more recent models of service delivery, experienced sports 
clinicians are onsite with teams to integrate substance screen-
ings and brief interventions with other health screenings and 
interventions.339 500 One model uses experienced mental health/
substance providers, who work with the team all year, to conduct 
screenings for substance use/misuse at the time of the pre-season 
physical and carry out follow-up evaluations and treatments for 
those who screen positive. This approach has led to increasing 
service utilisation rates and problem identification at earlier 
stages, when problems are easier to treat.424 500 Finally, drug 
testing is a known deterrent to substance use among athletes,501 
and research suggests that increased frequency of drug testing, 
including during high risk time periods (eg, immediately after a 
game when athletes are socialising or early in the post-season), 
may diminish illicit drug use among elite athletes.462
Brief individual or group interventions delivered by clinicians, 
sometimes with key family members or members of the athlete’s 
entourage in attendance, may successfully prevent or diminish 
binge drinking or other substance use in collegiate athletes.502–505 
Similarly, binge drinking may be successfully diminished when 
athletic trainers and academic advisors screen for and deliver 
brief motivational interventions.506 Group therapy, as an adjunct 
to medication treatment, is effective when addressing substance 
use disorders among professional athletes.14 478 507 No research 
on the use of self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous 
or Narcotics Anonymous or intensive outpatient or residential 
treatment of elite athletes is available. While these treatments 
are evidence based in other populations, concerns about confi-
dentiality may limit elite athletes’ willingness to participate in 
self-help groups.508
There are no pharmacological studies on treatment of 
substance use disorders in elite athletes. Such treatment is gener-
ally grounded in psychosocial modalities, and pharmacotherapy 
is used to manage withdrawal and cravings and to treat comorbid

Consensus statement
Table 9  Features of 'exercise addiction' versus normative/adaptive exercise in elite athletes538 738–741
Exercise addiction
Normative/adaptive exercise in elite athletes
►
►Tolerance: the need to increase the exercise duration, frequency and/or intensity to 
perceive the desired benefit and to satisfy 'cravings' for it
►
►Fluctuation in amount of exercise as expected at various points in the training 
cycle
►
►Withdrawal: depressive or anxious symptoms or irritability when the individual suddenly 
reduces or stops exercise, with possible difficulty performing professional or social 
activities as a result of these symptoms
►
►Mild depressive or anxious symptoms or irritability are possible when the 
individual suddenly reduces or stops exercise, but these symptoms do not cause 
functional impairment
►
►Continued exercise despite knowing that it is causing physical, psychological and/or 
social problems
►
►Ability to stop or cut down on exercise as recommended (eg, if an injury or 
illness could be worsened by continued exercise at the same level)
►
►Inability to reduce or manage exercise, despite the desire to do so
►
►Feeling of control over exercise, which occurs according to planned training
►
►Elimination of other life activities (eg, previously desired social, occupational or 
recreational activities) to accommodate increasingly time consuming exercise regimens
►
►While exercise may take a substantial amount of time, other life activities that 
are important to the individual are not completely eliminated
mental health symptoms or disorders, such as insomnia, anxiety 
or depression.508 There are unique implications for treatment 
of opioid use disorder in elite athletes because treatment often 
involves use of opioid agonists (eg, methadone and buprenor-
phine). Since these are prohibited in competition by WADA,59 
elite athletes falling under WADA’s governance require a break 
from training and competition if such an approach is utilised.53 
Because alcohol is the most commonly used substance among 
elite athletes, alcohol use disorder may occur in this population; 
naltrexone, acamprosate and disulfiram are treatment options 
for this disorder when cravings are strong or persistent and when 
the athlete is unable to stop use on their own.53 Since heavy oral 
nicotine use is also seen frequently in some sports and can be 
accompanied by tolerance, physiological dependence and crav-
ings, pharmacological strategies for moderate to severe nico-
tine use disorders in elite athletes should be considered. These 
include nicotine replacement therapy with or without bupro-
pion, varenicline or bupropion plus varenicline.509–511 Electronic 
cigarettes or nicotine vaping devices are not recommended for 
use in elite athletes since their safety and effects on respiratory 
function have not been established.512 513
Gambling disorder and other behavioural addictions
Many behavioural addictions may negatively impact an athlete’s 
functioning, but most studies have focused on gambling 
disorder.514 Gambling disorder, as described by the DSM-5,1 
involves at least 12 months of persistent and recurrent problem-
atic gambling with resultant negative consequences. Individuals 
with gambling disorder report decreased athletic and academic 
performance, comorbid mental health symptoms and disorders 
(eg, anxiety, depression and substance use disorders), interper-
sonal difficulties and legal concerns (theft or embezzlement to 
support their gambling).514–516
Along with technological advances, attitudes toward gambling 
have changed. It is now a socially accepted, easily accessible form 
of entertainment.517 Gambling disorder is regarded as a 'hidden 
disorder', and mental health professionals have reported rela-
tive lack of awareness and concern about gambling as a poten-
tial problem.518 Relatively few studies have examined the impact 
of gambling disorder. Elite athletes may be particularly at risk 
for gambling disorder, given their overrepresentation of young 
males, which is a known high risk group.514 519–521 Additional 
risk factors for elite athletes include their desire for competition 
and challenges, high levels of sensation seeking and impulsivity, 
and increased risk taking behaviours.522–525
Early studies that assessed North American collegiate athletes 
found prevalence rates of disordered gambling between 5.2%526 
and 6.2%.527 Weiss and Loubier521 reported that both former and 
current athletes had the greatest likelihood of problem gambling 
(13.0% and 7.0%, respectively) compared with non-athletes 
(3.0%). In the NCAA’s study of North American collegiate 
athletes between 2004 and 2016, over 84 000 male collegiate 
athletes self-reported prevalence rates of disordered gambling of 
between 0.7% and 2.0%. However, those athletes at risk (not 
meeting the clinical criteria for gambling disorder, but self-re-
porting serious gambling related problems) comprised between 
1.1% and 2.9% of the sample.522 Thus the results suggest that 
between 1.8% and 4.0% of respondents have serious gambling 
related problems. Importantly, assessment measures have differed 
among studies, as have the availability and accessibility of 
gambling opportunities. Additionally, the NCAA study assessed 
athletes where gambling by collegiate athletes was prohibited. In 
a study among professional athletes from Spain, France, Greece, 
Ireland, Italy, Sweden and the UK, 56.6% participated in some 
form of gambling during the past year, and 8.2% had a gambling 
problem (either current or in the past). In particular, problem 
gambling was related to wagering on one’s own team, betting 
online and gambling regularly.520
Several other behavioural disorders, including excessive 
gaming, Internet and social media use, may be of concern in 
athletes but are not DSM-5 diagnoses and have received little 
research attention. In one case study, a professional baseball 
pitcher experienced an injury after excessively playing a video 
game.528 Others have argued that Wii Sports software may be 
helpful for rehabilitation of athletic injuries.529 Some papers 
describing excessive professional gaming in electronic sports 
('e-Sports') have questioned whether professional gamers who 
spend 10 hours or more a day practising and competing are 
'addicted' to gaming or work.530–532
While also not included as a behavioural addiction in the 
DSM-5, excessive exercise shares behaviours with other addic-
tive behaviours.533 Prevalence rates of 'exercise addiction' 
among athletes have varied considerably. Szabo and Griffiths534 
reported that 6.9% of British sports science students were at risk 
for an exercise addiction. Blaydon and Linder535 reported that 
30.5% of triathletes could be diagnosed with exercise addiction, 
with another 21.6% approaching an addiction. Allegre et al536 
reported that 3.2% of ultra-marathoners displayed signs of an 
exercise addiction. Several studies have reported a significantly 
greater risk for exercise addiction in elite athletes compared 
with recreational exercisers.537 In the elite population, it may be 
challenging to distinguish exercise addiction from normative and 
adaptive high level training, but some characteristics may help 
with that distinction (table 9).537 538
Eating disorders often are comorbid with exercise addiction 
in athletes.290 539 Some researchers distinguish primary exercise 
addiction, in which there is no accompanying eating disorder 
and exercise is the primary objective, from secondary exercise

Consensus statement
Figure 2  Framework of non-accidental violence in sport, as adapted from the International Olympic Committee.266
Table 10  International Olympic Committee definitions: types of non-accidental violence in sport266
Psychological abuse
A pattern of deliberate, prolonged repeated non-contact behaviours within a power differentiated relationship. This form of abuse is at the 
core of all other forms
Physical abuse
Non-accidental trauma or physical injury caused by punching, beating, kicking, biting, burning or otherwise harming an athlete. This could 
include forced or mandated inappropriate physical activity (eg, age inappropriate or physique inappropriate training loads; when injured or 
in pain), forced alcohol consumption or systematic doping practices
Sexual abuse
Any conduct of a sexual nature, whether non-contact, contact or penetrative, where consent is coerced/manipulated or is not or cannot be 
given
Neglect
Failure of parents or caregivers to meet a child’s physical and emotional needs or failure to protect a child from exposure to danger. This 
definition equally applies to coaches and athlete entourages
addiction, in which weight loss is the objective, with exces-
sive exercise being one of the primary means in achieving the 
objective.540–542
There is a growing body of clinical evidence that behavioural 
disorders can be successfully treated.514 The most common 
approaches include motivational interviewing and CBT.514 543 
Coaches, trainers and team physicians are in a unique position 
to identify and address these concerns.522 544
Major stressors and key environmental factors 
that influence elite athlete mental health
In addition to the specific mental health issues mentioned above, 
the IOC expert group also considered the larger social environ-
ment in which elite athletes operate. We share our consensus 
findings on: harassment and abuse; how injury, performance 
and mental health interesect; barriers to seeking care for mental 
health symptoms and disorders; the athete’s transition out of 
sport; mental health emergencies; and how it may be possible 
to create an environment that promotes mental well-being and 
resilience.
Harassment and abuse (non-accidental violence)
The risk of non-accidental violence in elite sport environ-
ments—whether psychological, physical or sexual abuse, or 
neglect—requires policies and procedures to protect athletes 
(table 10).266 Non-accidental violence is the term used by the 
United Nations and the IOC to describe harms experienced by 
athletes because of an abuse of actual or perceived differen-
tials in power, based in a cultural context of discrimination.266 
Psychological abuse is considered the basis for all other forms 
of non-accidental violence and is the most prevalent in sport.545 
The four types of non-accidental violence may occur in isolation 
or in combination, and may be a one time occurrence, contin-
uous or repetitive. Non-accidental violence can manifest via 
different mechanisms, including contact, verbal or cyber mecha-
nisms, negligence, bullying or hazing (figure 2).
Non-accidental violence occurs in all sports and at all 
levels,546–548with a greater risk for psychological, physical and 
sexual abuse at the elite level.546 549 High risk sport populations 
for non-accidental violence include: child athletes;550 athletes 
who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual,transgender, or queer;551 
and athletes with a disability.549 Underreporting is a significant 
concern and limits conclusions about the prevalence of non-ac-
cidental violence of any form among elite athletes.552 Stafford 
reports that the prevalence of psychological abuse approaches 
75% in youth athletes.553 The reported prevalence of sexual 
abuse in sport ranges from 2% to 49%.554 Although there are 
few robust prevalence studies on physical abuse and neglect

Consensus statement
in sport, many public reports outline these forms of non-acci-
dental violence in sport. Male perpetrators of sexual abuse are 
reportedly more common than female perpetrators, and female 
athletes are reportedly more often victims of sexual abuse 
than male athletes.555 Perpetrators of forms of non-accidental 
violence may be team physicians,556 coaches, other members of 
the athlete entourage,557 peers or team mates.558
The impact of non-accidental violence in sport can be devas-
tating and long standing,559 including loss of self-esteem, poor 
academic performance, distorted body image, eating disorders, 
self-harm, depression, anxiety, substance use disorders and 
suicide.560 Non-accidental violence is correlated with willing-
ness to cheat or dope in sport.561 Psychological abuse can lead 
to impaired athletic performance, reduced medal opportuni-
ties, loss of sponsorship and early sport dropout.560 Childhood 
psychological abuse is a correlate of long term post-traumatic 
and dissociative symptoms in athletes.562
Athletes can also suffer from indirect non-accidental violence 
when they witness such events experienced by others and not 
stopped by others, including those in authority.563 This phenom-
enon compounds the psychological trauma of the victim, and 
deters disclosure by athletes.564 Non-accidental violence in sport 
may also affect the victim’s family, and personal, social and 
work/school relationships outside of sport.565
An athlete presenting with mental health symptoms to a clini-
cian should be asked about a history of non-accidental violence, 
either within or outside of sport.566 Sports medicine healthcare 
providers should develop the clinical competence to recognise 
non-accidental violence, manage athlete disclosures, report cases 
and treat victims, their families and their teams.556 It is impera-
tive to ensure immediate athlete safety. Multidisciplinary support 
should be the cornerstone of management.556 Support for team-
mates, the athlete entourage and family members may also be 
appropriate.556 Depending on laws where the abuse occurred, 
reporting to legal authorities may be required, for example if a 
child has been sexually abused.556
How injury, performance and mental health intersect
The relationship of injury, performance and mental health 
in elite athletes is complex.322 567–570 Elite sport has specific 
stressors that potentially increase the likelihood of injury or 
illness, including mental health disorders.222 571–576 Injury also 
can potentially unmask or precipitate mental health disorders.574 
Finally, mental health disorders can increase the likelihood of, or 
complicate recovery from, injury.222 572 573 577 Nonetheless, there 
is minimal prospective research in this area.
Injury risk factors
Psychological and sociocultural factors are potential risk factors 
for injury in sport.569 574 575 578 Psychological risk factors include 
anxiety/worry, hypervigilance, poor body image or low self-es-
teem, perfectionism, limited coping resources, life event stress (ie, 
perceived strain associated with major life event stressors such as 
the death of a family member or starting at a new school), risk 
taking behaviours or low mood state. Sociocultural risk factors 
include limited social resources, a lifetime history of sexual or 
physical abuse,579 social pressures, organisational stress (ie, asso-
ciated with an athlete’s appraisal of the structure and function 
of their sports organisation),580 stress related to negative self-ap-
praisal of athletic and academic performance, coaching quality 
(eg, poor athlete–coach relationship and communication) and 
the culture of sport and teams (eg, a mindset of 'winning at all 
costs' vs striving for continual improvement).223 569 574 581
Although there are limited prospective studies coupled with 
conflicting results regarding risk factors related to injury, life event 
stress and high stress response (ie, negative emotional responses 
after sport injury or other stressful events) consistently demon-
strate a relationship with injury risk.223 572 574 578 581–585 Life event 
stress and high stress response can cause inattention, distraction 
and increased self-consciousness while increasing muscle tension 
and impaired coordination, all of which can impair performance 
and increase the risk for injury.223 572 578 581–585 When team 
mates and coaches are sources of life event stress, there is an 
associated increased risk of both acute and overuse injuries.581 
Emotional reactivity (involuntary and overly intense emotional 
reaction) is also associated with poor on field performance and 
injury.222 586 587
Response to and recovery from injury and illness
Cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses are important 
factors associated with outcome following injury.578 The 
evidence for outcomes following illness is not well evaluated, 
but the same processes may occur as after injury. Cognitive 
responses to injury may include concerns about re-injury, doubts 
about competency, low self-efficacy, loss of identity and concerns 
about competency of the medical staff.588 Emotional responses 
to injury may include symptoms of sadness, depression, suicidal 
ideation, anxiety, isolation, lack of motivation, anger, irritation, 
frustration, changes in appetite and sleep, low vigour, disengage-
ment and burnout.7 574 Injured athletes report more symptoms 
of depression and of generalised anxiety disorder compared with 
non-injured athletes.11 Whereas emotional responses to injury 
and illness vary, problematic emotional responses are those that 
do not resolve, worsen over time or in which the symptoms seem 
excessive.569 Injury (and possibly illness) may trigger or unmask 
other behavioural responses or underlying mental health disor-
ders, including disordered gambling, disordered eating or eating 
disorders, and substance use disorders.26 30 35 192 241 389 483 589–595
Athletes 
with 
more 
positive 
cognitive, 
emotional 
and behavioural responses may have improved injury 
recovery.35 573 596–606 Higher levels of optimism and self-efficacy 
and lower levels of depression and stress are associated with 
improved recovery from injury.35 573 596–605 Examples of strate-
gies that support positive return to sport experiences include: (a) 
reducing re-injury anxieties using modelling techniques, such as 
watching videos of formerly injured athletes discussing how they 
overcame their re-injury anxieties, or pairing an injured athlete 
with another athlete proficient in certain rehabilitation exer-
cises so the less experienced athlete can learn how to execute 
the exercises correctly; (b) fostering athlete autonomy (eg, by 
explaining why they are performing rehabilitation exercises); (c) 
building confidence through functional tests and goal setting; (d) 
providing social support; (e) keeping athletes involved in their 
sport but avoiding premature return to sport; and (f) stress inoc-
ulation training when injury requires surgical intervention.604 606
Barriers to seeking care for mental health symptoms and 
disorders
Elite athletes may encounter many barriers to seeking mental 
healthcare, including stigma.188 607–615 Public stigma and self-
stigma predict a significant detrimental impact on seeking treat-
ment for mental health.616 Additionally, many athletes come 
from countries where there are few, if any, mental health services, 
and where there may also be ways of understanding and treating 
mental health symptoms and disorders outside of evidence and 
biomedically based ones.617 618 Other barriers can include lack

of mental health literacy, negative past experiences with mental 
health help seeking and busy athlete schedules.188 290 609 610
Facilitators to seeking mental healthcare among athletes 
include: having an established relationship with a mental health 
provider; positive previous interactions with mental health 
providers; perception of benefits to seeking help; a sense of 
self-efficacy to seek treatment; and the positive attitudes of 
others, especially coaches, regarding seeking mental health 
treatment.188 619 620 Even for elite athletes with positive attitudes 
toward mental health help seeking who express a willingness to 
engage psychological services, many have concerns regarding 
how they will be perceived by their peers, coaches and sport 
managers.611 612 621 Brief mental health literacy and de-stigmatisa-

but may not be enough to increase help seeking.289 502 505 622–627
Negative attitudes about mental health services are associated 
with several factors, including identification as male, younger 
age, Black (vs Caucasian) race, US (vs European) nationality, 
lower measures of openness, higher measures of conscientious-
ness, gender role conflicts and participation in physical contact 
sports.628–632 Conversely, coaches can be important advocates 
of promoting positive attitudes about mental health by being 
mindful of early identification and referral of athletes with 
possible mental health symptoms and disorders to mental health 
services.607 Moreover, athletes with stronger positive coping 
skills generally have attitudes more supportive of seeking mental 
health help.291 Finally, athletes have strong preferences for coun-
sellor characteristics, such as familiarity with their sport, same 
gender, older but still close enough in age to understand their 
lives and geographic proximity to the sports facility.633–636
Cultural issues within sport have broad reaching effects that 
impact elite athletes differently, depending on their own cultural 
identities, including gender, gender identity, sex, sexual orien-
tation, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion.55 
Cultural influences and discrimination related to cultural factors 
may leave some athletes at a performance disadvantage and set 
the stage for mental health symptoms or disorders.
As women continue to engage in elite sport opportunities, their 
participation has led to varying degrees of cultural acceptance.637 
Women competing in sports traditionally considered 'male' may 
face being marginalised and stereotyped638 and may experience 
unequal training opportunities and resources.639 Sexualisation, 
traditional gender roles, religion and ethnic beliefs all influence 
opportunities for women.640 For example, women of some reli-
gions may experience difficulty combining traditional roles with 
competition as an elite athlete, as related to religious rules about 
the body and presentation in public.640 Tension may also exist 
between what is functionally optimal for women elite athletes 
to be wearing and what is culturally deemed acceptable.641 642 
Gender stereotyping in the media may influence how women 
athletes view themselves.641 Women athletes may be stereo-
typed as 'lesbian' to keep them from playing certain sports, or 
from playing for certain coaches or with certain teams.641 Some 
professional women athletes must train outside their native 
countries643 and may struggle to find a support network and 
cultural understanding from team mates in their new location.644
Sexuality and cultural norms of masculinity in elite sport also 
impact elite athletes.645 Non-heterosexual athletes face various 
degrees of acceptance,646 and this may interfere with sports 
performance.646 647 Transgender athletes often have negative 
experiences in sports and may struggle to be accepted,648 even 
after they meet criteria allowing them to participate.649
Racial 
disparities—including 
those 
involving 
exploita-
tion, 
player–coach 
tension, 
prejudicial 
treatment 
and 
microaggressions—in addition to socioeconomic inequities, 
form barriers that may prevent equal opportunities.650–654 For 
example, access to wealth has predicted participation and success 
at the Olympic Games.655 Importantly, discrimination based on 
any aspect of cultural identity may come from several sources, 
including coaches, team mates, agents, universities, leagues, 
managers, healthcare providers or others.
Transition out of sport
Epidemiological evidence suggests that elite athletes tran-
sitioning out of sport are at risk of developing mental health 
symptoms and disorders. As in current athletes, most studies 
have relied on self-reported cross sectional data. These reports 
show that the prevalence of mental health symptoms and disor-
ders in former elite athletes ranges from 5% for adverse alcohol 
use to around 45% for anxiety and depression.13 16 22 34 590 656–661 
Few studies have prospectively explored mental health disorders 
in former elite athletes; those that have done so reported inci-
dence rates from 5% to 30% over a follow-up period of up to 
12 months.13 16 18 662
While transitioning out of elite sport, generic and sport 
specific factors are likely to interact and increase the risk of 
mental health symptoms and disorders among athletes.31 32 663 
Undesired and involuntary retirement from sport (eg, because of 
injury or deselection from sport) is especially associated with an 
increased risk of mental health symptoms and disorders among 
transitioning athletes.8 661 664–668 Concussion in sport is associ-
ated with subsequent mental health symptoms and disorders 
among retired elite athletes; however, a causal relationship has 
not been established.16 390 594 669–672 Other factors associated with 
adjustment difficulties and mental health symptoms and disor-
ders among former elite athletes include high levels of athletic 
identity, lack of retirement planning, lower educational attain-
ment, adverse life events, post-sport unemployment and chronic 
pain.9 18 662 668 673 674
Stakeholders in elite sport have considered how to protect 
and promote the long term health of elite athletes beyond retire-
ment. For example, an ‘exit health examination’ focusing on 
mental health indicators may promote sustainable health and 
quality of life.675 676 This could be particularly important for 
former elite athletes at risk for mental health disorders, espe-
cially those retiring from sport involuntarily. Additionally, thor-
ough preparation for post-sport life may help mitigate mental 
health disorders during transition out of sport.668 Accordingly, 
education programmes/seminars, practical resource centres, 
and mental and life skills training for career transition could be 
offered to elite athletes across their sport career.668 677 Finally, 
clinicians can help athletes to become aware of, develop and use 
transferable skills that may provide direction, meaning and moti-
vation in their post-sport life.660
Mental health emergencies
A mental health emergency refers to immediate risk in the 
context of a disturbed mental state.678 679 Risks are typically to 
the health and/or safety of the athlete or others.678 Data on prev-
alence in elite athletes are sparse. Some circumstances within 
sport may carry an increased risk of mental health emergencies. 
For example, deselection is linked to acute adverse emotional 
reactions.680 Sporting injuries are associated with anger and 
depression,681 which are in turn associated with an increased 
suicide risk.682 Periods of injury may also necessitate time away 
from sport and a further increased risk of suicide.683

Consensus statement
Substances misused by elite athletes may also contribute to a 
higher risk of mental health emergencies. Use of anabolic–an-
drogenic steroids is linked to hypomanic or psychotic symptoms, 
aggression and even suicide.342 343 Longitudinal studies lend 
support to these links,684 685 and symptoms are more likely with 
the high doses and multiple agents misused by athletes.341 342 
Symptoms can emerge rapidly,686 but may be self-limiting or 
require only short term treatment.341 Current users may expe-
rience mood changes with suicidal thinking and impulsivity; 
discontinuation leads some to descend into depression with 
more planned suicidal ideation.687 Both scenarios carry signif-
icant risks, and death by suicide is 2–4 times greater in male 
athletes who may have used anabolic–androgenic steroids 
compared with the general population.591 Stimulant use may 
lead to acute mood disturbance, aggression and psychosis.344 345 
Marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids are associated with acute 
psychosis,688 689 but there are no athlete specific data.
Athletes’ patterns of alcohol consumption tend more towards 
binge drinking;444 thus acute intoxication may be a more likely 
emergency presentation than physical dependence and/or with-
drawal. Retired athletes may also be at greater risk for mental 
health emergencies associated with heavy alcohol use compared 
with their non-sporting peers.690 Acute concerns in eating 
disorders are often medical (eg, fracture risk, electrolyte abnor-
malities and electrocardiographic changes) and may be severe 
enough to warrant deselection.274 286 If so, then there is a risk 
of emotional decompensation, and urgent clinical evaluation 
may be needed.691 Limited data suggest that borderline (along 
with obsessive–compulsive) subtypes are the the most common 
personality disorders found in sport.692 Borderline personality 
disorder is associated with impulsivity, risk taking, frequent 
suicidal behaviours, an unstable affect and interpersonal diffi-
culties.1 These features alone, or especially in combination, may 
promote an emergency mental health presentation.
There is little to guide the choice of pharmacological treat-
ments for mental health emergencies in elite athletes.57 Benzo-
diazepines and/or antipsychotics by oral or parenteral routes are 
all used to tranquillise a person with an acutely, severely and 
dangerously disturbed mental state.679 693 Sports specific treat-
ment concerns include the performance impact of motor symp-
toms, weight gain or sedation,56 57 but these concerns may be less 
relevant when only short term treatment is required.
When conducting an emergency mental health assessment, 
the physical environment should be uncluttered and provide 
both containment and escape routes.678 However, such envi-
ronments may be unavailable when assessing an athlete at a 
training or competition venue.694 Although pathways and avail-
able personnel may differ from country to country,339 it is best 
practice to develop and rehearse a mental health emergency 
action management plan for all relevant sport stakeholders. This 
plan should include clarity on what constitutes an emergency, 
who should be contacted and when, and familiarity with local 
emergency services and mental health legislation. Plans should 
be consistent with other emergencies in sport, such as cardiac 
arrest, heat illness and severe trauma. A review of procedures 
after any incident can be very helpful.567
Creating an environment that supports mental well-being 
and resilience
The diagnosis and management of mental health symptoms and 
disorders is a separate but related continuum with athlete well-
being.695 696 Within sport, coaches are often the primary inter-
personal interface with the athlete. They can support diagnosis 
and management of mental health symptoms and disorders by 
creating a destigmatising environment wherein mental health 
help seeking is a core function of training and self-care.697 698 
Coaches can attend to athlete stressors that may diminish well-
being and predispose to mental health symptoms and disor-
ders, including training load and recovery,699 700 injury,22 322 700 
burnout701 and retirement.241 Coaches can ensure that training 
is age and developmentally appropriate.702–704 For younger elite 
athletes, coaches can communicate the importance of mental 
healthcare to parents, thereby managing expectations about 
avoiding stressors and seeking care when appropriate.705
Coaches can foster positive psychosocial development and 
well-being by helping athletes learn to respond to stressors in 
healthy ways.698 706 707 This includes helping athletes learn skills 
that promote resilience,708 psychological flexibility,709 self-com-
passion710 and adaptation to situational demands while staying 
consistent with one’s values.709 In day to day training, coaches 
can de-emphasise achievements and outcomes and instead foster 
a process oriented mindset, in which effort and improvement are 
emphasised.711 Such an approach may help mitigate performance 
related anxiety712 and attrition from sport713 while optimising 
the positive psychological experiences of sport participation.714
Organisations can support athlete mental health by 
providing coaching education that is evidence based and effi-
cacious.622 698 715–719 Effective delivery of coaching education is 
more likely if it falls within the framework of coaching duties and 
expectations.705 Resource allocation, priorities and outcomes or 
behaviours that are rewarded (well-being vs win–loss record) 
show coaches whether mental health is viewed as an organisa-
tional priority. Intentional time allocation in the athlete’s normal 
practice schedule for learning positive psychosocial skills is asso-
ciated with better developmental outcomes.720 Sport governing 
bodies can further influence athlete mental health by requiring or 
recommending that coaches undergo mental health training.291 
Ultimately, sport can positively influence society to promote 
well-being and de-stigmatise mental health help seeking.721
Special considerations: mental health in 
Paralympic athletes
Paralympic sport is sport for people with disabilities. Paralympic 
athletes use adapted equipment or rules to make sport acces-
sible to individuals with impairments. In general, sport is often 
heralded for its ability to promote mental health, and there is a 
largely unexamined assumption that participation in Paralympic 
sport improves an athlete’s psychological well being.722 However, 
research concerning the mental health of athletes with disabili-
ties is minimal.723
Rates of mental health symptoms and disorders, specifi-
cally depression, among the general population of people with 
disabilities are reported to be higher than in non-disabled indi-
viduals.724 Nonetheless, a review of 12 studies of Olympic and 
Paralympic athletes demonstrated that most indices of well-
being (eg, physical confidence, physical self-worth, self-regard, 
self-actualisation, self-acceptance, confidence and self-efficacy) 
were similar in the two groups.725 Emerging research suggests 
that athletes making a Paralympic team may have lower rates of 
depression and anxiety than those trying out for but not making 
a Paralympic team.723 While eating disorders in Paralympic 
athletes have received little research attention, those who restrict 
their food intake may be at greater risk for complications from 
low energy availability, especially low bone mineral density, 
because of factors such as altered skeletal loading.280 Finally, 
athletes with intellectual and physical impairments, as a subset

Consensus statement
of Paralympic competitors, may have unique mental health chal-
lenges, but specific research is particularly sparse.724
Elite athletes with disability experience both sport specific 
and disability specific stressors that may contribute to mental 
health symptoms and disorders.724 Stressors that disproportion-
ately and commonly affect elite athletes with disabilities include: 
chronic pain; overtraining and injury in often complex medical 
situations (eg, with the need to distinguish sport fatigue, discom-
fort from the underlying disability and sport injuries); lack of 
sufficient adaptive sport facilities; logistical difficulties in getting 
to competition sites; challenging sleep conditions and inferior 
sleep quality in Paralympic villages; recent rapid escalation of 
Paralympic sport competitiveness and associated rapid increases 
in training demands; malfunctioning sports equipment; costs 
associated with new technology; negative coaching behaviours 
(eg, demeaning comments); and being ‘misclassified’ or assigned 
to the wrong disability category for competition.724 726–729
There is little published work on the management of psycho-
social stressors or mental health symptoms and disorders in 
Paralympic athletes. Studies that exist usually had very small 
sample sizes, did not use standardised measures of psycho-
pathology and relied on unsophisticated statistical analysis. 
Some attention has been given to the use of psychological skills 
training to promote peak performance by Paralympic athletes, 
independent of a history of mental health disorders.724 Psycho-
logical skills training entails systematically training athletes to 
use mental skills—such as regulating anxiety, sustaining moti-
vation, focusing attention and maintaining concentration—to 
enhance sport performance.724 Addressing insufficient sleep may 
be particularly relevant, as athletes with disabilities may be at 
high risk for sleep disorders.730
Given the relative prominence of research regarding social 
factors among athletes with disabilities, disability exclusion may 
be an important issue when working with these athletes.731 For 
example, Paralympic athletes may report feelings of power-
lessness and invisibility;732 accordingly, athletes with disabili-
ties benefit from coaches who are trained to be supportive of 
athletes’ autonomy,733 734 and sport performance may improve 
as a result.735 Additionally, as with non-disabled athletes, retire-
ment from sport is an important time of transition for Paralympic 
athletes.724 Many Paralympians start their careers shortly after 
the onset of disability.724 Consequently, with relatively short 
lived professional sport careers, some face the challenge of 
simultaneously needing to adjust to a relatively new disability 
and preparing for retirement from sport; providers should be 
aware of these dual transitions.723 724
Future directions
The current state of the science of mental health in elite athletes 
suggests possible future direction for additional research, change 
in clinical practice and optimisation of environmental factors. 
These include:
1.	 The relative lack of access to mental health services in 
some countries and cultures must be considered as research 
is undertaken and clinical services developed. A rigorous, 
evidence based approach to mental healthcare should 
be utilised across countries, but nuanced approaches to 
provision of that care might be needed, for example by 
incorporating into the mental healthcare team people 
such as athletic trainers, physical therapists, coaches and 
others in the athlete’s entourage and community. If mental 
healthcare for elite athletes is to be equitably available 
globally, researchers and practitioners must engage with 
any emerging evidence and lessons from the global mental 
health field.
2.	 More thorough and reliable mental health epidemiology 
in elite athletes is needed, with attention to cross cultural 
differences in manifestations of symptoms and disorders. 
There are particularly sparse data on bipolar and psychot-
ic disorders, mental health emergencies and athletes with 
disabilities.
3.	 More robust data on pre-existing mental health symptoms 
and disorders as risk factors for subsequent concussion, and 
on mental health implications of sub-concussive impact, are 
needed.
4.	 While future research should be clear about whether mental 
health symptoms versus full disorders are being measured, 
athletes with symptoms and not full disorders must remain 
a focus of research attention, as symptoms themselves can 
be problematic for elite athletes. Increased understanding 
of risk factors for development of full disorders from earlier 
symptomatic stages needs clarification within elite athletes.
5.	 More research on and subsequent recommendations for ex-
panded mental health screening of elite athletes is needed. 
Screening is often an important step to ensure that more 
affected elite athletes ultimately receive the treatment they 
need. Timing of screening must be carefully considered, 
given that risks, such as those that occur with injury, may 
increase at various times throughout an elite athlete’s ca-
reer. There may be benefit from athlete specific screening 
tools being developed across diagnostic categories where 
they do not yet exist, taking into consideration potential 
unique manifestations of these conditions in this population 
while also appreciating the limitations to sole reliance on 
rating scales in the absence of clinical interview. To be able 
to develop optimal assessment methodologies and screening 
tools, we need better understanding of the unique symptom 
manifestations in athletes, which may require both quali-
tative and quantitative study across countries and cultures.
6.	 A better understanding of physiological recovery and opti-
mum readiness—including physical and psychological—to 
return to play after an injury or illness must be developed. 
The impact of sleep on recovery and on optimum readiness 
must be considered in this context.
7.	 Additional research is needed on treatments, includ-
ing psychotherapy and pharmacological treatment, for 
mental health symptoms and disorders in elite athletes. 
Methodology should address the limitations that exist in 
the pharmacologic research to date. Cross cultural consid-
erations include types of therapies and medications/sup-
plements disproportionately used in some countries and 
cultures, but for which an evidence base may be relatively 
lacking. Pharmacological intervention for post-concussion 
mental health symptoms also needs further study, for ex-
ample addressing duration of recommended treatment for 
apparent new onset depression and anxiety associated with 
concussion.
8.	 Additional prevention strategies for mental health symp-
toms and disorders are needed. For example, comprehen-
sive strategies for preventing eating disorders and substance 
use disorders, especially within high risk elite sports, are 
needed. Furthermore, more widespread implementation 
of prevention strategies for non-accidental violence in elite 
sport is needed.
9.	 Strategies that more effectively overcome stigma for elite 
athlete populations must be developed, such that members

of this population come to understand that the 'mental 
toughness' required for success in sport is compatible with 
mental health help seeking.
10.	 A better understanding of sport as a subculture within 
society is needed, including which elements of that 
subculture are particularly conducive to positive mental 
health outcomes. While much of the research in this area 
focuses on coaching interventions, roles for other members 
of the athlete entourage, including parents and other 
caregivers through their involvement in developmental 
factors that may lead to ultimate positive adjustment 
in elite sport, should be studied. Interventions need to 
distinguish between impact on mental well-being, and on 
actual mental health symptoms and disorders.
11.	 Olympic villages and similar areas should be designed and 
assessed with sleep hygiene in mind.
12.	 Researchers need to better understand the societal and 
sport specific impact of sport sponsorship by companies 
that promote alcohol, tobacco and other products 
associated with adverse mental health outcomes in elite 
athletes.
13.	 Coaches, athletes and stakeholders should be empowered 
with relevant information so that they recognise the 
importance of creating an environment that supports 
mental wellness and mental health help seeking.
Conclusion
The IOC has committed to improve the mental health of elite 
athletes, recognising that doing so will reduce suffering and 
improve quality of life in elite athletes and serve as a model for 
society at large. The IOC hopes that all involved in sport will 
increasingly recognise that mental health symptoms and disor-
ders should be viewed in a similar light as other medical illnesses 
and musculoskeletal injuries; all can be severe and disabling, and 
nearly all can be managed properly by well informed medical 
providers, coaches and other stakeholders.
Mental health is an integral dimension of elite athlete well-
being and performance and cannot be separated from phys-
ical health. Mental health assessment and management in elite 
athletes should be as commonplace and accessible as their other 
medical care; ideally elite athletes should have access to the 
best interdisciplinary care. To advance a more unified, evidence 
informed approach to mental health assessment and manage-
ment in elite athletes, the IOC Consensus Group has critically 
evaluated the current state of the science and practice of mental 
health in elite athletes.
