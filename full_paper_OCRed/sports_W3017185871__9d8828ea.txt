The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 4.3 million confirmed cases and over 290,000 deaths globally. It
has also sparked fears of an impending economic crisis and recession. Social distancing, self-isolation and travel
restrictions have lead to a reduced workforce across all economic sectors and caused many jobs to be lost.
Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured products has decreased. In contrast,
the need for medical supplies has significantly increased. The food sector is also facing increased demand due to
panic-buying and stockpiling of food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the socio-
economic effects of COVID-19 on individual aspects of the world economy.
1. Introduction
Labelled as a black swan event [1] and likened to the economic
scene of World War Two [2], the outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease
caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-
COV-2)) has had a detrimental effect on global healthcare systems with
a ripple effect on every aspect of human life as we know it. Sohrabi
et al. highlighted the extent of the outbreak with the World Health
Organisation (WHO) declaring the COVID-19 outbreak as a global
emergency on January 30, 2020 [3]. In a response to ‘flatten the curve’
[4], governments have enforced border shutdowns, travel restrictions
and quarantine [5,6] in countries which constitute the world's largest
economies, sparking fears of an impending economic crisis and reces-
sion [7].In an attempt to understand the turmoil effect on the economy,
we summarise the effect of COVID-19 on individual aspects of the world
economy, focusing on primary sectors which include industries in-
volved in the extraction of raw materials, secondary sectors involved
in the production of finished products and tertiary sectors including all
service provision industries.
2. Primary sectors
2.1. Agriculture
The resilience of the agricultural sector has been tested by the
COVID-19 outbreak. A global crash in demand from hotels and res-
taurants has seen prices of agricultural commodities drop by 20% [8].
Countries around the world have imposed a number of protective
measures to contain the exponentially increasing spread. This includes
social distancing, avoiding unnecessary travel, and a ban on con-
gregations. Advice on self-isolation upon contact with suspected car-
riers of the virus is likely to impact the number of available inspectors
and delivery staff critical to ensuring verification and transportation of
products. This will have pronounced implications for perishable goods
such as meat and vegetables. Furthermore, markets have gone a step
further by shutting down floor trading which has impacted the ability to
exchange commodities. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is a recent
example [9]. ‘Panic buying’ is further complicating shortages beyond
supermarket shelves. The American Veterinary Medical Association

(AVMA) have expressed concern over low levels of animal pharma-
ceuticals from several large drug suppliers [10].
2.2. Petroleum & oil
During a meeting at the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) in Vienna on March 6th, a refusal by Russia to slash
oil production triggered Saudi Arabia to retaliate with extraordinary
discounts to buyers and a threat to pump more crude [11]. Saudi, re-
garded as the de facto leader of OPEC, increased its provision of oil by
25% compared to February – taking production volume to an un-
precedented level. This caused the steepest one-day price crash seen in
nearly 30 years – On March 23rd, Brent Crude dropped by 24% from
$34/barrel [12] to stand at $25.70 [13]. Although a deceleration in the
number of COVID-related deaths has caused some stabilisation of oil
prices, there is still much uncertainty.
On the background of a viral outbreak already dampening the de-
mand for oil, this oil-price war is predicted to have grave implications
for the global economy. In more ordinary times, cheap oil may have
functioned as an advantage for economies. However, savings on petrol
are unlikely to be redirected into more spending as populations are
instructed to practise social distancing and the working class are un-
certain about job security. Furthermore, any increase to consumer ac-
tivity is likely to be outweighed by damage caused to populations re-
liant on revenue from other forms of energy such as Shale gas [14].
Economic modelling from Imperial College's Centre for Climate Finance
and Investment has suggested ‘Carbon Dividends’. A £50/tonne of CO2
tax could be channeled into UK households in order to stimulate con-
sumer spending whilst keeping oil prices at the same level as February
2020 [15]. However, this relies on turbulence between Saudi Arabia
and Russia, thus should not be considered sustainable for the long-term.
3. Secondary sectors
3.1. Manufacturing industry
A survey conducted by the British Plastics Federation (BPF) ex-
plored how COVID-19 is impacting manufacturing businesses in the
United Kingdom (UK). Over 80% of respondents anticipated a decline in
turnover over the next 2 quarters, with 98% admitting concern about
the negative impact of the pandemic on business operations [16]. Im-
portation issues and staffing deficiencies stood out as the key concerns
for businesses due to disruption to supply chains and self-isolation
policies. Indeed, for many roles within a manufacturing company,
‘working from home’ is not a viable option. As the UK is adopting si-
milar protective measures to the rest of the world, and due to the global
overlap of supply chains, we can expect these anxieties to transcend
borders. The Chemical Industry is predicted to reduce its global pro-
duction by 1.2%, the worst growth for the sector since the 2008 fi-
nancial crash [17]. Major chemical manufacturing companies such as
BASF who were in the process of upscaling production in China have
had to delay their activities, contributing to a slowdown in predicted
growth [17,18].
4. Tertiary sectors
4.1. Education
COVID-19 has affected all levels of the education system, from pre-
school to tertiary education. Different countries have introduced
various policies, ranging from complete closure in Germany and Italy
[19] to targeted closure in the United Kingdom for all but the children
of workers in key industries [20]. Additionally, over 100 countries have
imposed a nationwide closure of educational facilities. UNESCO esti-
mates that close to 900 million learners have been affected by the
closure of educational institutions (Fig. 1) [21].
Whilst the intention of these closures is to prevent spread of the
virus within institutions and prevent carriage to vulnerable individuals,
these closures have had widespread socioeconomic implications.
COVID-19 has had an impact on social mobility whereby schools are
no longer able to provide free school meals for children from low-in-
come families, social isolation and school dropout rates. It has also had
a significant impact on childcare costs for families with young children.
Additionally, there exists a wide disparity amongst populations with a
higher income who are able to access technology that can ensure
education continues digitally during social isolation. In Dubai, 13,900
people have signed a petition to decrease indepedent school fees by
30% as parents struggle to source these funds amidst recent pay cuts
reaching as high as 50%, and high costs of living. Furthermore, parents
are being asked to provide schools with confidential information such
as bank statements and profit and loss company statements [22].
The impact of long-term school closure is yet to be seen. However a
study by Chen et al. [23] of a one week closure of schools in Taiwan
during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak found that 27% of families could not
go to work with 18% losing income as a direct result. A study by the
Brookings Institution [24], modelling closures in major US cities and
nationwide, suggested that there would be a median cost of $142 per
student per week. This led to an estimate that a four-week closure of
New York City would result in an economic cost of $1.1bn and that a
nationwide closure for 12 weeks would cost 1% of GDP. Furthermore,
this study looks at the direct impact of closures on the children of
healthcare workers with an estimated 6–19% of healthcare workforce
hours lost. An estimate in the UK suggested that protracted closures
could cost 3% of UK GDP [25]. However, Wren-Lewis [26] posits a view
that this impact will be short-lived as its cause is known and defined
and therefore will have a clear endpoint, unlike a normal economic
recession.
COVID-19 has also influenced the tertiary sector. As well as the
impact on undergraduate education [27], the most significant impact is
on the postgraduate research community with research into many non-
COVID related topics being placed on hold. In the United Kingdom, the
national funding body for health research has halted all non-COVID
research in order to allow clinically trained staff who are normally on
academic secondments to return to the frontline [28]. In the United
States, similar action has been taken by the National Institute for Health
to shut down all non-critical research in order to free up staff and re-
sources for ‘mission-critical’ research [29]. Outside of the healthcare
research setting, several institutions have put research in fields such as
the humanities and social sciences on hold with Harvard University
closing all laboratories in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences [30].
Additionally, concerns have been raised regarding the number of
scientific conferences that have been cancelled or postponed [31].
These conferences are the key to scientific research in many disciplines,
allowing dissemination of research as well as providing networking
opportunities for collaboration and job-seeking. Many conferences have
moved online, however these ‘virtual conferences’ are often not as
amenable to networking and informal means of scientific communica-
tion.

4.2. Finance industry
COVID-19 has affected communities, businesses and organisations
globally, inadvertently affecting the financial markets and the global
economy. Uncoordinated governmental responses and lockdowns have
led to a disruption in the supply chain. In China, lockdown restrictions
significantly reduced the production of goods from factories, while
quarantine and self-isolation policies decreased consumption, demand
and utilisation of products and services [32]. As COVID-19 has pro-
gressed to affect the rest of the world, China will begin to recover faster
than the rest of the countries, strengthening its trade negotiating power
against the US. In fact, chinese companies will be in the advantageous
position to acquire their western counterparts, which are greatly de-
pendent and will be inevitably affected by the stock market [15].
In addition to the disruption in the supply chain, the capital market
sector has also been affected. In the US, the S&P 500, a stock market
index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies on
the US stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the
Nasdaq
fell
dramatically
until
the
US
government
secured
the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, with the
indexes raising by 7.3% [33], 7.73% [34] and 7.33% [35] respectively
[36]. Furthermore, 10-year US Treasury bond yields have dropped to
0.67% [37,38]. In the Asian markets, the same pattern followed with
China's Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and South Korea's
KOSPI, initially dropping then followed by a rise in stocks after gov-
ernmental support. Japan's Nikkei was up 2.01% [39]. Europe's bond
yields mostly declined, reaching market stress hit levels faced in the
eurozone crisis of 2011–2012 [40]. Germany's DAX, the UK's FTSE 100
and the Euro Stoxx 50 were all down on March 23rd, but rose sig-
nificantly after the EU's rescue package was agreed. Gold dropped
against the dollar by 0.65% [41].
The decline in global stock markets has festered a volatile en-
vironment with critical liquidity levels [42]. To combat these effects,
Central banks globally have intervened to ensure liquidity is main-
tained and mitigate the economic shock, with several leaders em-
barking on a ‘Whatever it takes’ approach [7,43]. Professor of Financial
Economics, David Miles, from Imperial College London has likened
such government spending to the post-Napoleonic, first and second
world war eras where public sector liabilities rose greatly. He further
explains that bond markets could have difficulties in coping with large
scale government bond issuance and that central banks may have to
intervene by purchasing these bonds on an unprecedented scale [15].
4.2.1. European response
Europe has pledged a €1.7tn rescue package in an attempt to
dampen the economic effects of COVID-19 on the eurozone with con-
tributions from all member states, the UK, as well as countries in the
area which do not for part of the European Union (eg. Switzerland)
[44].
The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a €750bn asset-
purchase programme with an aim of stabilising and strengthening the
Euro through the pandemic. Moreover, the European Commission has
collated a €25bn investment fund for the cause and has agreed to a
more relaxed policy on budget rules to encourage public spending and
the support of affected businesses by their corresponding government
[7].
In Germany, the state development bank (KfW) is to provide €500bn
in loans to aid companies affected by the pandemic, dubbed the ‘biggest
post-war aid package’ [45]. The Kurzarbeitergeld, a subsidised scheme
by the German Federal parliament (the Bundenstag), will look to
compensate employees who fall ill or are unable to work due to the
virus [46,47]. France, Spain and Italy have also promised €345bn,
€200bn and €25bn respectively, to help support businesses [44].
4.2.2. UK response
In the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £330bn package of
emergency loan guarantees to help those in financial difficulty [48,49].
A further £20bn of fiscal support has been issued in attempts to save UK
businesses. The package of measures includes:
• A Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme
• Deferring VAT and Income Tax payments
• A Statutory Sick Pay relief package for SMEs (Small and Medium
sized Enterprises)
• A 12-month business rates holiday for all retail, hospitality, leisure
and nursery businesses in England
• Small business grant funding of £10,000 for all business in receipt of
small business rate relief or rural rate relief
• Grant funding of £25,000 for retail, hospitality and leisure busi-
nesses with property with a rateable value between £15,000 and
£51,000
• The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme offering loans
of up to £5 million for SMEs through the British Business Bank
• A new lending facility from the Bank of England to help support
liquidity among larger firms, helping them bridge coronavirus dis-
ruption to their cash flows through loans
• The HMRC Time To Pay Scheme

The Bank of England has cut interest rates to 0.1 pc, an un-
precedented response, in an attempt to dampen the effects of COVID-19
[50] as well as an attempt to maintain the confidence of unnerved in-
vestors [15].
On the March 20, 2020, the Chancellor announced that the gov-
ernment will pay up to 80% of the salary of staff (up to £2500 per
month) who are kept on by their employer [51] and has vowed to
support approximately 3.8 milion self-employed individuals with a
£9bn support scheme [52].
4.2.3. US response
The US Federal Reserve (the Fed) has recently decreased interest
rates by 0.5% in an attempt to soften the blow of the virus on the US
Economy [53,54]. On March 23rd, the Fed also announced that it
would further aid the market by purchasing $125bn in bonds. It will
also offer a $300bn lending programme for Main Street businesses as
well as ensure that Asset Backed Loan facility which was used in
2008–2009 would be restarted [36]. The Trump administration has
managed to secure on the 27th March [55] a $2 trillion ‘virus-aid
package’- the CARES Act [56], to support the economy through these
times [57]. This bill is to cover:
• $1200 to be given to every adult American with an income less than
$75,000 or couples less than $150,000.
• $500 for every child under the age of 17
• Increase unemployment compensation by $600 per week, increase
unemployment benefit support by 13 months and extend eligibility
to the self-employed and independent contractors
• $500bn in loans and loan guarantees to be issued by the US Treasury
Department to small and large businesses. Businesses who receive
such aid are obligated to keep 90% of their employees until
September 30, must pay their loans back within five years and are
prohibited to issue dividends for up to a year after the full amount of
their loan is repaid.
• $377bn to provide small businesses with loans and grants, $10bn for
emergency grants and $17bn will also be made available to enable
deferral of existing payments.
• Student loan payments to be deferred until 30th September without
penalty charges
• Ban on foreclosures of federally backed mortgages until mid-May
• Ban on evictions of tenants in federal housing programmes for four
months
• $25bn in food assistance
• $100bn for healthcare
• $45bn to be directed to the Disaster Relief Fund (which includes the
supply of protective equipment)
• $29bn in grants and $29bn in loans, loan guarantees, excise and fuel
tax relief
• $17bn towards national security
• $14bn to farmers
4.2.4. China and Japan response
China and Japan took similar action with the People's Bank of China
(PBoC) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) providing the equivalent of $240bn
and $43bn to maintain bank liquidity, respectively [53,58].
Leaders from the G20 (Group of 20) expect recovery from the eco-
nomic crisis to take the form of a ‘V’ shaped curve, with a sharp and
short-lived dip, followed by a rapid recovery and economic growth. Mr
Angel Gurría, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD), disagrees with these claims,
stating that the road to economic recovery is more likely to resemble a
‘U’ shaped curve, with a prolonged period of economic inactivity for
years to come [59].
4.3. Healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry
4.3.1. Healthcare
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented challenge for
healthcare systems worldwide. In particular, the risk to healthcare
workers is one of the greatest vulnerabilities of healthcare systems
worldwide. Considering most healthcare workers are unable to work
remotely, strategies including the early deployment of viral testing for
asymptomatic and/or frontline healthcare staff is imperative [60]. High
healthcare costs, shortages of protective equipment including N95 face
masks, and low numbers of ICU beds and ventilators have ultimately
exposed weaknesses in the delivery of patient care. In the US, there is
concern regarding uninsured individuals, who may work in jobs pre-
disposing them to viral infection which may lead to significant financial
consequences in the event of illness [61].
4.3.2. Pharmaceutical industry
Profound changes to the dynamics of healthcare are likely to ensue,
leading to massive investment into disease prevention infrastructure,
and the accelerated digital transformation of healthcare delivery.
Nicola et al. have highlighted the change in healthcare policy and
clinical management as new evidence emerges [62]. In the US, active
pharmaceutical ingredients are imported largely from India (18%) and
the EU (26%), while China accounts for 13%. China is also the biggest
exporter of medical devices to the US, accounting for 39.3%. Produc-
tion slow-downs and limitations in supply would inadvertently lead to
revenue loss [63]. In the UK, AstraZeneca have indicated that COVID-
19 is likely to affect its 2020 revenue growth.
Conversely, opportunities for companies engaged in vaccine and
drug development have simultaneously emerged, with US-based com-
panies including Johnson & Johnson, Vir Biotechnology, Novavax and
NanoViricides having announced collaborative plans to develop a viral
vaccine. A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational COVID-19
vaccine is currently underway, and will enroll 45 healthy adult vo-
lunteers ages 18–55 years over approximately 6 weeks [64].
4.4. Hospitality, tourism and aviation
4.4.1. Hospitality
The hospitality and travel industry have perhaps been most hard-
hit, with hourly workers facing potentially devastating hardships.
Marriott International (approximately 174,000 employees) is poised to
place tens of thousands of workers on furlough [65]. Hilton Worldwide
has also notified lenders on March 5, 2020 that they would be bor-
rowing a precautionary $1.75bn under a revolving loan to preserve
money and to maintain flexibility “in light of uncertainty in the global
markets” [66].
Hotel industry revenue per available room in the United States fell
11.6% for the week ending March 7, 2020, whilst in China occupancy
rates fell 89% by the end of January 2020. Other United States hotel
companies are seeking approximately $150bn in direct aid for em-
ployees due to an unprecedented fall in demand, along with an esti-
mated $1.5bn loss since mid-February [67]. MGM Resorts International
have also announced a temporary suspension in operation at its Las
Vegas properties, with casino operations closing on 16th March, fol-
lowed by hotel operations [68]. Since March 1, 2020, hotel occupancy
in Germany decreased by over 36% [69]. Italian cities including Rome
have been inadvertently affected with a current occupancy rate of 6%,
whilst London remains the most stable with an occupancy rate of ap-
proximately 47% [69]. Overall, the COVID-19 crisis has led to inter-
national distortions for the hospitality industry, and significant slumps
for the European hotel market.
4.4.2. Tourism
The tourism sector is currently one of the hardest-hit by the out-
break of COVID-19, with impacts on both travel supply and demand. As

a direct consequence of COVID-19, The World Travel and Tourism
Council has warned that 50 million jobs in the global travel and tourism
sector may be at risk [70]. In Europe, the European Tourism Manifesto
alliance, encompassing over 50 European public and private organisa-
tions from the travel and tourism sector, have highlighted the need to
implement urgent measures. These include temporary state aid for the
tourism and travel sector from national governments as well as fast and
easy access to short- and medium-term loans to overcome liquidity
shortages, including funds made available by the EU through the
Corona Response Investment Initiative, and fiscal relief [71]. The alli-
ance has also called for the launch of the European Unemployment
Reinsurance Scheme [72].
Internationally,
Vietnam
received
approximately
1.45
million
Chinese visitors in the first quarter of 2019, dropping by 644,000 in
January of 2020. It is estimated that Vietnam's tourist sector will suffer
a $5bn loss should the COVID-19 pandemic extend into the second
quarter of 2020 [73]. Moreover, the Philippines is projecting a
0.3–0.7% slowdown in the country's full year GDP [74]. In the United
States, restriction of all non-essential travel, US-Canada border closure
[75], and the suspension of visa services [76] may accelerate disruption
of the American economy. In the UK, many parks are now closing to
further enforce social distancing as they have in Italy [77].
4.4.3. Aviation
The travel industry is grappling with an unprecedented wave of
cancellations and a significant drop in demand amid strict govern-
mental instructions to implement social distancing and the restriction of
unnecessary travel. Globally, border closures are on the rise. In the US,
all foreign nationals from China, Iran and certain EU countries are
barred from entering [78]. This ban includes anyone who visited these
countries within the 14 days prior to their US trip. The UK Foreign
Office has also advised UK nationals against all but essential interna-
tional travel [79]. In Europe, the president of the EU commission has
proposed all non-essential travel from outside the EU be suspended for
30 days. Travel suspensions have also been implemented across Asia
and Africa [80].
In light of these events, Malaysia Airport reported a 30% decline in
international passenger traffic for February [81]. More recently, Air-
lines for America sought a government bailout encompassing $25bn in
grants, $25bn in loans, and significant tax relief to ensure survival [82].
UK airlines have also called for an immediate £7.5bn emergency bailout
to prevent a widespread shutdown [83]. Ministers in the Netherlands
have also reported implementing strategies to ensure the continued
operation of Air France-KLM and Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, whilst
the Italian Government have been said to be close to taking full control
of ailing airline Alitalia.
4.5. Real estate and housing sector
The real estate industry is facing great uncertainty due to COVID-19.
At an individual level, social distancing precautions have reduced house
views, a key part of the selling process, and both buyers and sellers are
having to reconsider their plans. Increasingly, sellers are looking for
reassurance regarding the health of potential buyers coming to view
properties [84]. Some brokers are offering house tours via Skype and
FaceTime to minimise the risk of infection propagation. Brokers around
the United States are also asking potential buyers to preregister for
viewings in order to gauge their level of interest and likelihood of
purchase [85].
Additionally, thousands of workers around the world have been
made redundant or have been placed on temporary, unpaid leave of
absence. Inevitably this will have a significant impact on individuals’
abilities to pay rent, mortgages and various household expenditures. To
tackle this, part of the £350bn lifeline the United Kingdom (UK) gov-
ernment has released will be used to allow mortgage lenders to offer a
three-month mortgage holiday to those in financial difficulty [49]. The
government has also recommended that buyers and lenders delay ne-
gotiations during the lockdown, bringing transactions to a halt [86].
Many are worried that we will face another financial crisis, similar to
that of 2008 that will impact confidence in real estate. Banks within the
UK have begun to take precautions; high street lenders require up to
40% deposits for a new mortgage to be approved. It is however too
early to speculate on the impact of COVID-19; as of yet, the infection
has not had a significant impact on the housing market [87,88].
4.6. Sports industry
COVID-19 is having a substantial impact on sporting schedules as
some of the world's largest sporting events come to view in 2020.
Football's much anticipated Euro 2020 tournament has been postponed
for 12 months while play-offs have been postponed till June 2020 at the
earliest [89]. The international Olympic committee was committed to
staging the Tokyo 2020 Olympics this summer without delay. However,
they have now made the decision to postpone the games to 2021, a
decision that is supported by athletes and their respective nations
[89–91]. In a similar vein, the Australian Formula one Grand Prix has
been postponed with Bahrain and Vietnam opting to cancel their fix-
tures until further notice [89]. These are but a few examples; golf,
tennis, athletics, basketball, rugby, cycling, boxing, snooker and ice-
skating fixtures have all faced cancellations and delays in an attempt to
curb the spread of disease. Inevitably this will have a significant fi-
nancial burden, the gravity of which has yet to come to light [89].
4.7. Information technology, media, research & development
With the WHO raising COVD-19's status to a pandemic, 35 compa-
nies and academic institutions are racing to develop an effective vac-
cine. Four potential vaccines are currently being tested on animals with
the biotech firm Moderna entering human trials imminently [92]. The
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), is leading
various efforts to finance and coordinate COVID-19 vaccine develop-
ment [92]. They have announced a $4.4m partnership fund with No-
vavax and University of Oxford to develop a viable solution [92]. The
Gates Foundation, Wellcome and Mastercard have also committed
$125m to find new treatments for COVID-19 [93].
Social distancing precautions are paramount to the containment
effort. Additionally, COVID-19 has left several hospitals in turmoil,
having reached maximal capacity. As a result, various countries are
turning towards technological solutions, to care for patients and at the
same time, minimise the risk of person to person transmission. In var-
ious cities across China, tele-response bots powered by fifth-generation
wireless networks are being utilised that allow health care staff to
communicate with patients, monitor their health and deliver medical
supplies [94]. Drones that deliver medication and work-from-home
apps are also being adopted. Automation of services has been a major
goal for China. COVID-19 has helped to accelerate uptake and has taken
them one step closer to this goal [94].
The demand for respiratory ventilators has skyrocketed due to the
outbreak of COVID-19. However, it is clear that the current supply
across the United States and Europe does not meet demand. It is esti-
mated that the USA has 160,000 ventilators [95]. This is 580,000 short
of what would be required in a severe pandemic [95]. Governments
around the world are attempting to buy ventilators. In the United
Kingdom, the prime minister has asked companies such as Rolls Royce
and Dyson to divert their manufacturing power to medical supplies
[95]. However, industry leaders have stated that this is easier said than
done as many of these companies do not produce medical equipment
such as ventilators. In addition to this, production of ventilators re-
quires strict regulation and testing to ensure their safety which can be a
lengthy process [95].

4.8. Food sector
The food sector, including food distribution and retailing, has been
put under strain as a result of people panic-buying and stockpiling food
[96]. This has led to increased concerns about shortages of food pro-
ducts such as long-life milk, pasta, rice and tinned vegetables. Panic-
buying has resulted in an increase of £1bn worth of food in UK homes
[97]. This high demand on food products has also affected online food
delivery. Companies are struggling with excessive bookings, with de-
liveries arriving late or not at all [98]. Moreover, food banks have also
been affected by panic-buying and food stockpiling as donations have
reduced. Concerns about food running out also means that vulnerable
populations who can not afford to stockpile, may not find food
[99,100].
In response to these concerns, the UK government has made efforts
to provide certain populations with food parcels and free meals to
collect and take home. These populations include high-risk vulnerable
individuals such as the elderly who have no support network, and
school children of low-income families [101–103].
The UK government has also reduced restrictions on delivery hours
for retailers in order to allow stores to restock with basic food products.
Furthermore, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has reassured the
public that despite low inventory of certain food products in local
stores, there are no such shortages of food. Similar statements have
been made by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [104,105].
In addition, despite reassurance by the government, stores have
made drastic changes by restricting the amount of each product that an
individual can buy, providing more than 30,000 new jobs to meet the
high pressure of restocking shelves, and setting special shopping hours
for the elderly, vulnerable populations and NHS stuff. Further changes
being implemented include a decrease in the range of products being
made by manufacturers, with the aim of focusing on products that are
in greater need [106].
Independent supermarkets have also been affected by the high de-
mand on food products. Measures implemented by these local stores
include free delivery of food products to customers to avoid panic-
buying, putting restrictions on the number of customers allowed in at
any given time to avoid overcrowding, and expanding on the number of
suppliers whom they buy their products from to avoid food shortage
[107].
Although supermarkets have seen a huge demand on food products,
restaurants and cafes have been forced to close. As a result, many of
these stores are at risk of permanent closure and many of their em-
ployees have lost their jobs. The impact of COVID-19 on the food in-
dustry has forced Leon, a UK fast-food chain, to change its business
model; 65 of its restaurants were said to turn into shops that sell re-
frigerated ready -meal-type plastic pouches [108].
5. Social impact
5.1. Family dynamics: domestic violence & home video-gaming
Lockdown and social distancing measures to prevent spread of
COVID-19 have heightened fears of increasing levels of domestic vio-
lence, which includes physical, emotional and sexual abuse [109].
Refuge, one of the UK's domestic abuse charities, has reported a
25% increase in calls made to its helpline since lockdown measures
were announced [110].
The concentrated time spent in lockdown means that vulnerable
people are more exposed to abuse and it is more difficult for them to
seek help. In response to increasing concern, the UK government has
published guidelines on how to recognise domestic abuse, how to report
it and where, with a list of all the services available [111].
In addition, a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has
been seen within the video-gaming industry. With many individuals
self-isolating
and/or
remaining
home
under
strict
governmental
regulations, online gaming has seen the emergence of record numbers
of players, which has facilitated a boost in revenue for many companies
[112]. Conversely, negative impacts include cancellation of the annual
and major trade event E3 2020, alongside the rescheduling and/or
cancellation of popular Esport leagues [113].
6. Conclusion
With fears of a new recession and financial collapse, times like these
call for resilient and strong leadership in healthcare, business, gov-
ernment and wider society. Immediate relief measures need to be im-
plemented and adjusted for those that may fall through the cracks.
Medium and longer term planning is needed to re-balance and re-en-
ergise the economy following this crisis. A broad socioeconomic de-
velopment plan including sector by sector plans and an ecosystem that
encourages entrepreneurship is also needed so that those with robust
and sustainable business models can flourish. It is prudent that gov-
ernments and financial institutions constantly re-assess and re-evaluate
the state of play and ensure that the ‘whatever it takes’ promise is truly
delivered.
