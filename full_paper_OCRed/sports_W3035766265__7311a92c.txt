The worldwide spread of COVID-19 has upset the normality of Italian daily life, forcing population to social
distancing and self-isolation. Since the containment precautions also concern sport-related activities, home
workout remained the only possibility to play sports and stay active during the pandemic.
The present study aimed to examine changes in the physical activity levels during self-quarantine in Italy, and
the impact of exercise on psychological health.
A total of 2974 Italian subjects has completed an online survey, but only 2524 subjects resulted eligible for this
study. The questionnaire measured the total weekly physical activity energy expenditure before and during
quarantine (i.e. the sum of walking, moderate-intensity physical activities, and vigorous-intensity physical ac-
tivities) in Metabolic Equivalent Task minutes per week (MET–min/wk) using an adapted version of International
Physical Activity Questionnaire and their psychological well-being using the Psychological General Well Being
Index. Of the 2524 Italian subjects included in the study, 1426 were females (56.4%) and 1098 males (43.6%).
Total physical activity signiﬁcantly decreased between before and during COVID-19 pandemic (Mean: 2429 vs.
1577 MET–min/wk, ****p < 0.0001), in all age groups and especially in men (Female, mean: 1994 vs. 1443
MET–min/wk, ****p < 0.0001; Male, mean: 2998 vs. 1754 MET–min/wk, ****p < 0.0001). Furthermore, a
signiﬁcant positive correlation was found between the variation of physical activity and mental well-being (r ¼
0.07541, ***p ¼ 0.0002), suggesting that the reduction of total physical activity had a profoundly negative
impact on psychological health and well-being of population.
Based on this scientiﬁc evidence, maintaining a regular exercise routine is a key strategy for physical and
mental health during a forced rest period like the current coronavirus emergency.
1. Introduction
In late December 2019, an epidemic of cases with unknown low
respiratory infections occurred in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area
in China's Hubei province. This disease was caused by a new coronavirus
(CoV) named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2), responsible of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as
announced by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020.
In the following weeks, infections spread across China and other coun-
tries, including Italy, and COVID-19 epidemic has become a global health
threat. In Italy, according to last updated of the Italian Ministry of Health
(May 1, 2020 at 6.00 pm) it has been turned out 17.569 patients with
symptoms, 1.578 intensive care, 81.769 home isolation, 100.943 total
currently positive, 78.249 dismissed/healed, 28.236 deaths, 207.428
total cases [1]. Total infected and total death by Italian regions is dis-
played in Table 1. The Italian patients' median age was 62 years, the

median age of fatalities is 80.5 years old, whereas few cases of COVID-19
have been found in very young people [1]. As indicated by Wu and co-
authors [2], the rate of death drastically increased in patients already
affected by one or more pathologies, such as diabetes and cardiovascular
disease. Understanding the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is
important, although they are nonspeciﬁc and ranging from asymptomatic
infection to severe respiratory failure. Common symptoms of COVID-19
comprise fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and dyspnea [3, 4]. The trans-
mission of COVID-19 occurs mainly through droplet and close contact
[5]. Its transmission through oral or conjunctival way is still unknown,
but SARS-CoV-2 has been found in tears, and Lu and coauthors reported
that human conjunctival epithelium could be easily contaminated by
infected droplets or other body ﬂuids [6]. Given powerful trans-
missibility of SARS-CoV-2 by human-to-human, since the outbreak of
COVID-19 in Italy, response efforts by the Italian Government have been
directed to restrain the spread of the virus. A lockdown was imposed on
some northern region on 8 March, and within days, the quarantine was
extended to throughout the peninsula. To ensure social distancing and
limit the movement of the population, schools, public places and busi-
nesses were shutdowns. Moreover, people can move away from their
home only to do essential work (healthcare and social care sectors, police
and armed forces, ﬁreﬁghting, water and electricity supply) or perform
essential activities (health visits, purchasing medicines or food).
Although this strategy has been reported to be efﬁcacy for containing the
COVID-19 outbreak, also the quarantine may be associated with several
undesirable effects, due to alteration of social habits. In particular, pro-
longed self-isolation has a negative impact on the psychological response,
promoting post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anxiety [7].
Moreover, quarantine leads to physical inactivity, which contributes to
adverse health changes such as premature ageing, obesity, cardiovascular
vulnerability, muscle atrophy, bone loss and decreased aerobic capacity
[8]. Literature has largely described the positive role exerted by physical
activity to ameliorate general health, acting on heart, circulatory and
respiratory as well as immune function [9, 10]. Exercise is able to
counteract metabolic disorder, bone, muscle, joint pathologies and
neurodegenerative disease [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Long term
detraining, as for this COVID-19 forced stop, leads to a marked decline of
the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), reduced endurance
capacity, loss of muscle strength and mass, tendon ruptures and reduced
joint tribology [18]. Regular physical activity is a key health behaviour
from a public health perspective, as it has a remarkable impact on health.
In respect to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), caused by patho-
gens like COVID-19, physical activity may ameliorate pathological out-
comes, by promoting the release of stress hormones responsible for
reducing excessive local inﬂammation within the respiratory tract and by
inducing the secretion of anti-inﬂammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 and
IL-10, in order to prevent excessively prolonged T helper type 1 (Th1) cell
population activity against the pathogen, leading to cell damage and
necrosis [19, 20]. Several evidences have also demonstrated that physical
activity can be effective in ameliorating the mental well-being and hav-
ing the potential to prevent symptoms of mental health disorder such as
depression and anxiety [21, 22, 23, 24]. Based on these evidences, the
purpose of this survey study was to examine (1) changes in the physical
activity levels during self-quarantine in Italy; (2) the correlation between
physical activity and well-being of individuals. To this end, it has been
used an online questionnaire containing an adapted version of short-form
of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF), to assess the
practised level of physical activity and Metabolic Equivalents (MET)
energy expenditure, and the Psychological General Well Being Index
(PGWBI) to evaluate psychological and general well-being.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Design
The present study is a quick, large cross-sectional online survey
realized through Google Forms web survey platform (Google LLC,
Mountain View, CA, United States). The online survey was communi-
cated through the social media such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook
and via ofﬁcial channels of the University of Catania, University of
Palermo, University of Perugia and by the Italian Society of Movement
and Sport Sciences (SISMES). Moreover, via WhatsApp and e-mails, it
was shared to personal contacts of the research group members and of the
University students. Before starting the questionnaire, the online survey,
totally anonymous and not traceable to identity of participants, including
a brief description of the study, its aim, and the declarations of

anonymity and conﬁdentiality as follow: “The data of this survey are
anonymous, conﬁdential and their conﬁdentiality will be guaranteed. We
remind you that participation is voluntary and therefore, can withdraw
or renounce at any time. The participant, informed according to the
methods and purposes of the research described above, expresses his/her
consent to his/her participation, having the guarantee that his/her per-
sonal data will be processed anonymously”. All subjects participating in
the online survey gave their informed consent before participation. The
study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Research Center
on Motor Activities (CRAM), University of Catania (Protocol Number:
CRAM-011-2020-16/03/2020), and it was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki.
2.2. Participants
A total of 2974 Italian subjects of different social classes and level of
instruction completed the online Google form questionnaire over a
period of 30 days (from April 1st to April 30th, 2020) during COVID-19
emergency in Italy. To minimize the impact of errors, a cleaning pro-
cess was adopted in order to remove ineligible cases identify meaningless
data, representing invalid questionnaire responses due to the unwill-
ingness of the participant to provide a valid response according to
American Association for Public Opinion Research addressed in “Stan-
dard Deﬁnitions” [25]. Then, the sample comprised 2524 Italian subjects,
1426 females (56.4%) and 1098 males (43.6%), was included in the
study.
2.3. Questionnaire
The online questionnaire (https://forms.gle/8254mc5WfeKs8nDz8)
administered to the participants included ﬁve explanations of the kind of
physical activity and 55 questions comprising demographic, anthropo-
metric, socioeconomic data and health status shown in Table A of sup-
plementary materials, an adapted version of short-form of International
Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF) and the Psychological General
Well Being Index (PGWBI). The questions of IPAQ-SF allowed to assess
physical activity by providing information about the minutes per day or
days per week, at any time of the day, spent doing activities before
COVID-19 emergency and in the last four weeks. Participants reported
the frequency and duration of different types of activity: vigorous (i.e.
heavy lifting, performing intense aerobic exercises, using bike or tread-
mill); moderate (i.e. carrying light loads and bicycling at a regular pace
carry, work out in the garden); walking activities, as well as the average
time, spent sitting on a weekday, including sitting at work. Responses
were converted to Metabolic Equivalent Task minutes per week (MET-
min/week) though automatic scoring of the IPAQ-S [26]. Based on the
IPAQ recommendations for scoring protocol, participants of the study
was classiﬁed in three different groups of physical activity considering
the MET–min/wk of the sum of walking, moderate-intensity physical
activities, and vigorous-intensity physical activities: low active (<600
MET–minutes/week); moderate active (600 MET–minutes/week) and
high active (3000 MET–minutes/week) (http://www.ipaq.ki.se).
To estimate a subjective perception of well-being in the last four
weeks during COVID-19 emergency, the online questionnaire also
comprised 22 items of PGWBI, which evaluate psychological and general
well-being of subjects in six health-related quality of life domains
comprising: anxiety, depressed mood, positive well-being, self-control,
general health and vitality. Each response has six possible scores from
0 (most negative option) to 5 (most positive option), and the global
summary between 0 and 60 reﬂect severe distress, between 61 and 72
reﬂect moderate distress, and between 73 and 110 points to positive
psychological well-being, with a maximum of 110 points, representing
the best achievable level of well-being [27].
2.4. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Instat® Biostatis-
tics version 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA).
Analysis of variance (1way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's
multiple comparisons test) was used for comparison between more than
two groups; Unpaired t test with Welch's correction was used for com-
parison between two groups. p-values of less than 0.05 were considered
to be statistically signiﬁcant (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p
< 0.0001 and ns: not signiﬁcant). Data are presented as the Mean  SEM.
The relationships between physical activity and psychological well-being
were assessed by Pearson correlation analysis.
3. Results
3.1. General characteristics of the study populations
Baseline characteristics of the study subjects are displayed in Table 2.
Overall, the study sample (n ¼ 2524) comprised 56.4% of females and
43.6% of males. Participants were divided into four age groups: young
aged <21 (n ¼ 346); young adult aged 21–40 (n ¼ 1178); adults aged
41–60 (n ¼ 704) and over 60 age (n ¼ 296). The mean height was 171.80
 9.84, the weight 66.10  13.66 kg, and body mass index (BMI) was
22.26  3.52 kg/m2. The BMI was then split into three categories: un-
derweight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9) and overweight
(BMI 25.0). As shown in Table 2, 66.63% of participants were classiﬁed
as normal-weight subjects.
3.2. Comparison of physical activity before and during COVID-19
pandemic in Italy
Participants had to give information (before and during the COVID-19
quarantine) related to vigorous and moderate-intensity physical activity
as well as walking activity and sedentary behaviours. Vigorous-intensity
physical activities comprising heavy lifting, use of home gym machines,
work out/courses on the online platform and others ﬁtness instruments,
demand a hard physical effort that increases the breathing rate more
frequently than normal. Moderate-intensity physical activities can
include carrying a light load or performing aerobic exercises at a modest
intensity. Examination of the total physical activity in MET– minutes/
week demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant difference between before
and during COVID-19 pandemic (Mean: 2429 vs. 1577 MET–min/wk,
****p < 0.0001) (Figure 1A). Speciﬁcally, scores of vigorous physical
activity (Mean: 1109 vs. 766.6 MET–min/wk, ****p < 0.0001), moderate
activity (Mean: 574 vs. 523.3 MET–min/wk, *p ¼ 0.0188) and walking
(Mean: 746 vs. 287.6 MET–min/wk, ****p < 0.0001) of subjects during
COVID-19 emergency were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the period
before quarantine (Figure 1A).
Results of the IPAQ scoring showed that before COVID-19 emergency
23.06% of participants are low active (<600 MET–minutes/week),
35.18% are moderate active (600 MET–minutes/week) and 41.76% are
high active (3000 MET–minutes/week).
During COVID-19 quarantine, percentage of low active individuals
increased up to 39.62%, whereas 29.75% and 30.63% were moderate
active and high active, respectively (Table 3).
As shown in Figure 1B, the levels of physical activity of participants
classiﬁed before COVID-19 as high active and moderate active, drasti-
cally decreased during COVID-19 pandemic (Mean: 4400 vs. 2432
MET–min/wk, ****p < 0.0001; Mean: 1354 vs. 1077 MET–min/wk,
****p < 0.0001, respectively). These results suggest that the limitations
imposed by quarantine, have induced that part of population that usually
performed moderate and high levels of physical activity to decrease their
regular and habitual level during the forced period. On the contrary,

individuals classiﬁed before COVID-19 as low active signiﬁcantly
increased total weekly physical activity energy expenditure during
quarantine (Mean: 408.1 vs 755.3 MET–min/wk, ****p < 0.0001). This
unexpected result could be due to the greater housework activities car-
ried out by these subjects forced to stay at homes, compared to before
quarantine. Accordingly, the variation of MET–min/week (i.e. during vs
before) is positive only in the low group. Moreover, Δ-MET values are
statistically different among the three groups (****p < 0.0001)
(Figure 1C).
Regarding gender classiﬁcations, total physical activity between
before and during quarantine signiﬁcantly decreased in MET–min/week
in both groups (Female, mean: 1994 vs. 1443 MET–min/wk, ****p <
0.0001; Male, mean: 2998 vs. 1754 MET–min/wk, ****p < 0.0001)

(Figure 2A). Moreover, the male group showed highly signiﬁcant varia-
tion of Δ-MET as compared to females (****p < 0.0001) (Figure 2B).
Based on the age classiﬁcations, total physical activity signiﬁcantly
decreased during quarantine in young, young adult, adult and over 60
participants (Mean: 2726 vs. 1852 MET–min/wk, ****p < 0.0001; Mean:
2535 vs. 1664 MET–min/wk, ****p < 0.0001; Mean: 2150 vs. 1339
MET–min/wk, ****p < 0.0001; Mean: 2316 vs. 1473 MET–min/wk,
****p < 0.0001, respectively) (Figure 2C). Instead, no signiﬁcant dif-
ference in Δ-MET–min/week was found among these groups (Figure 2D).
3.3. Correlation between physical activity and psychological well-being
during COVID-19 emergency in Italy
PGWBI scores of six health domains comprising anxiety, depressed
mood, positive well-being, self-control, general health and vitality of
participants divided by gender, age, and levels of physical activity are
displayed in Table 4. The total score of female and low active groups
reﬂected moderate distress, whereas the other groups belong to positive
psychological well-being.
To evaluate if changes in physical activity levels during the COVID-19
emergency affect psychological well-being, a Spearman's ρ correlation
was run to determine the relation between Δ-MET–min/week and total
PGWBI score. As shown in Figure 3A, a signiﬁcant positive correlation
was found between the variation of physical activity and mental well-
being, suggesting that reduction of total physical activity is related to
worse status of psychological well-being (r ¼ 0.07541, ***p ¼ 0.0002).
Interestingly, the correlation between physical activity and psycho-
logical well-being depending on gender showed a higher positive cor-
relation in female (r ¼ 0.1758, ****p < 0.0001) as compared to male
group (r ¼ 0.06356, *p ¼ 0.0366), suggesting that variations in physical
activity habits could more inﬂuence the psychological status of women
than men (Figure 3B-C).
As shown in Figure 3E, a signiﬁcant positive correlation was detected
between the variation of total activity and PGWBI score in young adult
group (r ¼ 0.1168, ****p < 0.0001), whereas no signiﬁcant association
was found between physical activity and psychological well-being in the
other age groups (Figure 3D-G).
Lastly, the same correlation was evaluated for the three categories of
participants, classiﬁed before COVID-19, as high active, moderate active
and low active. As shown in Figure 3H-I, a signiﬁcant correlation was
found in high active (r ¼ 0.1322, ****p < 0.0001) and moderate active (r
¼ 0.1035, **p ¼ 0.0020) groups. No positive correlation between vari-
ation of total activity and PGWBI score was found in low active group
(Figure 3L) (r ¼ 0.08157, p ¼ 0.0546).

4. Discussion
The worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection led the Italian
Government to apply unprecedented containment measures. The Decree
of the Italian Prime Minister of March 20, 2020 has been issued to state
an absolute ban to get away from their home, except to make essential
work or activities. Quarantine has upset the normality of Italian daily life,
forcing population to social distancing and self-isolation. The precau-
tionary measures have also involved sport-related activities, including
walking and running outside. Therefore, home workout remained the
only possibility to play sports and stay active during Covid-19 pandemic.
In the present work, we analyzed the total MET–min/wk before- and
during COVID-19 quarantine and assess the relationship with the psy-
chological well-being of 2524 participants, of which 41.76% was clas-
siﬁed as a highly active group. Certainly, our study sample is very limited
as compared to other work present in the current literature, such as the
work by Jin and coauthors which included more than 500000 in-
dividuals, even if the treated topic was different [28]. To date, in Italy is
not present a national health monitoring and surveillance system for
physical activity, and no studies have collected large data showing the
different activity levels of the general public [29]. However, data for the
years 2010–2013 from the survey by the Italian Ministry of Health's
Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (Progressi delle Aziende
Sanitarie per la Salute in Italia (PASSI)) [30], showed that 36% of Italian
adults of 30–60 years and 24% of older adults of aged 60 þ years meet
the recommended physical activity levels. Moreover, in line with our
results, a very recent study conducted on Sicilian population [31],
showed that before COVID-19 quarantine, 44% and 50% of participants
were moderate active and high active, respectively. Although the scien-
tiﬁc community has highlighted the real beneﬁts to stay active during the
pandemic, our results showed a strong reduction of physical activity
levels, especially for vigorous activity and walking. These data reﬂect the
major difﬁculties to walk and perform an intense exercise at home,
compared to moderate activity. The WHO recommends practising at least
150 min per week of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity or
75 min of high intensity per week, or a combination of both [29, 32].
Although running, fast swimming, playing basketball, soccer, represent
vigorous-intensity activities burn more than 3000 MET–minutes/week,
many other intense exercises can be performed staying at home, such as
carrying/moving heavy load (>20 kg) or stair walking. Stairs can be
found in most private homes, and stair climbing (at least 10 min per day)
is considered a vigorous-intensity activity [33]. An opposite trend was
found for subjects classiﬁed as low active before COVID-19, whose total
physical activity energy expenditure during quarantine signiﬁcantly
increased. This phenomenon could be due to a radical change in
everyday schedules and habits. People remaining at home spend much
more time in low-intensity activities like housework (cooking, washing
dishes or gardening). Another reason could be the greater female pres-
ence in the study that is generally more prone to do low-intensity ac-
tivities. Our study also showed that during the pandemic, the physical
activity levels signiﬁcantly decreased in all age groups considered.
Moreover, the male group showed highly signiﬁcant variation between
before and during COVID-19 emergency as compared to the female
group. Previous works have largely indicated gender differences in ex-
ercise habits and motivations for exercise [34, 35, 36, 37]. Men practice
physical activity mainly for social and competitive reasons. Moreover,
they prefer to practice sports, outdoor and/or in public places like the
gym and ﬁtness clubs. Females are more inclined to exercise in
home-setting, practising aerobics, dancing, yoga, pilates or circuits with
push-ups, squats, planks and jumping jacks. Furthermore, the lower
variation in physical activity levels between before and during quaran-
tine found in women is possibly explained by the higher amount of
housework physical activity than males [37, 38]. Secondly, we investi-
gated the impact of physical activity on psychological well-being during
the pandemic. Our results showed that the reduction of physical activity
levels is ever related to the worse status of psychological well-being. The
positive effects of regular physical activity on psychological health are
indisputable in the ﬁeld of modern medicine. Regular exercise improves
one's self-esteem and a sense of well-being. Individuals who exercise
regularly exhibit fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus support-
ing the concept that physical activity provides a beneﬁcial effect against
the development of mental disorders [39]. Several studies have demon-
strated that the anxiolytic effects of regular exercise are linked to change
in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and mediation of the

endogenous opioid system, which are involved in stress reactivity, anx-
iety, mood and emotional responses [40, 41, 42]. Furthermore, physical
activity is implicated in the modulation of different trophic factors, such
as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF, whose levels are
upregulated following exercise, represents the most abundant neuro-
trophin in the brain, which positively inﬂuences both anxiety and
depressive disorders [43]. We found that the correlation between the
reduction of physical activity and psychological well-being is stronger in
the female group. Previous studies have examined gender differences
between measures of physical ﬁtness and life satisfaction, that is one of
the central constructs in the ﬁeld of positive psychology. Although most
of them reﬂecting no difference between genders and life satisfaction,
some works demonstrated higher life satisfaction measures among fe-
males when compared with males. This evidence suggests that reduction
of physical activity levels may mostly inﬂuence mental well-being of
female group [44, 45, 46, 47]. The current study also showed a signiﬁ-
cant correlation between the change in total activity and the PGWBI
score in subjects classiﬁed as high active and moderate active as well as
in the young adult group. The latter result is supported by previous
studies demonstrating the strong relationship between physical activity
and psychological well-being in this age group [47, 48, 49].
Although the negative impact on psychological well-being due to the
reduction of physical activity levels is a dogma, currently in the literature
there is only one study conducted in Canada that can strengthen our
present results, regarding the worsen of psychophysical conditions dur-
ing a period of forced rest due to a pandemic [50]. Generally, it is the
individual to choose if perform or not physical activity, but the COVID-19
spread changed the world. Gyms, stadiums, pools, dance and ﬁtness
studios, physiotherapy centres, parks and playgrounds were closed,
compelling people to ﬁnd alternatives to exercise. Consequently,
different life habits have been affected, with the modiﬁcation of routines
of mobility, physical activity, and habitual exercise protocols. Under such
unusual conditions, barriers to keep an active life's style were hard to
overcome. For the above reasons, we studied the impact of physical ac-
tivity on psychological health during Covid-19 pandemic in Italy. The
beneﬁts of exercise are proven very helpful, especially in times of anxi-
ety, crisis and fear. There are concerns therefore that, in the context of the
pandemic, lack of access to regular sporting or exercise routines resulted
in challenges to the immune system, physical health, including by lead-
ing to the commencement of or exacerbating existing diseases that have
their roots in a sedentary lifestyle. Lack of access to exercise and physical
activity had also mental health impacts, compound stress or anxiety that
many experienced in the face of isolation from normal social life. Possible
loss of family or friends from the virus and impact of the virus on one's
economic well-being and access to nutrition exacerbated these effects.
The limitations of this study included the over-reporting bias of
physical activity as well as to report at the same time point, information
related to exercise levels before- and during COVID-19. However, IPAQ
questionnaires may supply a reliable approximation of physical activity
at a population level, and its validity has been conﬁrmed in different
studies [51, 52].
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, our results, for the ﬁrst time in the literature, have
shown that quarantine in Italy induces a signiﬁcant reduction of total
weekly physical activity energy expenditure in all age groups and espe-
cially in men, and this reduction negatively affects the psychological
well-being.
In fact, physical activity has a profoundly positive impact on psy-
chological health, by enhancing self-esteem and resilience to stress and
reducing depression and anxiety. Given the spread of COVID-19, stay at
home is a fundamental step to halt the pandemic. However, the clinical
relevance of the present study denotes that maintaining regular physical
activity is an important preventive strategy for physical and mental
health during a forced rest period like the current coronavirus emer-
gency. Then “stay active to feel better”.
