The COVID-19 pandemic has been labeled as a black swan event that caused a ripple eﬀect on every aspect of
human life. Despite the short time span of the pandemic—only four and half months so far—a rather large
volume of research pertaining to COVID-19 has been published (107 articles indexed in Scopus and the Web of
Science). This article presents the ﬁndings of a bibliometric study of COVID-19 literature in the business and
management domain to identify current areas of research and propose a way forward. The analysis of the
published literature identiﬁed four main research themes and 18 sub-themes. The ﬁndings and propositions of
this study suggest that COVID-19 will be the catalyst of several long- and short-term policy changes and requires
the theoretical and empirical attention of researchers. The oﬀered propositions will act as a roadmap to potential
research opportunities.
1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a human social and eco-
nomic crisis that has attacked the core of human existence. It continues
to spread uncontrollably around the world; as of May 11, 2020,
2,403,888 people had been infected globally (WHO, 2020). The out-
break is predicted to reach its peak in June 2020, declining only from
July 2020 onwards (WHO, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has aﬀected
all segments of the population, especially vulnerable groups such as the
old, the inﬁrm, the disabled, the marginalized and the poverty-stricken
(Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020). In response to the pandemic outbreak,
the leaders of many countries decided to save lives before saving the
economy, declaring sudden or phased lockdowns in their countries.
Policies like “social distancing” and “stay-at-home” were implemented
overnight, which severely damaged several businesses across industries
(Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020; Leite, Hodgkinson, & Gruber, 2020).
According to the World Trade Organization (WTO, 2020), world
trade was already experienced a slump in 2019, and then the COVID-19
pandemic precipitated a global ﬁnancial crisis. Early estimates have
predicted that major economies will lose around 2.4 to 3.0 percent of
their gross domestic product (GDP) during 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic (WTO, 2020). It is becoming challenging for most businesses
across the world to keep their ﬁnancial wheels rolling, given reduced
revenues and the high level of uncertainty. It is thus of the utmost
importance for businesses to conduct proper assessment and feasibility
analyses of their business models (Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020).
COVID-19 has also pushed businesses across the world to rapidly
operate in newer and more resilient ways. As ﬁrms change their prio-
rities in response to old challenges like real-time decision-making,
workforce productivity, business continuity, and security risks, newer
challenges introduced by the pandemic are testing businesses’ resilience
as they attempt to lay a foundation for the future (Ivanov, 2020). To
help business practitioners and researchers understand the impact of
the pandemic on future economic growth, this study analyzed a corpus
of COVID-19 and business and management articles to address ques-
tions like the following: What are the growth trajectories and trends of
publications in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak?
What are the topical foci for research regarding COVID-19 and busi-
nesses? This review captures the current state of research about COVID-
19 through a systematic literature review and develops propositions to
guide future research. It can be described as a prescriptive study that
reviews 107 articles pertaining to COVID-19 and aims to provide a
reference point for practitioners and researchers alike. The paper in-
cludes sections delineating the methodology, results, discussion, con-
clusion, and future research avenues.

2. Methodology
Bibliometric analysis is an expedient approach to examine the
evolution of research domains, including topics and authors, based on
the disciplines’ social, intellectual, and conceptual structures (Donthu,
Kumar, & Pattnaik, 2020). Researchers have used this technique in a
range of disciplines, like strategic management (Ferreira, Fernandes, &
Ratten, 2016), corporate social responsibility (Bhattacharyya & Verma,
2020), medicine (Liao et al., 2018), and corporate universities (Singh,
Verma, & Chaurasia, 2020).
Although a few recent bibliometric studies have addressed the im-
pact of COVID-19 (Chahrour et al., 2020; Hossain, 2020; Park, Cook,
Lim, Sun, & Dickens, 2020), each study has its own set of limitations.
Chahrour et al. (2020) only examined the most inﬂuential observational
studies and therapeutic trials described in articles published in the
PubMed and World Health Organization (WHO) databases. Also, they
did not study the intellectual structure of the research area. The bib-
liometric analysis performed by Park et al. (2020) included only the
PubMed database and the therapeutic aspects of the pandemic. Hossain
(2020) collated articles published only in the Web of Science (WoS)
database and reported that researchers largely targeted biological to-
pics, such as those related to genetics, epidemiology, and zoonosis.
Importantly, Hossain (2020) pointed out the necessity of extending the
COVID-19 pandemic-related research to the ﬁeld of socioeconomics.
To overcome the limitations of these earlier works, this study uti-
lized the science mapping approach to understand the topical foci of the
ﬁeld of COVID-19 and business research (Fig. 1). The science mapping
approach helps researchers to understand the extent of a topic, its
emergent trends, and its evolution over time (Singh et al., 2020). It is a
holistic approach that provides better insights than a traditional lit-
erature review because it minimizes the potential subjectivity of the
researcher (Bhattacharyya & Verma, 2020). This bibliometric study is
novel in several respects. First, it applied the science mapping approach
(consisting of bibliometric literature and scientometric analyses) in the
emerging research domain of COVID-19 and business to minimize
subjectivity and bias. Second, the research extended the science map-
ping approach with an in-depth analysis of the identiﬁed research
themes. Third, it analyzed the research topics, identiﬁed signiﬁcant
research gaps, and provided future avenues in the research domain of
COVID-19 and business.
To address the research questions of this study, we identiﬁed several
research articles published within the business and management ﬁeld.
Fig. 1 summarizes the research design. The publications was obtained
using the Scopus and WoS databases. Data acquisition from existing
literature is crucial in the science mapping approach since it determines
the dataset of articles from which pertinent conclusions will be drawn
(Singh et al., 2020). We selected both the Scopus and WoS databases to
ensure a wider range of high-quality peer-reviewed journals in the
domain of business and management compared to EBSCO, Google
Scholar, or others (Ferreira et al., 2016). We retrieved existing litera-
ture related to COVID-19 in the business management domain from the
Scopus and WoS databases using keywords related to COVID-19
(Hossain, 2020): “2019-nCoV” OR “COVID-19” OR “Coronavirus Dis-
ease 2019” OR “Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia” OR “NCP” OR “2019

novel coronavirus” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “2019 Novel Coronavirus
Diseases” OR “novel coronavirus” OR “pneumonia.” The keyword
search in Scopus and WoS was set to include titles, abstracts, and
keywords in order to retrieve all relevant publications. The search
period was set to include articles published between January 1, 2020,
and May 11, 2020. Only English-language publications were considered
for the review process.
The initial search yielded over 12,068 papers, but narrowing the
results to only the business research area yielded 142 papers published
in the Scopus and WoS databases. Of these, 35 articles were duplicates
(i.e., indexed in both databases) and thus were excluded from further
analysis (Homrich, Galvao, Abadia, & Carvalho, 2018). A total of 256
diﬀerent researchers published articles between January 1, 2020, and
May 11, 2020, related to COVID-19 in the business and management
domain. The screening process resulted in a unique sample of 107 ar-
ticles published within the set time period from 71 diﬀerent journals,
61 diﬀerent countries, and 272 diﬀerent institutions. Of these, four
researchers had published two Scopus or WoS-indexed articles in
journals like Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation
Review, International Journal of Production Research, Journal of Cleaner
Production, International Journal of Scientiﬁc and Technology Research,
and Journal of Risk and Financial Management. This indicates the
adaptability and openness of researchers across the world to understand
contemporary issues like the impact of COVID-19 on business. Further,
the results indicate that this ﬁeld is still evolving and is in its initial
stage, as there are no dominant authors yet. Also, researchers with
diﬀerent backgrounds have contributed to the ﬁeld.
3. Bibliometric analysis
3.1. Co-word analysis
In order to identify emerging themes related to COVID-19 in the 107
articles identiﬁed in the business research area, we performed a co-
word analysis of keywords using VOSviewer. Co-word analysis applies
text-mining techniques to the titles, abstracts, and keywords of articles
(Van Eck & Waltman, 2010). Co-word links identify multiple keywords
that occur together in the same articles. The relationship between
keywords is determined based on the number of articles in which the
keywords occur together (Van Eck & Waltman, 2010). To perform a co-
word analysis, we combined the datasets retrieved from the Scopus and
WoS databases and converted them into a Microsoft Word ﬁle for data
cleaning and preprocessing. We manually eliminated the duplicate ar-
ticles from the ﬁle and removed coding errors in the sources, aﬃlia-
tions, and cited references for further analysis. For example, we cor-
rected duplication errors such as two diﬀerent forms of the same
author’s name (e.g., “Lee S.” and “Lee S.J.”) through the data cleaning
process. Further, we standardized keywords to ensure uniﬁcation and
consistency (i.e., singular/plural). After data cleaning, we conducted
data analysis to understand the evolution of the corpus of COVID-19
literature in the business and management domain during 2020 using
BibExcel and VOSviewer. BibExcel is a data analysis tool used for de-
scriptive analysis of data (Ferreira et al., 2016). We used it in this study
because of its high ﬂexibility for data modiﬁcation in databases like
WoS and Scopus. Further, we employed the visualization tool VOS-
viewer, which collected all the keywords from the dataset and created a
co-word network. This network helped us to understand the research
interests and relationships among keywords. It was from this analysis
that the prominent research themes emerged. The study identiﬁed 4
themes and 18 sub-themes (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Each theme and sub-
theme is discussed in detail in the ﬁndings and discussion section.
4. Findings and discussion
In comparison with the 2008 global ﬁnancial crisis, the COVID-19
pandemic is associated with several new challenges, given that major
economic activities have been stiﬂed. The extent of COVID-19 spread
across the world has heightened uncertainty regarding consumption
and investment among diﬀerent stakeholders, like consumers, trade
partners, suppliers, and investors (Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020). In-
creasing the length of the lockdown and travel restrictions (national
and international) are severely aﬀecting the general economy. The
COVID-19 crisis is generating spillover eﬀects throughout global and
regional supply chains, disrupting demand and supply (Pantano, Pizzi,
Scarpi, & Dennis, 2020). Additionally, social distancing policies have
almost destroyed service industries, like travel and tourism and hospi-
tality, which could trigger a recession (Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020).
The severe global challenges posed by COVID-19 can be tackled using a
range of digital technologies, like the Internet of things, artiﬁcial in-
telligence, big data analytics, and drones (Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020).
This study tried to examine the impact of COVID-19 on diﬀerent facets
of businesses through bibliometric analysis and identiﬁed four major
discourses (Table 1) including impact of COVID-19 on overall business,
technologies, supply chain management, and the service industry.
4.1. Cluster 1: Overall impact of COVID-19 on business
4.1.1. Cluster 1a: Impact of COVID-19 on business
The COVID-19 pandemic has already had dramatic, rippling eﬀects
across global economic activities in every region of the world (Boﬁnger
et al., 2020). In order to ﬂatten the curve of infection rates, several
countries across the world have imposed widespread restrictions (e.g.,
lockdowns, quarantines, and closure of physical shops and businesses)
to protect the functioning of healthcare systems (Michie, 2020). Un-
derstandably, these closures have had an immense, immediate impact
on the economic activity in almost every sector. For example, activities
involving direct contact between consumers and service providers have
been adversely aﬀected by restrictions on movement and social dis-
tancing (Giritli Nygren & Olofsson, 2020). The closure of the economy
has also increased the risks associated with investments by households
and businesses. Many companies are either facing bankruptcy or re-
ducing their production capacity, which has led to higher unemploy-
ment and underemployment (Boﬁnger et al., 2020). A prolonged
lockdown period also increases the risk of a massive increase in cor-
porate and governmental debts, leading to fundamental ﬁnancial im-
balances that could prolong the recovery period from the COVID-19
crisis (Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020).
4.1.2. Cluster 1b: Impact of COVID-19 on the value chain
During the COVID-19 crisis, businesses are working faster to ensure
a
competitive
advantage
(Lee,
Venkataraman,
Heim,
Roth,
&
Chilingerian, 2020). In order to solve emerging problems, ﬁrms are
embracing methods and processes that are responsive rather than re-
active to the crisis (Chesbrough, in press), and they are switching to
new operating models focused on the customer and supported by the
right governance (Graves & Karabayeva, 2020; Lee et al., 2020). They
are quicker to decide where to invest and reallocate their resources. In
addition, ﬁrms are pushed to create new product/services and radically
adapt in order to remain visible, agile, and productive (Chesbrough, in
press; Kim, 2020).
4.1.3. Cluster 1c: COVID-19 & start-ups
The COVID-19 crisis has seriously threatened the potential for in-
novation and discouraged start-ups that could have been viable under
normal circumstances (Kuckertz et al., 2020). A high percentage of
start-ups are poised to go out of business in a few months as the capital
and revenue required to sustain them are quickly drying up (Boﬁnger
et al., 2020). Therefore, until the COVID-19 pandemic is over, survival
must be the primary focus of start-ups and regulators. Further, the crisis
has brought about a change in the investment patterns of venture ca-
pital ﬁrms, which are shifting their focus to start-ups operating in
sectors like online grocery delivery, healthcare, fast-moving consumer

goods, and home entertainment. (Kuckertz et al., 2020). The creativity
and experimentation of start-ups is highly dependent on intense per-
sonal and social exchanges between stakeholders. The pandemic-in-
duced lockdown has reduced the opportunities for direct communica-
tion and spontaneous encounters, resulting in deleterious impacts on
start-ups’ growth curves (Boﬁnger et al., 2020).
4.1.4. Cluster 1d: Impact of COVID-19 on trade
According to the WTO (2020), trade in 2020 will plunge by −13%
or −32% according to the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, re-
spectively. Further, the recovery in 2021 is uncertain and will depend
on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the eﬀectiveness of
policy responses (Evenett, 2020). Despite the closure of international
borders, maintaining trade ﬂow is crucial to ensure access to essential
goods like medicine and food in addition to supporting jobs and eco-
nomic activities (Ozili & Arun, 2020). COVID-19 is severely aﬀecting
service trades, threatening permanent closure (Garvey & Carnovale,
2020). However, some service trades, like information technology

services, are booming because employees are able to work from home
(Evenett, 2020).
4.1.5. Cluster 1e: Impact of COVID-19 on employment
The COVID-19 crisis has aﬀected around 3.3 billion employees
(Monitor, 2020). People across the world are unable to work because
they are being asked to isolate or quarantine themselves. Due to COVID-
19 lockdowns, businesses have increased layoﬀs and working hours and
reduced wages (Dey & Loewenstein, 2020). Many employees have been
aﬀected by low wages, or loss of income. Sectors like travel and
tourism, food services, retail, manufacturing, and business and ad-
ministrative activities are at the highest risk of unemployment and
under-employment (Bell & Blanchﬂower, 2020). COVID-19 is dis-
rupting the economies of many countries by reducing economic activ-
ities across multiple sectors, leading to decreases in employment, and
reducing revenue streams for several businesses (Dey & Loewenstein,
2020; Woodside, 2020).
4.1.6. Cluster 1f: COVID-19 & risk communication
During this crisis, understanding people’s risk perceptions is critical
for risk communication (Aven & Bouder, 2020). The risk perception of
COVID-19 is inﬂuenced by several societal, cultural, and psychological
factors and aﬀect one’s preparedness and planning (Giritli Nygren &
Olofsson, 2020). Therefore, risk communication should be based on
factors like risk attitude, risk perception, and trust in communicating
authorities. Further, risk perceptions can aﬀect how individuals eval-
uate threats and information communicated by authorities (Aven &
Bouder, 2020).
4.2. Cluster 2: COVID 19 & technology
4.2.1. Cluster 2a (COVID-19, big data, & advanced analytics) and cluster
2b (COVID-19 & data-driven decision-making)
During the COVID-19 pandemic, big data and advanced analytics
are helping to detect surface indicators related to the pandemic (Guo
et al., 2020). Speciﬁcally, real-time big-data-driven insights have
helped policymakers and researchers to comprehend and forecast the
reach and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Real-time COVID-19
trackers are helping epidemiologists, scientists, health workers, and
policy-makers make more informed decisions to ﬁght the pandemic by
aggregating and synthesizing incident big data (Hancox-Li, 2020).
Further, real-time analysis of GPS data indicating people’s movement
within a certain locality is helping the government understand the
population’s compliance with social distancing mandates (Chen, 2020).
Big data analytics are also helping many leaders to make diﬃcult de-
cisions that aﬀect staﬀ, customers, and operational capacity. For ex-
ample, ﬁrms are leveraging their internal and external data on, for
example, customers’ contact history, employees’ information, business
operations monitoring, and social media to understand diﬀerent sce-
narios for sustainable development during and after the COVID-19
pandemic (Donthu & Gustafsson, 2020).
4.2.2. Cluster 2c: COVID-19 & emerging technologies
During the COVID-19 pandemic, digital innovations quickly became
the buttresses of personal and professional life (Panigutti, Perotti, &
Pedreschi, 2020). Connected digital devices enable both remote work
and education. Additionally, chatbots are providing instant life-saving
information, partially relieving overwhelmed health systems (Leite
et al., 2020). Further, geolocation information systems are helping
health workers and researchers to track and map the spread of the virus.
Firms and governments are designing and piloting fast, responsive
frameworks to implement emerging technologies, like data policy, di-
gital trade, IoT, AI, drones, autonomous vehicles, blockchain tele-
medicine, and environmental innovations (Panigutti et al., 2020).
4.2.3. Cluster 2d: COVID-19 & digital healthcare
The public health emergency of COVID-19 confronting global
healthcare systems has prompted the development of digital health
solutions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic (Panigutti et al.,
2020). These digital healthcare systems include telehealth; robust sur-
veillance systems; technology-driven diagnostic and clinical decision-
making tools; wearable tracking devices to measure physiological
parameters like temperature, heart rate, and sleep-duration; and in-
teractive chat services providing information about COVID-19 (Leite
et al., 2020). Telemedicine administered through virtual chatbots and
webbots is emerging as a viable option for communication and safe
medical care. Digital healthcare solutions are helping to detect, report,
and provide surveillance and rapid response for COVID-19 cases
(Panigutti et al., 2020). Further, they are helping with the creation of
geospatial dashboards that display pertinent information at the national
and international scales to track COVID-19 statistics in real time
(Panigutti et al., 2020).
4.2.4. Cluster 2e: COVID-19 & infodemic
According to the WHO Director General, the world is ﬁghting not
only an epidemic but also an “infodemic” (WHO, 2020). This infodemic
is causing an over-abundance of information related to the COVID-19
situation, not all of which is accurate (Yu, Li, Yu, He, & Zhou, 2020).
Such uncertainty can create confusion and distrust among people and,
ultimately, hamper an eﬀective public health response. The COVID-19
infodemic has largely dealt with the cause and origin of the novel
coronavirus, its symptoms and transmission patterns, available treat-
ments and cures, and the eﬀectiveness of interventions by health au-
thorities (Krause, Freiling, Beets, & Brossard, 2020). In response to this,
social media and search engine giants, like Facebook, Google, Pinterest,
Twitter, and YouTube, are ﬁltering out unfounded medical advice,
hoaxes, and other false information that could risk public health
(Krause et al., 2020). Along with several challenges, the infodemic is
also creating opportunities to identify and adopt new preparedness and
response tools to ﬁght COVID-19.
4.2.5. Cluster 2f: COVID-19 & socio-technical transitions
According to Wells et al. (2020), the COVID-19 pandemic has led to
a global socio-technical crisis and several alternative futures. It is
globally, rapidly, and pervasively disrupting existing practices (Huynh,
2020) and is quickly emerging as a catalytic and meta-transition event
that challenges and reshapes the legitimacy and eﬃcacy of existing
political and economic structures (Sendak et al., 2020; Woodside,
2020). These socio-technical changes will redeﬁne future business ac-
tivities and ecological burdens (Huynh, 2020).
4.3. Cluster 3: COVID 19 & supply chain management
4.3.1. Cluster 3a (Impact of COVID-19 on inventory management), cluster
3b (Impact of COVID-19 on supply chain management), and cluster 3c
(Impact of COVID-19 on supply chain resilience)
The COVID-19 crisis continues to globally disrupt manufacturing
and supply chains, with severe consequences for consumers, businesses,
societies, and the global economy (Ivanov, 2020). The global produc-
tion system has been badly aﬀected due to surges in demand for es-
sential goods, factory shutdowns, panic-buying, and shifts in consumer
preference (e.g., online over physical shopping; Ivanov, 2020). Com-
panies are modifying the supply chain by carefully managing inter-
dependent factors, like localization, complexity reduction, dual-sour-
cing, and investing in advanced manufacturing technologies (Garvey &
Carnovale, 2020). Apart from these initiatives, manufacturing ﬁrms are
taking measures to ensure business continuity. These measures include
cross-functional controls and coordination on a global and regional
level, increase in safety stocks and shift inventories, pivot freight
models, improved customer support programs, rebound measures for
demand returns, and quick reactions to changing sources of demand in

order to secure revenue streams (Ivanov & Dolgui, 2020).
4.4. Cluster 4: COVID 19 & service industry
4.4.1. Cluster 4a: Impact of COVID-19 on travel & tourism
The viral outbreak has paralyzed the tourism industry, leading to
job losses and devastating economies that are highly dependent on
tourism (Boulos & Geraghty, 2020). Tourism and cities have strongly
intertwined economic, social, and environmental relationships, which
shape localities, landscapes, and regions. According to the United Na-
tions World Tourism Organization (UNTWO), this pandemic has led to a
potential loss of USD 30–50 billion for the travel and tourism industry
(UNWTO, 2020), as several countries and regions have imposed entry
and exit bans and other restrictions, which have decreased willingness
to travel (Higgins-Desbiolles, 2020).
4.4.2. Cluster 4b: Impact of COVID-19 on education
Closure of educational institutes due to the pandemic has not only
aﬀected students and teachers but also created economic and social
consequences related to digital learning, Internet facilities, childcare,
food insecurity, healthcare, and housing (Arora & Srinivasan, 2020). As
of May 10, 2020, 1.3 billion (approximately 73.5 percent) students
across 177 countries have been aﬀected by the closure of educational
institutes (Zhang, Wang, Yang, & Wang, 2020). Educational institutes
are opting to conduct classes through internet, digital devices and on-
line platforms (like group video programs) (Arora & Srinivasan, 2020).
4.4.3. Cluster 4c: COVID-19 & essential services
The COVID-19 crisis is aﬀecting all service sectors due to either
spikes or surges in demand. For example, while the retail, tourism, and
aviation sectors have been badly aﬀected due to the closure of services
to mitigate the risk, food retailers and grocery stores are struggling with
rising demand as consumers are trying to stock up for long periods of
isolation (Addo, Jiaming, Kulbo, & Liangqiang, 2020). Essential service
workers are working in grim and testing working environments, con-
tinuously exposed to the virus with no choice but to work (Frazer,
Merrilees, Nathan, & Thaichon, 2020). Therefore, essential services
need to consider the direct and indirect impacts on employees’ occu-
pational safety and health.
5. Research propositions for future studies
As the COVID-19 crisis continues to impact businesses in the next
few years, economic, societal, and technological changes will become
unavoidable for survival. Given this backdrop, the current study pre-
sents a bibliometric review of 107 papers on the ramiﬁcations of
COVID-19 in the domain of business and management in order to de-
lineate this emerging research ﬁeld and summarize the available
knowledge. This sub-section provides a synopsis of the four main
clusters discussed in Section 4. The synthesis of four distinct research
streams in the COVID-19 domain reveals several new opportunities for
future practice and research work (Table 2).
5.1. Cluster 1: Overall impact of COVID-19 on business
Due to fears of a ﬁnancial collapse and new recession, resilient
businesses and sturdy government leadership are urgent and critical
(Giritli Nygren & Olofsson, 2020). Short-, medium-, and long-term
plans are required to rebalance and re-energize the economy (Michie,
2020). In addition, socioeconomic risk assessments and strategies for
robust and sustainable business models are required across every sector.
The COVID-19 pandemic is radically changing the demand pattern for
products/services, which has in turn increased the risk of fragility in
global and regional supply chains and networks (Lee et al., 2020). To
sustain and position themselves for the “new normal,” ﬁrms should
improve their operational resilience, accelerate end-to-end value chain
digitization, rapidly increase the transparency of capital and operating
expenses, embrace remote work, reimagine sustainable operations, and
ensure competitive advantage. In addition, start-ups need to be more
ﬂexible and adapt their business models to dynamic markets. Policy
measures will only be successful if they are complemented by an en-
trepreneurial ecosystem. Further, policy-makers need to implement
measures to protect start-ups and adopt or discard policies in the future
based on the knowledge derived from crisis situations (Kuckertz et al.,
2020). Based on this, we propose the following:
Proposition 1a. The COVID-19 crisis not only requires short-, medium-,
and long-term plans to rebalance the economy but also raises a clarion call
for robust and sustainable business strategies across every sector.
Proposition 1b. The COVID-19 crisis demands new operating models to
meet changing demand patterns and remain agile and productive.
Reforms in trade policy during the COVID-19 pandemic will help to
reduce the negative economic and social impact of the virus, which will
eventually help to build resilience and ensure economic recovery. For
instance, reforms in trade policy can reduce the need for close contact
between transporters, traders, and oﬃcials, helping to maintain social
distancing and limiting the spread of the virus (Carnevale & Hatak,
2020). Further, to mitigate disruptions in the regional and global value
chain, interventions in logistics operations are required. The impact of
this pandemic on employment is unprecedented and will continue to
increase; therefore, economies urgently need to implement policy
measures to boost the demand for labor. The new labor policies should
eﬀectively consider health protection measures and economic support
on both the demand and supply sides (Bell & Blanchﬂower, 2020). Also,
businesses should pay special attention to building capacity and up-
dating employees’ technological skills (Carnevale & Hatak, 2020).
Based on this, we propose the following:
Proposition 1c. Reforms in trade policies are required to reduce the
negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
Proposition 1d. Changes in existing labor policies are needed to boost the

demand for labor.
5.2. Cluster 2: COVID 19 & technology
In the COVID-19 crisis, digital technologies, like the Internet of
things, AI, and blockchain are becoming essential for economic and
social functioning (Huynh, 2020). Drones can be used for surveillance
to ensure safety guidelines are being followed and to spray disinfectants
on aﬀected areas (Leite et al., 2020). AI-powered tools could be used to
obviate the need for manual temperature checks and distance analysis
Panigutti et al., 2020). Data-driven insights have the potential to fa-
cilitate accurate prediction of impacts and can make the diﬀerence
between a misstep and a strong continuity response in these uncertain
times (Hancox-Li, 2020). Although these emerging technologies have
immense potential as equalizers, without the right governance, they
could intensify the digital divide in society. Further, these technologies
are associated with critical privacy and security issues and urgently
require a global baseline consensus on security (Panigutti et al., 2020).
The right information related to the pandemic is key for the success of
mitigation measures, but the infodemic has exacerbated the crisis,
propagating misinformation through social media platforms and other
channels (Huynh, 2020). It should not be doubted that the COVID-19
pandemic has aﬀected relationships within socio-technical systems at
the landscape and regime levels. Global stabilization agents, such as the
WTO, World Bank, and United Nations, can help to create checks and
balances and attempt to ensure a return to business as usual (Sendak
et al., 2020). Based on this, we propose the following:
Proposition 2a. The COVID-19 crisis indicates the acute necessity of the
implementation of advanced technologies across diﬀerent sectors.
Proposition 2b. Resisting the social-technical meta-transition is essential in
the COVID-19 crisis.
5.3. Cluster 3: COVID 19 & supply chain management
This sudden shift in the global production system has raised ques-
tions about the resilience of global and local value chains and has
caused ﬁrms to rethink and transform their overall approach to man-
ufacturing and the supply chain model. Companies should launch
strategic initiatives to create more resilient supply chains. The opera-
tion model should be adjusted to enable more ﬂexible and decentralized
manufacturing with a consistent risk management system. Also, cross-
industry collaboration models need to be redeﬁned, and product port-
folios require thorough reviews to reduce complexity. Based on this, we
propose the following:
Proposition 3a. The COVID-19 crisis demands resilient strategies to reduce
manufacturing complexities.
Proposition 3b. Modiﬁcation of existing supply chain measures is required
to ensure business continuity while dealing with the COVID-19 crisis.
5.4. Cluster 4: COVID 19 & the service industry
The COVID-19 pandemic will have a long-lasting eﬀect on inter-
national tourism due to travel restrictions and changes in people’s risk
perception of overseas travel. This global epidemic has impacted tourist
destinations, leading hotels, restaurants and bars, theme parks, mu-
seums, trade fairs, and cultural and sports events to be deserted (Boulos
& Geraghty, 2020). The authorities responsible for providing diﬀerent
services should provide clear and consistent guidance to workers to
ensure compliance (Frazer et al., 2020). In the education sector, sudden
switching of teaching styles is creating several challenges, like changes
to learning plans, acclimatization issues with new online platforms, and
conversion of lessons and hands-on learning materials to remote
learning and communication (Zhang et al., 2020). Along with these
technical challenges, many students and parents do not have access to
the proper technologies for distance learning, like the Internet and di-
gital devices, or the necessary skills to handle them. Based on this, we
propose the following:
Proposition 4a. The COVID-19 crisis requires robust strategies in diﬀerent
service industries to ensure compliance.
Proposition 4b. Switching from existing teaching styles is required to
reduce the challenges of learning while dealing with the COVID-19 crisis.
6. Implications
6.1. Academic implications
The objective of this paper was to explore emerging research trends
regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on business and management using
bibliometric and science mapping approaches. This article contributes
to research on COVID-19 by elucidating the theoretical evolution of
COVID-19 research and its linkages with multiple economic, social, and
technological factors. Broadly, the ﬁndings and propositions of this
article contribute to the epistemological discourse on collective
knowledge about the impact of COVID-19 on business and management
by examining the most productive authors. In addition, the results show
how knowledge is evolving over time based on the use of keywords.
Importantly, an understanding of the contributions of the most pro-
ductive scholars and their research helps other researchers build on
their work by choosing and following a line of inquiry. Ivanov, the most
productive researcher in this area, has mainly focused on the short- and
long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on global supply chains and
intertwined supply networks’ resilience. Ivanov’s publications help
identify diﬀerent elements of risk preparedness, mitigation, and re-
covery policies.
This study outlines several research propositions that can serve as a
foundation for future research in the area of COVID-19. There are
several theoretical, conceptual, and empirical research opportunities to
understand the development of a new paradigm and advancement of
existing theories within the business domain due to the disruption
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional empirical research op-
portunities have been created by the emergence of a body of knowledge
regarding COVID-19 and subsequent modiﬁcations to this knowledge.
This is the ﬁrst academic work to recommend a set of propositions for
future research work intended to advance this body of knowledge.
6.2. Managerial implications
This study could beneﬁt managers interested in adopting a proactive
approach to understand which changes in strategies, services, and
products are required to meet unprecedented demands and develop
sustainable business practices. A major practical lesson is that the
COVID-19 crisis is quite complex and has caused not only changes in
existing business models but also a need to understand and observe
transitions in the economy, business, and society. The propositions
discussed above suggest that, to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis, managers
require forward thinking, new strategies, and re-planning on several
fronts. The propositions give managers and decision-makers a variety of
practical insights into the challenges posed by COVID-19 and actions
and reforms that must be carried out at the economic, social, and
technological levels. The propositions also help managers to predict the
need for advanced technologies, supply chain resilience, and organi-
zational agility to achieve the right growth trajectory for growth.
6.3. Policy implications
The economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis require urgent

policy responses from the government to support individuals and
businesses alike. Properly designed policy reforms are critical for re-
ducing global market distortions. Governmental and industrial policy-
makers play a paramount role in formulating short-, medium-, and
long-term plans. Governments must be adaptable as the circumstances
of the COVID-19 crisis evolve. The ﬁndings and propositions of this
study demonstrate that governments should reform existing economic
policies to meet individuals’ immediate health, food, and other basic
needs; maintain political and economic stability; and protect social
cohesion. The propositions could help governments and policy-makers
to respond eﬀectively to future crises by reevaluating rules and reg-
ulations, increasing their digital footprint, and revisiting supply chains.
The propositions could also help government agencies identify poten-
tial changes to policy tools to resolve medical and economic issues and
restore shuttered services, like education, trade, hospitality, and travel
and tourism.
7. Conclusion
Tables 1 and 2 provide synopses of the new research sub-areas re-
lated to COVID-19 and business management. These synopses should
provide a solid basis for advancing research in these domains. The
evolution of the COVID-19 literature in the business domain exhibits a
distinct pattern. First, the diversity of topics and sub-topics addressed
by scholars related to the COVID-19 crisis is exponentially increasing,
indicating that the virus has impacted our present and future way of life
on various fronts. The impact of COVID-19 on business and manage-
ment is continuously attracting researchers, who are bringing new
perspectives on research. Second, while the diversity of research areas
is increasing, a few broad research sub-topics are emerging more sig-
niﬁcantly. These core topics include the impacts of COVID-19 on the
economy, value chain, supply chain management, innovation, service
industry, and employment. Thus, the bibliometric results of this study
provide evidence that COVID-19 is gradually emerging as a discourse in
the business area. The identiﬁed core topics serve as pathways for
practitioners and academicians aiming to conduct future research.
This bibliometric study revealed that, in a short time span (four and
a half months), 107 unique documents were published in Scopus and
WoS from 71 diﬀerent journals, 272 diﬀerent institutes, and 61 dif-
ferent countries. The ﬁndings identify the most active authors and sub-
areas of research on business aspects related to COVID-19. Thus, this
study has helped identify potential COVID-19 knowledge domains in
the ﬁeld of business and management. Lastly, co-word analysis based
on keywords provided insights into the main research themes/sub-areas
related to the impact of COVID-19. The COVID-19 crisis will have
short-, medium-, and long-term eﬀects on various aspects of society and
businesses. This study is an early attempt to gain perceptive insights
into the intellectual structure of COVID-19 research in the arena of
business using bibliometric analysis. The ﬁndings of this study com-
plement existing subjective and evaluative literature reviews on
COVID-19 research.
Journals covered in the Scopus and WoS databases are published
and reviewed each year to ensure their high quality. This bibliometric
study utilized only these databases to collect data, but the absence of
other databases, like Google Scholar, EBSCO, and PubMed, may have
inﬂuenced the data representation. Therefore, future studies need to
amply cover these databases in order to collect more comprehensive
data and avoid bias.
