ABSTRACT
Objective  In March 2020, several countries banned 
unnecessary outdoor activities during COVID-19, 
commonly called ‘lockdowns. These lockdowns have the 
potential to impact associated levels of physical activity 
and sedentary behaviour. Given the numerous health 
outcomes associated with physical activity and sedentary 
behaviour, the aim of this review was to summarise 
literature that investigated differences in physical activity 
and sedentary behaviour before vs during the COVID-19 
lockdown.
Design, data sources and eligibility 
criteria  Electronic databases were searched from 
November 2019 to October 2020 using terms and 
synonyms relating to physical activity, sedentary behaviour 
and COVID-19. The coprimary outcomes were changes in 
physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour captured via 
device-­based measures or self-­report tools. Risk of bias 
was measured using the Newcastle-­Ottawa Scale.
Results  Sixty six articles met the inclusion criteria and 
were included in the review (total n=86 981). Changes 
in physical activity were reported in 64 studies, with 
the majority of studies reporting decreases in physical 
activity and increases in sedentary behaviours during their 
respective lockdowns across several populations, including 
children and patients with a variety of medical conditions.
Conclusion  Given the numerous physical and mental 
benefits of increased physical activity and decreased 
sedentary behaviour, public health strategies should 
include the creation and implementation of interventions 
that promote safe physical activity and reduce sedentary 
behaviour should other lockdowns occur.
INTRODUCTION
In March 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 
outbreak a global pandemic, and as of 26 
October 2020, over 42 000 000 confirmed 
cases have been diagnosed in more than 130 
countries and territories, resulting in approxi-
mately 1 150 000 deaths.1 COVID-19 has led to 
over 100 countries enforcing social distancing 
to reduce the rate of COVID-19 transmission, 
commonly called ‘lockdown’.2 The severity of 
lockdown has varied from country to country, 
even region to region, with some countries 
limiting the distance people could travel from 
their homes, and some banning any unneces-
sary outdoor activity.2 These lockdowns have 
impacted people’s work, education, travel and 
recreation, and subsequent levels of physical 
activity (PA) and sedentary behaviours (SB).3
PA can be defined as any bodily movement 
produced by skeletal muscle that results 
in energy expenditure,4 and can include 
exercising, walking, gardening and doing 
household chores. Research shows that PA 
is positively associated with several desirable 
outcomes, including social contentedness,5 
physical health6 and mental health.7 8 Specific 
to COVID-19, PA has been shown to improve 
physical and mental health and has been 
suggested to provide protective elements 
against COVID-19.9–11 Furthermore, it has 
been reported that the COVID-19 lockdown 
yielded decreases in PA,12 however, the liter-
ature has not been systematically reviewed to 
date.
SB can be defined as any waking behaviour 
with an energy expenditure of ≤1.5 Metabolic

Equivalents (METs) while in a sitting or reclining 
posture,13 including watching TV, video gaming and 
computer use. The literature has shown SB to be 
negatively associated with physical, mental health and 
social outcomes.14 15 Specific to COVID-19, it has been 
reported that periods of enforced quarantine can yield 
increases in SB,9–13 16 however, this has not been system-
atically assessed to date in the context of the COVID-19 
lockdown.
Understanding the changes in PA and SB behaviours 
during lockdown is important not only for health 
outcomes associated with these behaviours, but also for 
aiding development of public health interventions in 
specific populations (such as PA promotion and inter-
ventions to decrease SB) should another lockdown be 
enforced, a similar pandemic scenario and/or during 
the return to ‘normal life’.17 The aim of this study, 
therefore, was to conduct a comprehensive systematic 
review on changes in all reported PA and SB behaviours 
during versus before the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, 
stratifying between adults and children, and special 
populations.
METHODS
The current systematic review followed the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-­Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines.18 Details of the full protocol for 
this systematic review were registered on PROSPERO 
(protocol number: CRD42020193065).
Search strategy
Electronic databases were searched from November 2019 
to June 2020 including PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, 
CINAHL, Social Science Citation Index, Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, SPORTDiscus and 
Scopus. Grey literature was searched by entering terms 
into OpenGrey. Search terms were as follows:
COVID-19 OR “Novel Coronavirus” OR “2019 novel 
coronavirus” OR 2019-­nCoV OR SARS-­CoV-2
AND isolation OR lock* OR self-­isolation
AND
“Physical activity” OR exercise OR walking OR running 
OR cycling OR swimming OR sports OR sedentary OR 
“sedentary behaviour” OR activity OR “screen time” OR 
sitting.
Full information on database-­specific search strategies 
can be found in online supplemental table 1.
Results of the searches were included in a bibliographic 
database and duplicates removed. Titles and abstracts of 
the retrieved studies were screened for inclusion by two 
reviewers independently (SS and MT), and then the full 
text of all potentially eligible papers was reviewed inde-
pendently by the same reviewers before making a final 
decision on eligibility. Any discrepancies were discussed 
until a decision was achieved. A third senior reviewer 
acted as an adjudicator if a decision was not reached (LS).
Study inclusion and exclusion
Studies were included if they met the following criteria: 
(1) observational cross-­sectional, prospective or retro-
spective cohort studies (2) that investigate any form of 
PA and/or SB (as defined by the authors) (3) in any 
population (healthy or with a specific disease condition) 
(4) before and during the COVID-19 Lockdown (5) in 
any setting. Published articles that had received ethical 
approval from an ethics committee and were written in 
English were included. Studies were excluded if they 
were not observational in design (eg, qualitative, primary 
randomised controlled trials, primary case series, edito-
rials or commentaries or study protocols). Furthermore, 
the rapid publication of studies related to COVID-19 
meant many bypassed the typical institutional ethical 
approval process; therefore, studies were excluded if they 
failed to explicitly include an explicit statement stating 
that institutional ethical approval was received. If no 
ethical approval was in the manuscript, corresponding 
authors were contacted to establish if institutional 
approval had been granted. If no reply was received, or 
institutional ethics was confirmed as being not obtained, 
these studies were excluded (see online supplemental 
table 2).
Primary outcomes
The coprimary outcomes were changes in PA and/or SB 
captured via device-­based measures or self-­report tools.
Data extraction
Data were extracted by two reviewers (SS and MT) inde-
pendently including: first author, year, country, aims of 
the study, type of the study (pretest and post-­test, cross-­
sectional, cohort), descriptions of the lockdown by the 
authors for the respective location of data collection, 
number of participants, participant characteristics (eg, 
age, sex), inclusion criteria, type of recruitment, type and 
definition of PA and SB investigated, type of measure-
ment of PA and SB, confounding variables, acknowledged 
limitations by authors and authors conclusions, other/
notes. A third reviewer (LS) was available to resolve any 
discrepancies. The data was synthesised in a narrative 
approach.
Quality assessment
Risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers 
(SS and MT) using the Newcastle-­Ottawa Scale (NOS),19 
later adapted for cross-­sectional studies.20 A third 
reviewer (LS) was available to resolve any inconsistences. 
There are three parts in which studies are assessed and 
stars awarded: (1) selection (max. 5 stars)—representa-
tiveness of the sample, sample size, non-­respondents and 
ascertainment of the exposure (risk factor); (2) compa-
rability (max. 2 stars)—participants in different outcome 
groups are comparable; (3) outcome (max. 3 stars)—
assessment of outcome, and statistical test. Scores can 
range from 0 to 10 stars, with higher scores indicating 
better quality research.

RESULTS
After initial screening, 187 studies were eligible for full-­
text review. From these, 66 studies12 21–84 were eligible 
for inclusion. The PRISMA flow chart is shown in online 
supplemental figure 1. Full study characteristics can be 
found in online supplemental table 3. The 66 included 
studies yielded a total of 86 981 participants and the age 
ranged from 13 to 86 years old. Regarding specific popula-
tions, forty-­five studies were conducted on healthy adults 
(four in specifically elite athletes and five in university 
students), and six studies in healthy children. Regarding 
populations with medical conditions, two studies were 
conducted on adult women with eating disorders, two 
respective studies with adult participants with type 1 and 
types 2 diabetes, one respective study with adult partic-
ipants with ‘chronic medical conditions’, one study on 
heart failure patients, one study on neuromuscular 
disease, one study on obesity clinic patients, one study on 
participants with a ‘perceived risk’ of severe COVID-19 
symptoms, one study on pregnant women and one study 
reported on children with obesity. The mean NOS score 
of the included studies was 4.8 (SD=1.0; range 3–7;). For 
detailed NOS scoring, see online supplemental table 4.
PA in healthy adults
Forty-­five studies examined PA changes in healthy adults, 
with only four studies31 75 80 85 using device-­based measures 
of PA. The remaining 41 studies used subjective ques-
tionnaires, and in 30 studies these questionnaires were 
not previously validated. The majority of studies (26/45) 
reported PA changes in the form of time (eg, METS/
min/week, mins/day or steps/day), with the remaining 
studies reporting PA changes as a percentage of the 
respective population (see online supplemental table 5).
Of the studies that measured PA change in the form 
of time spent on PA, all but one study70 reported overall 
decreases in the amount of PA pre-­COVID-19 versus post-­
COVID-19 lockdown. When stratifying across different 
forms of PA, two studies27 28 reported increases in time 
spent in ‘leisure-­time PA’ and one study85 reported 
increases in time spent in ‘endurance training’ in elite 
cyclists, although total PA still decreased in all three 
studies. All other studies reported time spent in all 
subtypes of PA—for example, light, moderate, vigorous 
and walking—(if specified) decreased. Of the studies 
that measured PA changes as a percentage of the respec-
tive populations, eight studies29 33 38 53 55 59 67 81 reported 
that >50% of the examined population decreased PA 
during lockdown, with all other studies reporting >50% 
of the examined population’s PA either stayed the same 
or decreased. For further information, see online supple-
mental table 5.
PA in healthy children and adolescents
Of the six studies that examined PA changes in healthy 
children and adolescents, all were measured using 
subjective questionnaires, with half using validated 
questionnaires. Two studies48 84 used total scores from 
validated questionnaires and two studies65 82 reported 
PA changes in the form of a time measurement, all 
reporting decreases in PA. Two studies62 71 reported PA 
changes as a percentage of the respective population 
and reported >50% of the population decreased their PA 
during lockdown.
PA in adults and children with medical conditions
Thirteen studies examined populations with medical 
conditions for which all but one study,80 used subjec-
tive measurements of PA change, and in only 6/12 
were these previously validated measurement tools. 
Regarding the types of changes reported, nine 
studies23 26 36 40 43 44 72 80 86 reported changes in time spent 
in PA, all reporting decreases in PA time. The remaining 
four studies34 66 69 74 reported PA changes as a percentage 
of respective populations, with all reporting >50% of the 
population decreasing their PA during lockdown.
SB in healthy adults
Of the 26 studies examined changes in SBs, 18 were 
conducted in healthy adults. All studies used subjective 
questionnaires and validated questionnaires were used in 
six. Studies reported changes in SB as either time spent 
on SB or as a percentage of the sample. The majority of 
studies (13/18) reported SB changes in the form of time 
spent, with the remaining studies reporting SB changes 
as a percentage of the respective population. Increased 
SB was reported in all 26 studies. For further informa-
tion, see online supplemental table 6.
SB in healthy children and adolescents
Of the five studies that measured changes in SB in children 
and adolescents, three studies42 62 65 used non-­validated 
questionaries and the remaining two studies71 82 used 
validated questionaries. Time spent in SB was reported 
in 3/5 studies, with the remaining two studies reporting 
changes in SB as a percentage of their respective popula-
tions. All five studies reported increases in SB.
SB in adults and children with medical conditions
All of the three26 43 86 studies that measured changes in SB 
in special populations used non-­validated questionnaires, 
and reported that time spent in SB increased during the 
lockdown.
DISCUSSION
The current systematic review of 66 studies demonstrated 
that the majority of studies found that PA declined and 
SB increased during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, 
regardless of the subpopulation or the methodology 
used. In healthy adults and children, PA during lock-
down decreased compared with prelockdown, despite 
various government organisations and health or exercise 
practitioners providing guidance on how to stay active 
during the pandemic and in self-­quarantine.87–89 When 
stratifying between prelockdown PA levels, three studies 
found that people who were more active prelockdown 
were more likely to show larger decreases in PA.37 49 67

PA has also been consistently linked with several mental 
health conditions, suggesting that decreases in PA may 
lead to increases in undesirable mental health outcomes. 
Indeed, studies have shown significant increases in anxiety 
and depression levels during the lockdown.10 Given that 
decreases in PA have been shown to yield negative affect, 
increases in anxiety and lower energy levels,39 PA promo-
tion during lockdowns should be aimed not just as people 
who are currently sedentary, but also for those with high 
PA levels outside of lockdown. Due to the likelihood of 
further COVID-19-­related restrictions (or another similar 
pandemic), the promotion of digital based PA (such as 
PA apps, online video fitness classes or physical training) 
is recommended. Digital based PA yielded favourable 
results during the first COVID-19 lockdown, with studies 
showing positive associations with such digital based 
initiatives and overall PA during a lockdown.83
Another finding of this review was that participants 
who had medical conditions also yielded decreases in PA 
levels, except for patients with an eating disorder. The 
decreases in PA is particularly concerning as in several 
of the medical conditions studied because PA can be a 
form of treatment or symptom alleviation. For example, 
levels of PA have been shown to be positively associated 
with quality of life outcomes in both type 1 and type 2 
diabetes.90 91 Concurrently, increases in SB have been 
shown to yield detrimental outcomes in patients with these 
conditions, except for patients with eating disorder.92 93 
Given these added risks of decreasing PA and increasing 
SB in these special populations, PA promotion and strate-
gies to reduce SB should be implemented should further 
lockdowns occur. Moreover, practitioners working with 
these groups should be especially mindful of the detri-
ment that decreasing PA and increasing SB could yield 
during lockdowns and make the monitoring of PA levels 
a priority. Patients with eating disorders were found to 
increase their PA, specifically exercise, during lockdowns. 
This is equally concerning as there is often pathological 
relationship between eating disorders and exercise and 
can lead to increased risks of physical complications such 
as stress fractures.94 Therefore, practitioners working 
with patients with eating disorders are advised to keep 
closely monitoring patients as much as possible during 
future lockdowns.
There were also large decreases in both the training 
volume and training intensity of elite athletes while in 
lockdown, which has led to relative decreases in sport-­
specific physical performance tests post-­lockdown.85 This 
decrease in athletic readiness for competition should be 
noted and considered by practitioners who are working 
with elite athletes, especially regarding training loads and 
competition scheduling postlockdown.
According to the behavioural change wheel, for a 
behaviour—for example, PA or SB—to occur, there are 
three components that are required: capability (psycho-
logical and physical), opportunity (physical and social) 
and motivation (reflective and automatic).95 Despite 
information on safe exercise during lockdown being 
available from exercise professionals and some govern-
ments (psychological capability), it is not clear from 
the included studies the reasons why people did or did 
not engage in PA; however, we can speculate potential 
reasons for these findings. A reduction in PA is expected 
as lockdowns required that governments closed sport 
and leisure facilities, group activities were suspended, 
and in many countries limits were in place for time spent 
outdoors.96 This potentially meant people’s regular PA 
routines were difficult to continue with during lock-
down, as indicated by the evidence stating that people 
considerably changed their modes of PA during lock-
down.97 For example, one study found that all types of PA 
decreased except for ‘moderate intensity leisure-­time PA’ 
(such as housework and gardening) increased,26 another 
found that ‘yard work’ increased,77 and another found 
that ‘housework’ increased during lockdown.82 However, 
despite these mode-­specific increases, total PA levels in 
these respective populations still decreased. This suggests 
that promoting increases in house-­related PA may not be 
sufficient to increase total PA during lockdowns.
There was also an increase in the number of people 
working from home during lockdown,98 consequently, 
PA ordinarily accumulated during commuting will have 
substantially decreased. A previous study found that adults 
in the UK (mean age 50.5 years) accumulated 195 min/
week (±188.6) of active travel.99 Those who actively 
commute report significantly greater total PA than those 
who do not, despite no significant differences in recre-
ational PA shown.99 100 In addition, with schools closed, 
many parents were balancing home schooling, while 
working from home themselves; in the UK, this was the 
case for 85% of employees with school-­aged children.101 
A decrease in opportunities to be active and additional 
responsibilities may have led to a decrease in PA.
The majority of the studies in this review showed 
increases in SB during lockdown. This is unsurprising as 
many people worked from home, leading to extended 
sedentary periods and increased screen time.102 103 For 
instance, de Haas et al104 reported that 44% of Dutch 
workers had either started to work from home or 
increased their home working hours, with 30% reporting 
increases in remote meetings (eg, via videoconferencing). 
In addition, with most gyms, leisure and sporting facili-
ties closed, time allowed outdoors limited or not allowed, 
some people may have found it difficult to be active 
during the lockdown.3 105 With increased ‘free’ time, 
many may resort to engaging in pastimes such as reading, 
playing video games and watching television (TV), many 
of which are sedentary.67
Given that the majority of studies reported a decrease 
in PA with a concurrent increase in SB during the lock-
down, and the impact of these on physical and mental 
health, it is recommended that interventions or policies 
are implemented to increase PA (eg, body weight home-­
workouts, using online exercise classes, walking, running 
and cycling outdoors) and decrease SB (eg, by using a 
standing desk and taking regular breaks from sitting)

should further lockdowns be enforced in the future. In 
addition, interventions for PA and/or SB postlockdown 
should consider that individuals may suffer decon-
ditioning as a result of the lockdowns.
Many of the included studies used surveys to gather 
information about ‘exercise’, ‘PA, ‘sport’ and ‘training’ 
but failed to report on how these terms were defined to 
participants. Future studies should report these defini-
tions for clarity and comparison to be made more easily 
between studies. This lack of definition may mean that 
despite ‘exercise’ and ‘training’ decreasing, changes in 
daily PA may be different in these studies. Monbiot106 
reports volunteers providing food packages, collecting 
medical supplies for the elderly, providing childcare 
for those in need, meaning they potentially accumulate 
similar or more ‘activity’ than they realise as it is not 
prescribed ‘exercise’ or ‘training’.
It is important to note different degrees of lockdown in 
different countries, even regions within a country, across 
different dates occurred, making it difficult to quantify 
the severity of a lockdown and therefore challenging 
to objectively assess how this impacted behaviours. For 
instance, those in countries that were able to exercise 
outdoors following social distancing guidelines may have 
engaged differently in PA/SB behaviours to those who 
were not able to leave home, despite both countries being 
in ‘lockdown’. Although the authors have presented 
the lockdown descriptions for each included study as 
reported by the authors, these description vary greatly 
in detail, making it challenging to categorise them into 
‘levels’ of lockdown. The creation of a scale to indicate 
lockdown severity would be highly beneficial for compar-
isons to be made between countries when investigating 
different behaviours, or at the very least it is recom-
mended that this type of information is reported in all 
future studies. Moreover, within countries some people 
are given specific guidance (eg, shielding) which requires 
more intensive lockdown than the general population—
none of the included studies recorded this information. 
It may be beneficial to know participants adherence to 
lockdown guidelines to provide an indication of potential 
opportunity to engage in PA. Most studies also report PA 
without investigating in detail the types, intensities and 
durations of PA engaged in before and during lockdown, 
thus, it would be beneficial to investigate these as the 
magnitude of changes will impact the effects on health.
Limitations
While this systematic review is the first to our knowledge 
to assess changes in the frequency and modes of PA and 
SB preockdown versus during the COVID-19 lockdown, 
the findings should be considered within the limitations 
of the study. First, the tools used to measure PA and SB 
were highly heterogeneous, making direct comparison 
of respective results difficult. Second, demographic 
information was largely limited, meaning that we were 
unable to assess any further changes according to demo-
graphics further than the discussed topics, which would 
have given more insight into the review. In addition, the 
vast majority of studies were based on subjective ques-
tionnaires, which carry with them inherent limitations.107 
Moreover, many studies asked participants retrospectively 
about their prelockdown behaviours and their current 
behaviours during lockdown, thus, the accuracy of partic-
ipants abilities to accurately recall their behaviours may 
be questionable. Lastly, most of the studies included were 
not designed to be nationally representative, making the 
generalisation of these results difficult.
Future research in this area should focus on yielding 
directly comparable data using validated PA and SB ques-
tionnaires or using objective accelerometer data where 
possible. In addition, it would be beneficial to have more 
detailed demographic information, information on the 
severity of lockdown and participant adherence to lock-
down guidelines, and more detailed information on PA 
behaviours, for instance, the types, intensities and dura-
tion of PA before and during lockdown. Future research 
should also consider investigating the magnitude of the 
decrease in PA and increases in SB across different popu-
lations during the lockdown to aid the identification 
of populations most in need of targeted interventions. 
Lastly, future research should consider investigating the 
reasons why people are showing changes in PA and/or 
SB. Using behavioural change theory to assess barriers 
and facilitators to PA/SB during lockdowns would be 
highly beneficial in the creation of future interventions 
and policies should lockdowns occur in the future.
CONCLUSION
During the COVID-19 lockdown, PA levels have signifi-
cantly reduced with concurrent increases in SB. 
Considering the evidence of favourable outcomes of 
higher levels of PA and lower levels of SB in both physical 
and mental health outcomes, and the emerging evidence 
that exercise can yield favourable COVID-19 outcomes, 
it is recommended that public health officials promote 
ways of increasing PA and reducing SB should further 
lockdowns occur, especially in populations with medical 
conditions that are improved by PA, such as type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes. Interventions designed for postlockdown 
should also consider that individuals may suffer from 
deconditioning during the lockdown period, especially 
in athletic populations and people with medical condi-
tions.
