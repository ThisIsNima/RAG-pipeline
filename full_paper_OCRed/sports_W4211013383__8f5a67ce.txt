Recommendations*
Risk Factors
Current literature does not support a definitive cause for initial episodes of low back pain. 
Risk factors are multi-factorial, population specific, and only weakly associated with the 
development of low back pain. (Recommendation based on moderate evidence.)
Clinical Course
The clinical course of low back pain can be described as acute, sub acute, transient, 
recurrent, or chronic. Given the high prevalence of recurrent and chronic low back pain and 
the associated costs, clinicians should place high priority on interventions that prevent (1) 
recurrences and (2) the transition to chronic low back pain. (Recommendation based on 
theoretical/foundational evidence.)
Diagnosis/Classification
Low back pain, without symptoms or signs of serious medical or psychological conditions, 
associated with 1) mobility impairment in the thoracic, lumbar, or sacroiliac regions, 2) 
referred or radiating pain into a lower extremity, and 3) generalized pain are useful clinical 
findings for classifying a patient with low back pain into the following International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) categories: low 
back pain, lumbago, lumbosacral segmental/somatic dysfunction, low back strain, spinal 
instabilities, flatback syndrome, lumbago due to displacement of intervertebral disc, 
lumbago with sciatica, and the associated International Classification of Functioning, 
Disability, and Health (ICF) impairment-based category of low back pain (b28013 Pain in 
back, b28018 Pain in body part, specified as pain in buttock, groin, and thigh) and the 
following, corresponding impairments of body function:
*These recommendations and clinical practice guidelines are based on the scientific literature accepted for publication prior to January 
2011.

Acute or sub acute low back pain with mobility deficits (b7101 Mobility of several 
joints)
Acute, sub acute, or chronic low back pain with movement coordination impairments 
(b7601 Control of complex voluntary movements)
Acute low back pain with related (referred) lower extremity pain (28015 Pain in lower 
limb)
Acute, sub acute, or chronic low back pain with radiating pain (b2804 Radiating pain in 
a segment or region)
Acute or sub acute low back pain with related cognitive or affective tendencies (b2703 
Sensitivity to a noxious stimulus, b1522 Range of emotion, b1608 Thought functions, 
specified as the tendency to elaborate physical symptoms for cognitive/ideational 
reasons, b1528 Emotional functions, specified as the tendency to elaborate physical 
symptoms for emotional/affective reasons)
Chronic low back pain with related generalized pain (b2800 Generalized pain, b1520 
Appropriateness of emotion, b1602 Content of thought)
Differential Diagnosis
Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications associated with serious medical 
conditions or psychosocial factors and initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner 
when (1) the patient’s clinical findings are suggestive of serious medical or psychological 
pathology, (2) the reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure 
are not consistent with those presented in the diagnosis/classification section of this 
guideline, or (3) when the patient’s symptoms are not resolving with interventions aimed at 
normalization of the patient’s impairments of body function. (Recommendation based on 
strong evidence.)
Examination – Outcome Measures
Clinicians should use validated self-report questionnaires, such as the Oswestry Disability 
Index and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. These tools are useful for identifying 
a patient’s baseline status relative to pain, function, and disability and for monitoring a 
change in patient’s status throughout the course of treatment. (Recommendation based on 
strong evidence.)
Examination – Activity Limitation and Participation Restriction Measures
Clinicians should routinely assess activity limitation and participation restriction through 
validated self-report or performance based measures. Changes in the patient’s level of 
activity limitation and participation restriction should be monitored with these same 
measures over the course of treatment. (Recommendation based on expert opinion.)
Interventions – Manual Therapy
Clinicians should consider utilizing thrust manipulative procedures to reduce pain and 
disability in patients with mobility deficits and acute low back and back-related buttock or

thigh pain. Thrust manipulative and non-thrust mobilization procedures can also be used to 
improve spine and hip mobility and reduce pain and disability in patients with sub acute and 
chronic low back and back-related lower extremity pain. (Recommendation based on strong 
evidence.)
Interventions – Trunk Coordination, Strengthening, and Endurance Exercises
Clinicians should consider utilizing trunk coordination, strengthening, and endurance 
exercises to reduce low back pain and disability in patients with sub acute and chronic low 
back pain with movement coordination impairments and in patients post lumbar 
microdiscectomy. (Recommendation based on strong evidence.)
Interventions – Centralization and Directional Preference Exercises and Procedures
Clinicians should consider utilizing repeated movements, exercises, or procedures to 
promote centralization to reduce symptoms in patients with acute low back pain with related 
(referred) lower extremity pain. Clinicians should consider using repeated exercises in a 
specific direction determined by treatment response to improve mobility and reduce 
symptoms in patients with acute or sub acute low back pain with mobility deficits. 
(Recommendation based on strong evidence.)
Interventions – Flexion Exercises
Clinicians can consider flexion exercises, combined with other interventions such as manual 
therapy, strengthening exercises, nerve mobilization procedures, and progressive walking for 
reducing pain and disability in older patients with chronic low back pain with radiating pain. 
(Recommendation based on weak evidence.)
Interventions – Lower Quarter Nerve Mobilization Procedures
Clinicians should consider utilizing lower quarter nerve mobilization procedures to reduce 
pain and disability in patients with sub acute and chronic low back pain and radiating pain. 
(Recommendation based on weak evidence.)
Interventions – Traction
There is conflicting evidence for the efficacy of intermittent lumbar traction for patients with 
low back pain. There is preliminary evidence that a subgroup of patients with signs of nerve 
root compression along with peripheralization of symptoms or a positive crossed straight leg 
raise will benefit from intermittent lumbar traction in the prone position. There is moderate 
evidence that clinicians should not utilize intermittent or static lumbar traction for reducing 
symptoms in patients with acute or sub acute, non-radicular low back pain or for patients 
with chronic low back pain. (Recommendation based on conflicting evidence.)
Interventions – Patient Education and Counseling
Clinicians should not utilize patient education and counseling strategies that either directly 
or indirectly increase the perceived threat or fear associated with low back pain, such as 
education and counseling strategies that 1) promote extended bed-rest or 2) provide in-depth, 
pathoanatomical explanations for the causes of low back pain. Patient education and

counseling strategies for patients with low back pain should emphasize 1) the promotion of 
the understanding of the anatomical/structural strength inherent in the human spine, 2) the 
neuroscience that explains pain perception, 3) the overall favorable prognosis of low back 
pain, 4) the use of active pain coping strategies that decrease fear and catastrophizing, 5) the 
early resumption of normal or vocational activities, even when still experiencing pain, and 6) 
the importance of improvement in activity levels, not just pain relief. (Recommendation 
based on moderate evidence.)
Interventions – Progressive Endurance Exercise and Fitness Activities
Clinicians should consider 1) moderate to high intensity exercise for patients with chronic 
low back pain without generalized pain, and 2) incorporating progressive, low intensity, sub-
maximal fitness and endurance activities into the pain management and health promotion 
strategies for patients with chronic low back pain with generalized pain. (Recommendation 
based on strong evidence).
Introduction
AIM OF THE GUIDELINE
The Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) has an 
ongoing effort to create evidence-based practice guidelines for orthopaedic physical therapy 
management of patients with musculoskeletal impairments described in the World Health 
Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF).320
The purposes of these clinical guidelines are to:
•
Describe evidence-based physical therapy practice including diagnosis, prognosis, 
intervention, and assessment of outcome for musculoskeletal disorders commonly 
managed by orthopaedic physical therapists
•
Classify and define common musculoskeletal conditions using the World Health 
Organization’s terminology related to impairments of body function and body 
structure, activity limitations, and participation restrictions
•
Identify interventions supported by current best evidence to address impairments of 
body function and structure, activity limitations, and participation restrictions 
associated with common musculoskeletal conditions
•
Identify appropriate outcome measures to assess changes resulting from physical 
therapy interventions in body function and structure as well as in activity and 
participation of the individual
•
Provide a description to policy makers, using internationally accepted terminology, 
of the practice of orthopaedic physical therapists
•
Provide information for payers and claims reviewers regarding the practice of 
orthopaedic physical therapy for common musculoskeletal conditions

Create a reference publication for orthopaedic physical therapy clinicians, academic 
instructors, clinical instructors, students, interns, residents, and fellows regarding 
the best current practice of orthopaedic physical therapy
STATEMENT OF INTENT
This guideline is not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of medical care. 
Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual 
patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and 
patterns of care evolve. These parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only. 
Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be 
construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of 
care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical 
procedure or treatment plan must be made in light of the clinical data presented by the 
patient, the diagnostic and treatment options available, and the patient’s values, expectations, 
and preferences. However, we suggest that significant departures from accepted guidelines 
should be documented in the patient’s medical records at the time the relevant clinical 
decision is made.
Methods
Content experts were appointed by the Orthopaedic Section, APTA as developers and 
authors of clinical practice guidelines for musculoskeletal conditions of the low back region. 
These content experts were given the task to identify impairments of body function and 
structure, activity limitations, and participation restrictions, described using ICF 
terminology, that could (1) categorize patients into mutually exclusive impairment patterns 
upon which to base intervention strategies, and (2) serve as measures of changes in function 
over the course of an episode of care. The second task given to the content experts was to 
describe the supporting evidence for the identified impairment pattern classification as well 
as interventions for patients with activity limitations and impairments of body function and 
structure consistent with the identified impairment pattern classification. It was also 
acknowledged by the Orthopaedic Section, APTA content experts that only performing a 
systematic search and review of the evidence related to diagnostic categories based on 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems (ICD) 
terminology would not be sufficient for these ICF-based clinical practice guidelines as most 
of the evidence associated with changes in levels of impairment or function in homogeneous 
populations is not readily searchable using the ICD terminology. Thus, the authors of this 
guideline independently performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1966 through 2010) for any relevant articles 
related to classification, examination, and intervention for musculoskeletal conditions related 
to the low back region. The lead author (AD) assigned a specific subcategory (classification, 
measures, and intervention strategies for musculoskeletal conditions of the low back region) 
to search based upon their specific area of expertise. Two authors were assigned to each 
subcategory and both individuals performed a separate search, including but not limited to 
the 3 databases listed above, to identify articles to assure that no studies of relevance were 
omitted. Additionally, when relevant articles were identified their reference lists were hand-

searched in an attempt to identify other articles that might have contributed to the outcome 
of these clinical practice guidelines. Articles from the searches were compiled and reviewed 
for accuracy by the authors. Articles with the highest levels of evidence that were most 
relevant to classification, examination, and intervention for patients musculoskeletal 
conditions related to the low back region were included in this guideline.
This guideline was issued in 2012 based upon publications accepted for publication in the 
scientific literature prior to January 2011. This guideline will be considered for review in 
2017, or sooner if new evidence becomes available. Any updates to the guideline in the 
interim period will be noted on the Orthopaedic Section of the APTA website: 
www.orthopt.org
Levels of Evidence
Individual clinical research articles will be graded according to criteria described by the 
Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom (http://www.cebm.net/
index.aspx?o=1025) for diagnostic, prospective, and therapeutic studies.232 If the 2 content 
experts did not agree on a grade of evidence for a particular article, a third content expert 
was used to resolve the issue.
Grades of Evidence
The overall strength of the evidence supporting recommendations made in this guideline will 
be graded according to guidelines described by Guyatt et al,127 as modified by MacDermid 
and adopted by the coordinator and reviewers of this project. In this modified system, the 
typical A, B, C, and D grades of evidence have been modified to include the role of 
consensus expert opinion and basic science research to demonstrate biological or 
biomechanical plausibility (Table 2 below).

Comments from these reviewers were utilized by the authors to edit this clinical practice 
guideline prior to submitting it for publication to the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports 
Physical Therapy. In addition, several physical therapists practicing in orthopaedic and 
sports physical therapy settings were sent initial drafts of this clinical practice guideline 
along with feedback forms to assess its usefulness, validity, and impact.
Several practicing clinicians and reviewers noted that the classification criteria summary, 
Table 4, of the ICF-based Neck Pain Clinical Practice Guidelines47 was useful in linking 
data gathered during the patient’s subjective and physical examinations to diagnostic 
classification and intervention. Thus, similar recommended classification criteria were 
included by the authors for this ICF-based Low Back Pain Clinical Practice Guideline (Table 
5), which provides a summary of symptoms, impairment findings, and matched 
interventions for each diagnostic category.

CLINICAL GUIDELINES: IMPAIRMENT/FUNCTION-BASED DIAGNOSIS
PREVALENCE
Expert opinion has likened the frequency of low back pain experienced by modern society to 
an “epidemic,” and reports in the literature consistently support this view. A recent 
systematic review estimates the one year incidence of a first-ever episode of low back pain 
range between 6.3% and 15.3% while estimates of the one year incidence for any episode of 
low back pain range between 1.5% and 36%.159 Low back pain is the leading cause of 
activity limitation and work absence throughout much of the world and is associated with an 
enormous economic burden.174, 279, 288 Also, individuals who have experienced activity 
limiting low back pain often experience reoccurring episodes with estimates ranging 
between 24–33%.275, 305 Chronic low back pain has specifically demonstrated rapid 
increases. Freburger, et al demonstrated an increase in chronic low back pain from 3.9% 
(95% CI= 3.4%–4.4%) in 1992 to 10.2% (95% CI= 9.3%–11.0%) in 2006 in a telephone 
survey of North Carolina households.97
While it is clear that individuals in all strata of society commonly experience low back pain, 
its prevalence does appear to vary based on factors like sex, age, education, and occupation. 
Women tend to have a higher prevalence of low back pain than men, although the 
differences reported vary in magnitude.20, 233, 234, 258 An increase in age is also associated 
with higher prevalence of low back pain. The more severe forms of low back pain continue 
to increase with age83 and the overall prevalence increases until ages 60–65188, 196 Lower 
educational status is associated with increased prevalence of low back pain83, 85, 159, 250 as 
well as a longer episode duration and worse outcome.85
Occupational differences in low back pain prevalence have also been reported159 with an 
association between higher physical demand and low back pain prevalence.205 Material 
workers were reported to have a low back pain prevalence of 39% where as workers whose 
job responsibilities were classified as sedentary were reported to have a prevalence of 
18.3%.205 Although differences exist between different occupational groups, similar low 
back pain prevalence rates have been reported between working and non-working groups.234

RISK FACTORS
Studies of risk factors are important because they seek to provide information about 
variables important in the etiology of mechanical low back pain as well as the potential for 
resistance to recovery from low back pain. A number of factors have been examined for their 
value in predicting the first onset LBP. The two major categories of suspected risk factors for 
LBP are individual and activity-related (work and leisure) factors. Individual factors include 
but are not limited to demographic, anthropometric, physical and psychosocial factors.
The individual factors for which there is the most research include genetics, gender, age, 
body build, strength and flexibility. Genetic factors have been linked to specific disorders of 
the spine such as disc degeneration.15 The link of heredity to development of non-specific 
low back pain, however, remains questionable. A study by Battie et al16 demonstrated that 
there appears to be some relationship of genetics, body build and early environmental 
influences in determining the degenerative changes of the spine frequently associated with 
aging. Degenerative changes on imaging, however, are not strongly related to low back pain 
symptoms314, MRI28 and myelography findings.154 The trend for back pain to increase with 
age is supported.204 There is some evidence that supports back pain associated with heavy 
operating equipment.306 Cardiovascular hypertension and lifestyle (smoking, overweight, 
obesity) risk factors are associated with sciatica.267 There is inconclusive evidence for a 
relationship between trunk muscle strength, or mobility of the lumbar spine and the risk of 
low back pain.133
Psychosocial factors appear to play a larger prognostic role than physical factors in low back 
pain. There are some reviews that question if changes in behavioral variables and, reductions 
of disability that facilitate an improvement in function, may be more important than physical 
performance factors for successful treatment of chronic low back pain.310 There is some 
evidence to suggest that fear may play a role when pain has become persistent.119, 120 There 
is a growing consensus that distress/depression plays an important role at early stages, and 
clinicians should focus on these factors.239 Physical distress, depression, and fear avoidance 
are well-defined psychosocial entities that are best assessed with specific screening tools. 
There is no high quality evidence to support pain-drawing use as a psychological assessment 
tool; therefore, pain drawings are not recommended for this purpose.41
Though some individual and lifestyle variables have been associated with prevalence of low 
back pain, the same factors may not have an influence on the recovery of patients who 
already have back pain. For example, a previous history of low back pain, job satisfaction, 
educational level, marital status, number of dependents, smoking, working more than 8 hour 
shifts, occupation, and size of industry or company do not influence duration of sick leave 
due to low back pain.278 In addition, the clinical course for co-morbid patients, who may 
seem more complicated at the start of treatment, is just as favorable as for those without such 
comorbidities.208 Consistent evidence was found for own expectations of recovery as 
predictor for the decision to return to work. Patients with higher expectations had less 
sickness absence at the moment of follow-up measurement.182 Consistent evidence was 
found for the predictive value of pain intensity (more pain associated with worse outcome), 
several work-related parameters (e.g., high satisfaction associated with better outcome), and 
coping style (active coping associated with better outcome).292

In adolescents, the overall risk of LBP is similar to adults, with prevalence rates as high as 
70–80% by 20 years of age.164 Similar to adults, girls appear to have a higher prevalence, 
with one study demonstrating that females have almost three-times the risk of back pain as 
their male counterparts.295 Anthropometrics (e.g., height, weight, body mass index) do not 
appear to be strongly associated with LBP in adolescents, nor does lumbar mobility184 or 
trunk muscle weakness.13 In adolescents, lifestyle factors that have been studied with respect 
to risk for low back pain include physical activity, sedentary activity and mechanical load. 
With regard to physical activity, there appears to be mixed findings, with certain activities 
related to specific sports (eg, weightlifting, body building, rowing) have been associated 
with low back pain.87, 138, 209 In cross-sectional studies, activity and prevalence of back pain 
takes on a “U” shaped function with back pain increased at the sedentary and higher activity 
end.287, 307 However, in longitudinal studies, the relationship between modifying physical 
activity and back pain prevalence has not been well-established.166, 257 As is the case in 
adults, psychological and psychosocial factors are commonly increased in children with low 
back pain and there is some evidence that such factors can predict future onset of low back 
pain.165–167, 307
Current literature does not support a definitive cause for initial episodes of low back pain. 
Risk factors are multi-factorial, population specific, and only weakly associated with the 
development of low back pain.
PATHOANATOMICAL FEATURES
Any innervated structure in the lumbar spine can cause symptoms of low back and referred 
pain into the extremity or extremities. This long list of potential structures includes the 
muscles, ligaments, dura mater and nerve roots, zygapophyseal joints, annulus fibrosis, 
thoracolumbar fascia, and vertebrae.170, 171, 187 One might expect that improving the 
resolution of imaging technology increased the likelihood of detecting a link between 
pathology and pain in the lumbar spine. However, the determination of a pathoanatomic 
origin of low back pain is made difficult by the rate of false-positive findings on imaging 
studies; that is, subjects without low back pain showing abnormal findings. For example, 
evidence of herniated disc material is shown on computerized tomography scan314, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI),28 and myelography154, in 20% to 76% of persons with no 
sciatica. Furthermore, Savage et al260 reported that 32% of asymptomatic subjects had had 
‘abnormal’ lumbar spines (evidence of disc degeneration, disc bulging or protrusion, facet 
hypertrophy, or nerve root compression) and only 47% of subjects who were experiencing 
low back pain had an abnormality identified.260
In longitudinal studies, low back pain can develop in the absence of any associated change in 
radiographic appearance of the spine.260 Boos et al31 followed asymptomatic patients with a 
herniated disc for five years and determined that physical job characteristics and 
psychological aspects of work were more powerful than MRI-identified disc abnormalities 
in predicting the need for low back pain-related medical consultation. Thus, the association 
between clinical complaints and concurrent pathological examination with radiological 
findings must be considered cautiously. Further, even when abnormalities are present, 
establishing a direct cause and effect between the pathological finding and the patient

condition has proven to be elusive and most often does not assist greatly in patient 
management.
CLINICAL COURSE
Classically, the course of low back pain has been described to consist of acute, sub acute, 
and chronic phases, with temporal definitions typically associated with each phase. Different 
operational definitions have been reported in the literature, but commonly accepted 
definition for the acute phase is between 0 – 1 month since onset for the episode of low back 
pain, the sub acute phase is between 2 – 3 months since episode of low back pain, and the 
chronic phase is greater than 3 months since episode of LBP. The prognosis of low back pain 
appears to be favorable, predictable, and static when these temporal definitions are used.
Since low back pain is often recurrent in nature, exclusive use of temporal definitions to 
describe its course has been challenged in the literature.297, 298, 300 The primary argument is 
that when low back pain is recurrent, the time to improvement from a single episode does 
not accurately describe its outcome. This is not purely an academic issue, as the prognosis of 
low back pain changes when the influence of recurrence is considered. Of patients with 
acute low back pain who were followed for 1 year, 65% reported 1 or more additional 
episodes.21 In that same study, 2 months was the median time to another episode of low back 
pain and 60 days was the median time to experience low back pain in the year. Other studies 
have reported lower, but still substantial, recurrence rates ranging from to 20% - 35% 
(between 6 – 22 months)40 to 45% (3 years).6
When these other factors are considered, the prognosis for low back pain becomes less 
favorable and more variable. At the 1-year follow-up of patients with low back pain 
followed by primary care practitioners, 69% of patients with recent onset (within the past 6 
months) of low back pain reported having pain in the last month.299 Only 21% of these 
patients were pain free at 1 year, with 55% reporting low disability and low pain intensity, 
10% reporting low disability and high pain intensity, and 14% reporting high disability with 
varying amounts of pain intensity.299 Similar trends were noted for the 82% of patients with 
persistent (onset longer than the past 6 months) low back pain that reported having pain in 
the last month.299 At 1-year follow-up, only 12% were pain-free, with 52% reporting low 
disability and low pain intensity, 16% reporting low disability and high pain intensity, and 
20% reporting high disability with varying amounts of pain disability.299
Clinicians should also consider screening for and addressing factors that increase the 
probability of developing recurrent or chronic low back pain. Prognostic factors for 
development of recurrent pain include 1) history of previous episodes275, 300, 2) excessive 
mobility in spine,133, 186 and 3) excessive mobility in other joints.213, 219 Prognostic factors 
for development of chronic pain include 1) presence of symptoms below knee,46, 169 2) 
psychological distress or depression,46, 238, 2452) fear of pain, movement, and re-injury or 
low expectations of recovery,117, 119, 120, 169, 183, 279 3) pain of high intensity,169 and 4) a 
passive coping style.163, 245, 292
The clinical course of low back pain can be described as acute, sub acute, transient, 
recurrent, or chronic. Given the high prevalence of recurrent and chronic low back pain and

the associated costs, clinicians should place high priority on interventions that prevent (1) 
recurrences and (2) the transition to chronic low back pain.
DIAGNOSIS/CLASSIFICATION
Attempts to identify effective interventions for individuals with LBP have been largely 
unsuccessful, with most interventions being found to be ineffective or having only marginal 
effect sizes. Most of the interventions studies have taken an approach whereby low back pain 
is treated as a homogeneous entity once medical red flags and nerve root compression are 
excluded. Most clinicians, however, perceive that recognizable subgroups exist, and 
researchers agree that clinical care may be improved with effective sub-grouping methods. 
The utility of sub-grouping based on pathoanatomy is limited by an inability to identify a 
pathological mechanism for most patients. Emphasis in the development of sub-grouping 
methods for conservative care has therefore been placed on patterns of signs and symptoms 
from the clinical examination.272 The development of classification systems has been 
identified as a priority among researchers in the primary care management of patients with 
LBP.32 This challenge has been taken on largely by researchers who have focused on non-
surgical interventions with the goal of identifying sub-groups of patients in whom tailored 
interventions can be administered with the goal of more rapid 
recovery.49, 75, 76, 91, 103, 105, 145, 197
The best available evidence supports a classification approach that de-emphasizes the 
importance of identifying specific anatomical lesions after red flag screening is completed. 
While many interventions have been dismissed as either ineffective or accompanied with 
small effect sizes,80 recent reports in the literature suggesting that interventions based on 
sub-group classification have the potential to enhance effect sizes over studies where the 
identical interventions administered in a one-size fits-all approach.34, 49, 105, 118, 199
There are a variety of low back pain classifications described in the literature.252 The 
underlying premise is that classifying patients into groups based on clinical characteristics 
and matching these patient subgroups to management strategies likely to benefit them will 
improve the outcome of physical therapy interventions. Therefore, the authors of this 
guideline recommend a synthesis of these classification approaches by highlighting 
particular subgroups of LBP that have high levels of evidence supporting their identification 
and management. The treatment-based classification system103, 107 uses information from 
the history and physical examination to place patients into 1 of 4 separate treatment 
subgroups. The labels of these 4 subgroups, which are mobilization, specific exercise, 
immobilization, and traction, intend to capture the primary focus of the physical therapy 
intervention. Fritz et al,105 utilizing a randomized clinical trial of 78 patients with acute, 
work-related low back pain, reported that patients who received interventions matched with 
their impairments of body function found during the physical examination had better 
outcomes than patients who received interventions that were not matched with their physical 
examination findings. The classification system described in this practice guideline linked to 
the ICF, parallels the treatment-based classification system103 with 2 noteworthy differences. 
The first difference is that the labels in this clinical practice guideline incorporate the 
following ICF impairments of body functions terminology: Low back pain with mobility 
Delitto et al.

deficits, low back pain with movement coordination impairments, low back pain with related 
(referred) lower extremity pain, low back pain with radiating pain, and low back pain with 
related generalized pain. The second difference is the addition of further treatment categories 
to expand upon the classification system previously described. For example, the impairment/
function based classification system in this ICF-based clinical guideline includes a 
“generalized pain” category to provide a classification for patients with longstanding pain 
who, in addition to movement-related impairments of body function, have impairments of 
sensory function (generalized pain) and impairments of mental functioning (appropriateness 
of emotion, content of thought).
These ICF-based clinical practice guidelines will expand on the work of others256, 280 and 
incorporate the ICF model into low back pain management. Specifically, these clinical 
guidelines will describe the diagnostic classification categories using ICF impairment of 
body functions terminology and linked those categories to the associated ICD condition. 
These clinical guidelines will also incorporate the patient’s level of acuity in the description 
of the impairment of body functions category, describing the impairment category/pattern as 
either acute, sub acute or chronic. In addition to the temporal definitions typically associated 
with the acute, sub acute, and chronic phases of a patient’s low back pain episodes, the level 
of acuity in these clinical guidelines will also incorporate the relation of the patient’s 
reported pain to active movements that the patient performs, such as bending, or to passive 
movements that the clinician utilizes during the physical examination of the patient, such as 
segmental motion testing or straight leg raising. The authors of this guideline proposed that 
the recurring nature of low back pain requires clinicians to expand beyond the timeframes 
traditionally used for acute (> 6 weeks), sub acute (6 – 12 weeks) and chronic (> 3 to 6 
months) low back pain categorization. For example, clinicians frequently are required to 
assist patients with managing acute exacerbations of “chronic” low back pain conditions. For 
patients who have had low back pain for > 6 months and/or for patients who have recurring 
low back pain, this clinical guideline promotes categorizing acute, sub acute, and chronic 
low back pain based on movement/pain relations rather than solely using time since the 
patient’s initial onset of low back pain. Movement/pain relations are commonly used in 
physical therapy for classifying patients into treatment categories that respond best to 
matched interventions strategies33, 86, 99, 101, 103, 104 as well to guide dosing of manual 
therapy, therapeutic exercise, and patient education interventions.172 The dosing of 
interventions based upon movement/pain relations is consistent with the concept of tissue 
irritability and is important for guiding the clinical decisions regarding treatment frequency, 
intensity, duration, and type with the goal of matching the optimal dosage of treatment to the 
status of the tissue being treated. Irritability is a term used by rehabilitation practitioners to 
reflect the tissue’s ability to handle physical stress217 and is presumably related to its 
physical status and the degree of inflammatory activity present, which is relevant for the 
mobility deficit, movement coordination impairments, and radiating pain diagnostic 
classifications used in this clinical guidelines.
For acute low back pain with movement coordination impairments and acute low back 
pain with radiating pain, the distinguishing movement/pain characteristic is pain that 
Delitto et al.

occurs with initial to mid-ranges of active or passive motions - with interventions strategies 
focused on movements that limit pain or increase the pain free movement in the mid ranges.
For sub acute low back pain with mobility deficits, sub acute s low back pain with 
movement coordination impairments and sub acute low back pain with radiating pain, 
the distinguishing movement/pain characteristic is pain that occurs with mid to end-range 
ranges of active or passive motions - with interventions strategies focused on movements 
that increase movement tolerances in the mid to end ranges of motions.
For chronic low back pain with movement coordination impairments and chronic low 
back pain with radiating pain, the distinguishing movement/pain characteristic is pain that 
occurs with sustained end-range movements or positions - with interventions strategies 
focused on movements that increase movement tolerances in the end ranges of motions.
Another acute pain category, acute low back pain with related (referred) lower extremity 
pain, is a condition with high irritability but, in contrast to the above mentioned acute low 
back pain categories, the intervention strategy is focused on centralizing or abolishing the 
patient’s symptoms.
For the acute and sub acute with related cognitive and affective tendencies and chronic 
low back with generalized pain categories, the low back pain does not follow the initial, 
mid-range, end-range movement/pain relations reflective of tissue stress, inflammatory, and 
irritability. Hence, the interventions strategies for these pain categories are not focused on 
normalizing movement/pain relations but rather addressing the relevant cognitive and 
affective tendencies and pain behaviors with patient education and counseling.
In the randomized clinical trials suggesting that interventions based on impairment-based 
classifications are an effective strategy for management of low back 
pain,34, 49, 76, 91, 105, 145, 197, 323 the subjects in the impairment-based classification groups 
were reevaluated continually during the patient’s episode of care, and, if the patient’s 
examination finding changed resulting in a new classification, the treatment was altered to 
match the new classification. Thus, it is important for clinicians to reassess and adjust the 
treatment program on the basis of changes in physical examination findings and that the 
most relevant impairments of body function, primary intervention strategy, and the 
associated ICF-based classification may change during the patient’s episode of care. In 
addition, when using impairment-based classification approaches, patients with low back 
pain often fit more than one ICF-based classification, or do not definitively fit a single 
classification category276 and thus, the expectation is to classify the majority of patients, not 
all of them. In addition, overlap may exist between the ICF-based classification system used 
in this clinical guideline and other published classification systems.98, 308

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
A primary goal of diagnosis is to match the patient’s clinical presentation with the most 
efficacious treatment approach. A component of this decision is determining whether the 
patient is, in fact, appropriate for physical therapy management. In the vast majority of 
patients with low back pain, symptoms can be attributed to non-specific mechanical factors. 
However, in a much smaller percentage of patients, the cause of back pain may be something 
more serious, such as cancer,79 cauda equina syndrome,81 spinal infection,303 spinal 
compression fractures,142 spinal stress fractures,143 ankylosing spondylitis,125 or 
aneurysm.94 Clinical findings that increase the level of suspicion that there is a serious 
medical condition presenting as common, non-serious, musculoskeletal conditions, are 
commonly described as “red flags.” Table 4 lists serious medical conditions that can cause 
low back pain and their associated red flags.24
Clinicians must be aware of the key signs and symptoms associated with serious medical 
conditions that cause low back pain and develop a system to continually screen for the 
presence of these conditions. Such screening may include administering medical screening 
questionnaires that question patients regarding the nature, onset, and progression of their 
symptoms, specific movements or positions that make the symptoms better or worse, and 
any 24-hour pattern of symptom behavior. In addition, a neurological status examination 
should be included for patients with low back pain. For example, patients presenting with 
leg paresthesias (eg, tingling), sensory changes (eg, numbness), complaints of weakness (eg, 
foot drop), or signs of central nervous system disorders (eg, excessive muscle tone/clonis) 
should receive a thorough neurological examination including assessment of sensation, 
reflexes, muscle power, motor control and movement coordination. When a potentially 
serious medical condition is suspected, clinicians should initiate referral to the appropriate 
medical practitioner.

Failure to improve with conservative care can also be a sign of serious medical condition,24 
or misdiagnosis. As a general guideline, failure of a patient to demonstrate improvement in a 
period of time no longer than 30 days can be interpreted as a red flag.81
Recent research is available investigating low back pain and one serious medical condition, 
spinal fractures. Henschke et al142, 143 in a systematic review of 12 studies, reported that the 
5 factors most helpful with identifying spinal fractures were age greater than 50 years (+LR 
= 2.2, −LR = 0.34), female gender (+LR = 2.3, −LR = 0.67), history of major trauma (+LR = 
12.8, −LR = 0.37), pain and tenderness (+LR = 6.7, −LR = 0.44), and distracting painful 
injury (+LR = 1.7, −LR = 0.78). In a follow up study involving an inception cohort of 
patients seeking primary care treatment for low back pain, the rate of serious pathology was 
quite low (0.9%) with most of the identified red flag cases, 8 out of 11, were spinal 
fractures.142, 143 Because most patients had at least 1 red flag, these authors cautioned 
against use of isolated red flags because of poor diagnostic accuracy an developed a 
diagnostic prediction rule for identifying spinal fracture, which included being female, older 
than 70 years old, and prolonged used of corticosteroids.142, 143
In addition to medical conditions, clinicians should be aware of psychological and social 
factors that may be contributing to a patient’s persistent pain and disability, or that may 
contribute to the transition of an acute condition to a chronic, disabling condition. 
Researchers have shown that psychosocial factors, are an important prognostic indicator of 
prolonged disability.310
The term “yellow flags” is commonly used in the literature to differentiate psychosocial risk 
factors for persistent pain from medical “red flags.” Identification of psychological factors is 
assisted with the used of standard questionnaires described in the Measures section of this 
clinical guideline. When relevant psychological factors are identified, the rehabilitation 
approach should be modified to emphasize active rehabilitation, graded exercise programs, 
positive reinforcement of functional accomplishments, and/or graduated exposure to specific 
activities that a patient fears as potentially painful or difficult to perform. These approaches 
will be described in the Interventions section of this clinical guideline. In addition, there 
should be standard processes so that clinicians screening for severe psychiatric disturbances 
(e.g., clinical depression) have clear indication of when referral for appropriate care is 
expected in a given clinical setting. An example of such a process can be made with the 
Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders tool that has been described for depressive 
symptom screening in physical therapy settings.130 A patient with positive screening result 
for major or severe depressive symptoms should receive a focused clinical interview and 
should complete a full-length depressive symptoms questionnaire (eg, Patient Health 
Questionnaire or Beck Depression Inventory). A referral to a mental health care provider is 
indicated to confirm a depression diagnosis if the results of the interview and questionnaire 
provided further indication that major or severe depressive symptoms were present and the 
patient was unaware of this. An immediate referral is indicated for safety reasons if the 
patient had a plan to harm his/her self or others. A similar process could be used for 
clinicians who screen for other psychopathology (e.g. anxiety). The authors of this clinical 
guideline acknowledge that this is a general description for a rather important process. 
However, there are no absolute guidelines for the levels of psychological symptoms that

indicate referral. Therefore, clinicians will have to work within their own clinical 
environments, using available resources, to ensure this screening is handled appropriately.
Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications associated with serious medical 
conditions or psychosocial factors and initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner 
when (1) the patient’s clinical findings are suggestive of serious medical or psychological 
pathology, (2) the reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure 
are not consistent with those presented in the diagnosis/classification section of this 
guideline, or (3) when the patient’s symptoms are not resolving with interventions aimed at 
normalization of the patient’s impairments of body function.
IMAGING STUDIES
Imaging modalities have frequent false positive and negative results, limiting their utility in 
identification of active anatomic pain generators. Therefore, the utility of imaging lies in 
interventional and/or surgical planning or for determining the presence of serious medical 
conditions. For these purposes, lumbar MRI represents the most useful tool. However, 
routine ordering of imaging for low back pain should be discouraged. In particular, imaging 
in acute low back pain has not been shown to yield significant new findings42 or alter 
outcomes.52 In chronic low back pain, the role of routine diagnostic imaging is even less 
well established. Current recommendations from the American College of Physicians are 
that 1) imaging is only indicated for severe progressive neurological deficits or when red 
flags are suspected, and 2) routine imaging does not result in clinical benefit and may lead to 
harm.53
Low back pain with mobility deficits—As this is described as acute symptoms, lasting 
one month or less, in the absence of red flag signs, no imaging is indicated54
Low back pain with movement coordination impairments—Poor trunk muscle 
function has been associated with back pain,189 though it is not clear if this is a cause or a 
consequence of back pain. Nevertheless, this represents the basis for treatment efforts 
designed to improve the firing pattern of the muscles involved with optimal trunk control/
stabilization of the lumbar spine. On imaging, multiple techniques have been used to assess 
the lumbar muscles. In examining the cross sectional area of the multifidus muscle in 
patients with acute low back pain, muscle atrophy has been identified.150 In addition, 
functional activity of lumbar muscles assessed by MRI demonstrating differences in usage 
and signal intensity of patients with low back pain.95 Similarly, cross sectional area changes 
in the multifidus with different postures demonstrate altered patterns in patients with low 
back pain.190 In addition to changes in cross sectional area, muscle composition has also 
been examined. Severe fat infiltration has been shown to be strongly associated with a 
history of low back pain (OR 9.2) and low back pain within the last year (OR 4.1).176 
Similarly, association has been established between trunk attenuation on CT scanning (as an 
assessment of fat infiltration) and functional capacity among older adults with low back 
pain.148 The potential exists for imaging modalities to detect muscular control impairments 
and ultimately guide treatment decisions.

Low back pain with related (referred) lower extremity pain—Similar to low back 
pain with mobility impairments, in the absence of red flags, routine imaging is not indicated. 
In addition, among adults 65 years of age or older in whom imaging changes are ubiquitous, 
severity of disc and facet disease was not associated with pain severity.147
Low back pain with radiating pain—In patients with severe or progressive neurologic 
deficits, prompt workup with MRI or CT is recommended because delayed treatment in 
patients with progressive neurologic involvement is associated with poorer outcomes.29, 82 
In addition, if the patients are potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injections, 
MRI (or CT if unable to undergo MRI) may be indicated.54 In the absence of these findings, 
there is no evidence that routine imaging affects treatment decisions or outcomes in these 
patients.212
Low back pain with related generalized pain—Evidence exists that in addition to not 
having additional prognostic utility, knowledge of changes on routine imaging in patients 
with low back pain is associated with a lesser sense of wellbeing.212 This is particularly 
relevant in patients with generalized pain disorders, suggesting that non-indicated imaging 
should be strongly discouraged.
While not currently being used clinically, functional MRI (fMRI) has been used in patients 
with low back pain to demonstrate relationships between high sustained back pain and 
altered activity of brain regions involved in negative emotions.14 Currently being used in 
research studies, this may represent a useful assessment tool in the future to appreciate the 
brain related changes contributing to patients’ pain experience.
CLINICAL GUIDELINES: EXAMINATION
This clinical guideline will describe a core set of examination tests and measures, with the 
best available evidence, that enable a clinician to determine 1) the presence of clinical 
findings associated with an impairment/function based diagnostic category, and 2) changes 
in impairments of body function, activity limitations, and participation restrictions over the 
course of a patient’s episode of care. Clinicians are expected to choose the most relevant 
outcome, activity limitation, and/or impairment measures to utilize based upon the patient’s 
presentation, needs, or goals. This is especially true within the section for Mental 
Impairment Measures. For example, clinicians should decide which instruments are 
appropriate to utilize for a given patient based upon that patient’s presentation in regards to 
depression, anxiety, or fear.
OUTCOME MEASURES
Patient-reported outcomes have become well-established in the low back pain area. 
Consensus documents have agreed on a “core” set of domains that should be captured in 
outcome assessment of low back pain, including pain, back specific function, work 
disability, generic health status and patient satisfaction.29, 30, 78 The most often used generic 
health status index is the Medical Outcomes Survey Short-Form-36 (SF-36), in particular, 
the Physical Functioning domain.77 The SF-36 has the distinct advantage of being more 
comprehensive in capturing these domains and has been reasonably responsive in trials of

comparative and cost effectiveness studies. However, generic measures also have the 
disadvantage of lacking region specificity and sensitivity to change in specific patient 
populations.
To optimize responsiveness and ease of administration, region-specific measures are 
commonly used in low back pain treatment and research. The Oswestry Disability Index is a 
commonly utilized outcome measure to capture perceived disability in patients with low 
back pain.110, 113 Originally described by Fairbank et al,93 there are also modified versions 
widely reported in the literature.104,107 This index contains 10 items, 8 related to activities of 
daily living and 2 related to pain. Each item is scored from 0–5 and the total score is 
expressed as a percentage, with higher scores corresponding to greater disability. The 
Oswestry Disability Index has long-standing recognition as an acceptable standard, with 
numerous studies that speak to its reliability, validity and responsiveness. Multiple studies 
have been undertaken to determine the error associated with the measure and the minimally 
important change with a most recent international consensus conference determining that the 
minimally important change of 10 points or 30% from baseline.228
The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire is a practical alternative to the Oswestry 
Disability Index. Originally described by Roland and Morris,253 the questionnaire was 
derived from the generic Sickness Impact Profile by choosing 24 items that appeared to have 
face validity in describing patients with low back pain. The Roland-Morris Disability 
Questionnaire asks patients to gauge whether or not each of the 24 items are possible to 
accomplish. The activities are led by the stem, “Because of my back pain,” thus allowing it 
to be region-specific. Like the Oswestry Disability Index, the Roland-Morris Disability 
Questionnaire has excellent psychometrics, is easy to administer and has been shown to be 
responsive in clinical trials. Ostelo et al228 report from a consensus conference a minimally 
important change of 5 points or 30% change from baseline.
Other self-report measures have been reported, including the Quebec Back Pain Disability 
Scale,110, 178 but they have failed to gather widespread adoption. In addition, the Visual 
Analog Scale and Numeric Pain Rating Scales are in common use both in the literature and 
clinically. These scales have the advantage of ease of administration but fail to adequately 
capture the majority of the “core” areas of outcome in low back pain assessment. They do 
assess pain very specifically, though, and have minimally important change of 15 for the 
Visual Analog Scale and 2 for Numeric Pain Rating Scale.50
The process of collecting patient-reported functional outcomes data has progressed 
substantially over the past two decades through the application of Item Response Theory 
(IRT) and Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT), with several proprietary options available (eg, 
PROMIS, FOTO, AM-PAC).135, 136, 162, 254 When compared to traditional self-report 
functional outcome assessment measures (eg, Oswestry Disability Index), IRT/CAT 
functional status outcome tools allows for the administration of fewer test items to individual 
patients to obtain equally accurate, precise, and reliable scores.135, 136, 162, 254 Consequently, 
one of the major advantages of IRT/CAT measures is efficiency with enhanced psychometric 
qualities. In addition, well-constructed IRT/CAT approaches to functional assessment 
theoretically allow for a test to more precisely depict functioning at the extremes of ability

using the same outcome metric, though this assumes the IRT/CAT instrument has been 
subjected to rigorous testing, such as vetted item pool selection, accurate item calibration, 
validated item selection algorithms and scoring procedures. Future research is required to 
demonstrate further the advantages of IRT/CAT functional status outcomes measures versus 
more traditional self-report assessments.
Whether using traditional assessments or IRT/CAT instruments, regular and accurate 
outcome assessment become of paramount importance in determining cost-effectiveness of 
care. Which when integrated with electronic health records software, capturing process of 
care and outcomes become a powerful tool in determining the value of care delivery. 
Combining process of care and outcomes that are important to the patient (eg, patient 
centered care) are the foundation for comparative effectiveness studies designed to assess 
which treatments are associated with better outcomes for which patient.
Clinicians should use validated self-report questionnaires, such as the Oswestry Disability 
Index and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. These tools are useful for identifying 
a patient’s baseline status relative to pain, function, and disability and for monitoring a 
change in patient’s status throughout the course of treatment.
ACTIVITY LIMITATION AND PARTICIPATION RESTRICTION MEASURES
There are instances where clinicians have to rely on more than self-reported instruments in 
determining a person’s overall functional abilities as described in the ICF. This is especially 
true in decisions regarding activity limitations and participation restrictions (e.g., return to 
work). There are a variety of tools used to assess functional capacity in a work setting. A 
systematic review was conducted by Gouttebarge and colleagues124 on four commercially 
available Functional Capacity Evaluations: the Blankenship system, the ERGOS work 
simulator, the Ergo-Kit and the Isernhagen work system, which identified 12 papers for 
inclusion. The interrater reliability and predictive validity of the Isernhagen work system 
were evaluated as good. However, the systematic review concluded that more rigorous 
studies were needed to demonstrate the reliability and the validity of Functional Capacity 
Evaluation methods.
Schult and Ekholm264 attempted to incorporate the ICF core data sets for chronic 
widespread pain and low back pain56, 57 and compare clinical work capacity evaluations.264 
They found that the work capacity evaluation generally agreed with the comprehensive ICF 
core set representing body functions, body structures, activities and participation and 
environmental factors. However, both assessments lacked specific on-the-job analyses that 
would provide critical information about job demands.
It would appear that in some instances when activity limitation and participation restriction 
are an expectation (eg, chronic low back pain), outcome assessment would need to be 
expanded from self-reported region-specific tools to include clinician measured tools such as 
Functional Capacity Evaluations.
Clinicians should routinely assess activity limitation and participation restriction through 
validated self-report or performance based measures. Changes in the patient’s level of

activity limitation and participation restriction should be monitored with these same 
measures over the course of treatment.
PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT MEASURES
LUMBAR ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION
ICF category
Measurement of impairment of body function – mobility of several joints
Description
The amount of active lumbar flexion, extension, and sidebending motion measured using an 
inclinometer.
Measurement Method
Inclinometers are placed at thoracolumbar junction and on the sacrum zeroed with the 
patient in neutral. The patient is asked to bend forward maximally and motion is recorded at 
the thoracolumbar junction (total flexion measure) and at sacrum, which is presumed to be 
motion in the sacroiliac and hip joints. The difference in motion represents the lumbar 
flexion measure. The patient is then asked to bend backward and the difference in motion is 
the lumbar extension measure.
Nature of variable
Continuous
Units of measurement
Degrees
Measurement properties
In a study by Saur et al,259 this method approximated lumbar motion obtained with 
radiographic measures (r-0.93 overall; r = 0.95 with flexion and r = 0.85 with extension). 
Inter-rater (MD and physiotherapist) was r = 0.88 for flexion standard error of measurement 
(SEM) = 4.6 and r= 0.42 for extension, SEM = 2.3.
Instrument variations
Two methods utilizing inclinometers have been described. In one method, the placement of 
the inclinometer is identical to Saur et al’s method but the subject bends forward twice, first 
with the inclinometer at the thoracolumbar junction and next with the inclinometer on the 
sacrum.259 The procedure is repeated with inclinometer placement but with the patient 
moving into extension. Lumbar flexion and extension are calculated as with the Saur et al 
method. A second method has been described in which total flexion and extension is 
recorded. The inclinometer is placed and zeroed at thoracolumbar junction and the subject 
bends forward once and the total flexion is recorded. The subject bends backward and the 
total extension is recorded.
SEGMENTAL MOBILITY ASSESSMENT
ICF category
Measurement of impairment of body function – mobility of joint functions, specified as 
mobility in a vertebral segment
Description
With the patient prone, lower thoracic and lumbar spine segmental movement and pain 
response are assessed
Measurement method
The patient is positioned in prone. The examiner contacts each lower thoracic and lumbar 
spinous process with the thumbs. The examiner should be directly over the contact area 
keeping elbows extended, utilizing the upper trunk to impart a posterior to anterior force in a 
progressive oscillatory fashion over the spinous process. This is repeated for each lower 
thoracic and lumbar segment. The pressures can be also be directed lateral to the spinous 
process, in the region of the zygapophyseal joints, multifidi muscles, or transverse processes. 
The examiner can also change his/her contact position and places the hypothenar eminence 
(just distal to the pisiform) of one hand over the spinous process of each lower thoracic or 
lumbar spinous process and repeat the same posterior to anterior forces in a progressive 
oscillatory fashion. The mobility of the segment is judged to be normal, hypermobile, or 
hypomobile. Interpretation of mobility is based on the examiner’s perception of the mobility 
at each spinal segment relative to those above and below the tested segment, and based on 
the examiner’s experience and perception of normal mobility.
Nature of variable

Measures for determining mobility reported low reliability for ordered scales with intraclass 
correlation coefficients (ICC) of 0.25 in patient studies25 and kappas show poor to minimal

Segmental motion is also be tested with the subject in sidelying, facing clinician with hips 
and knees flexed and the clinician grasping the knee and flexing and extending, rotating, and 
laterally flexing the hip, pelvis and lumbar spine while palpating intersegmental motion.

JUDGMENTS OF CENTRALIZATION DURING MOVEMENT TESTING
ICF category
Measurement of impairment of body function – pain in back; pain in lower limb; and 
mobility of several joints
Description
Clinician judges the behavior of symptoms in response to movement testing to assess 
whether centralization or peripheralization occurs. Judgments of centralization requires that 
an accurate assessment of the patient’s baseline location of symptoms is made followed by 
the precise application of active or passive movements and the associated assessments of any 
changes in the patient’s baseline location of symptoms in response to the movements. 
Centralization occurs when the location of the patient’s symptoms, such as pain or 
paresthesias, is perceived by the patient to be in a more proximal location in response to 
single and repeated movements or sustained positions. Peripheralization occurs when the 
location of the patient’s symptoms is perceived in a more distal location, such as the calf or 
foot, response to single and repeated movements or sustained positions.
Measurement method
Patient is asked to flex and extend in the sagittal plane, or laterally shift the pelvis and trunk 
in the frontal plane, in standing, supine and prone with single and repeated movements in a 
systematic fashion. When appropriate, the clinician can manually guide the movements of 
the patient and apply passive overpressures to the movements. Judgments are made with 
regard to which movement, if any, produces centralization of the patient’s symptoms.
Nature of variable
Categorical
Units of measurement

Measurement properties
Kappa are reported to be 0.70 to 0.90 for novice and experienced physical therapists106, 175

Techniques to improve the precision of these judgments have been described, including 
strategies to discriminate between centralization and directional preference responses.309 
However, the practicality of using these strategies has not been demonstrated.
PRONE INSTABILITY TEST
ICF category
Measurement of impairment of body function – pain in back; pain in lower limb; mobility 
of joint functions, specified as mobility in a vertebral segment, control of complex 
voluntary movements
Description
The patient lies prone with the body on the examining table, legs over the edge and feet 
resting on the floor. While the patient rests in this position, the examiner applies posterior-
to-anterior pressure to spinous processes of the lower portion of the lumbar spine. Any 
provocation of pain is noted. Then the patient lifts the legs off the floor (the patient may 
hold table to maintain position) and posterior-to-anterior pressure is again applied to the 
lumbar spine.
Measurement Method
Positive Test - If pain is present in the resting position but subsides substantially (either 
reduces in severity/intensity, or resolves) in the second position, the test is positive. Mild 
improvement in symptoms does not constitute a positive test. Negative Test - If pain is 
present in the resting position, but does not subside substantially in the second position, the 
test is negative. Further, if the patient did not have any pain provocation with posterior-to-
anterior pressures applied to the lumbar spine, then the test is judged “negative.”

Kappa is reported good to excellent agreement (k=0.87)146 in 3 pairs of physical therapy 
raters evaluating 63 consecutive subjects currently experiencing LBP and with a previous 
history of LBP. As an independent test the Prone Instability Test has limited diagnostic use 
(+LR=1.7 (95% CI=1.1–2.8), −LR=0.48(95% CI=0.22–1.1),145 however, it may be most 
useful as component of a cluster of tests to predict response to motor control exercises145.
JUDGMENTS OF THE PRESENCE OF ABERRANT MOVEMENT
ICF category
Measurement of impairment of body function – pain in back; pain in lower limb; mobility of 
several joints; and control of complex voluntary movements
Description
“Aberrant movement” includes the presence of any of the following: Painful arc with flexion 
or return from flexion, instability catch, Gower sign, and reversal of lumbopelvic rhythm

Measurement method
Painful arc with flexion or return from flexion is positive if the patient reports pain during 
movement but not at the end ranges of the motion.
Instability “catch” is positive when patient deviates from straight-plane sagittal movement 
during flexion and extension. Gower sign is positive if the patient needs to utilize “thigh-
climbing” on return from flexion, specifically the hands push against the anterior thighs in a 
sequential distal to proximal manner to diminish the load on the low back when returning to 
the upright position from a forward bent position.
Reversal of lumbopelvic rhythm is positive if the patient, upon return from a forward bent 
position, suddenly bends his/her knees to extend hips shifting pelvis anterior as he/she 
returns to the standing position.

Description
Clinician judges whether symptom reproduction occurs in response to different positions of 
the cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, and lower extremities.
Measurement method
The patient is asked to sit in a slumped position with knees flexed over table. Cervical 
flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion are sequentially added to the onset of patient 
lower extremity symptoms. Judgments are made with regard to a reproduction of symptoms

Measurement of impairment of body function – pain in back; pain in lower limb; control of 
complex voluntary movements
Description
Clinician assesses the performance of trunk flexors, trunk extensors, lateral abdominals, 
transversus abdominis, hip abductors, and hip extensors.
Measurement method
Trunk Flexors
The patient is positioned in supine, the examiner elevates both of the patient’s fully extended 
legs to the point at which the sacrum begins to rise off of the table. The patient is instructed 
to maintain contact of the low back with the table as they slowly lower their fully extended 
legs to the table. The examiner observes and measures when the lower back loses contact 
with the tabletop due to anterior pelvic tilt.
Trunk Extensors
The patient is positioned in prone, with hands behind their back or by their sides. The patient 
is instructed to extend at the lumbar spine and raise the chest off of the table to

approximately 30 degrees and hold the position. The test is timed until the patient can no 
longer hold the position.
Lateral Abdominals
The patient is positioned in sidelying with hips in neutral, knees flexed to 90 degrees, and 
resting the upper body on the elbow. The patient is asked to lift the pelvis off the table and to 
straighten the curve of the spine without rolling forward or backward. The position is held 
and timed until the point where the patient can no longer maintain the position.
Transversus Abdominis
The patient is positioned in prone over a pressure biofeedback unit which is inflated to 70 
mmHg. The patient is instructed to draw in their abdominal wall for 10 seconds without 
pelvic motion while breathing normally. The maximal decrease in pressure is recorded.
Hip Abductors
The patient is positioned in sidelying with both legs fully extended, in neutral rotation and a 
relaxed arm position, with their top upper extremity resting on the ribcage and hand on 
abdomen. The patient is instructed to keep the leg extended and raise their top thigh and leg 
toward the ceiling, keeping the limb in line with the body. Patients are graded on quality of 
movement by established criteria.
Hip Extensors
The patient is positioned in prone with their knees flexed to 90 degrees and the soles of their 
feet on the table. The patient is instructed to raise their pelvis off of the table to a point 
where the shoulders, hips, and knees are in a straight line. The position is held and timed 
until the position can no longer be maintained.

Measurement properties
The double leg lowering assessment for trunk flexor strength has demonstrated 
discriminative properties in identifying patients with chronic low back pain.157, 181, 322 If 
patients demonstrate anterior pelvic tilt with hip flexion greater than 50 degrees in males and 
60 degrees in females they were more likely to have chronic low back pain.322 The 
assessment of trunk extensor strength has been highly correlated with the development and 
persistence of low back pain.7, 160, 214 Males who are unable to maintain an isometric hold of 
31 seconds, 33 seconds for females, are significantly more likely to experience low back 
pain (+LR=4.05–6.5, −LR=0.24–0.02) with good reliability (ICC=0.89–0.90).7 Lateral 
abdominal strength has been measured in healthy controls and found be reliable 
(ICC=0.97).92, 207 Performance of the transversus abdominis has been evaluated and found to 
be reliable (ICC= 0.58 95% CI 0.28–0.78).67, 157, 281 A 4mmHg decrease in pressure is 
established as normal whereas the inability to decrease the pressure biofeedback device 
measure by 2 mmHg is associated with incidence of low back pain.157, 168, 251 The hip 
abduction test has demonstrated discriminative ability to predict patients who will develop 
pain with standing (+LR= 2.68–4.59).221, 222 Endurance assessment of the bridge position to 
assess gluteus maximus strength has demonstrated good reliability (ICC= 0.84).262 Mean 
duration of hold for patients with low back pain is 76.7 seconds compared to 172.9 in 
persons without low back pain.262
Instrument variations
There are numerous alternate test positions for all described muscle groups. For trunk 
flexion test variations include a bent double leg lowering and sit up tasks. For trunk 
extension numerous variations have been described including the Sorensen test and prone 
double straight leg raise.7, 160, 214 Transversus abdominis performance has been described by 
a palpatory method.67 Hip abduction and hip extension strength can both be assessed with 
manual muscle testing.173 Clinician’s selection of test may be dependent on patient’s level of 
conditioning and symptoms behavior.

ICF category:
Measurement of impairment of body function – mobility of a single joint
Description:
The amount of passive hip rotation, flexion, and extension..
Measurement method
Hip External and Internal Rotation
The patient is positioned prone with feet over the edge of the treatment table. The hip 
measured is placed in 0 degree of abduction, and the contralateral hip is placed in about 30 
degrees of abduction. The reference knee is flexed to 90 degrees, and the leg is passively 
moved to produce hip rotation. Manual stabilization is applied to the pelvis to prevent pelvic 
movement and also at the tibiofemoral joint to prevent motion (rotation or abduction/
adduction), which could be construed as hip rotation. The motion is stopped when the 
extremity achieves its end of passive joint ROM or when pelvic movement is necessary for 
additional movement of the leg. The inclinometer is aligned vertically and along the shaft of 
the tibia, just proximal to the medial malleolus for both medial and lateral rotation ROM 
measurements.

With the patient supine, the examiner passively flexes the hip to 90° and zeros an 
inclinometer at the apex of the knee. The hip was then flexed until the opposite thigh begins 
to rise off of the table.
Hip Extension
With the patient supine at the edge of a plinth with the lower legs hanging free off the end of 
the plinth. The examiner flexes both hips and knees so that the patient’s lumbar region is flat 
against the tabletop. One limb is held in this position, maintaining the knee and hip in 
flexion, the pelvis in approximately 10° of posterior tilt, and the lumbar region flush against 
the tabletop, while the ipsilateral thigh and leg is lowered toward the table in a manner to 
keep the hip in 0° of hip abduction and adduction. The patient is instructed to relax and 
allow gravity to lower the leg and thigh toward the floor. The angle of the femur of this 
lowered leg to the line of the trunk (and table top) is measured. The amount of knee flexion 
is also monitored to assess the relative flexibility of the two-joint hip flexors.

motion assessment has also been described as being assessed in prone.73, 206, 247
MENTAL IMPAIRMENT MEASURES
The identification of affective or cognitive factors that coexist with the patient’s presentation 
of low back pain allows the practitioner to determine the potential psychosocial or 
psychological influence on the clinical presentation. A variety of methods to screen for 
psychological disorders have been reported in the literature with the focus being self-report 
questionnaires. This clinical guideline’s assessment of psychological influence on low back 
pain will include screening for depressive symptoms, measurement of fear-avoidance beliefs 
and pain catastrophizing, and screening for psychological distress with composite measures.
Depression is a commonly experienced illness or mood state, with a wide variety of 
symptoms ranging from loss of appetite to suicidal thoughts.236 Depression is commonly 
experienced in the general population, but it appears to be more commonly experienced in 
conjunction with chronic low back pain.10, 72, 130 Depressive symptoms are associated with 
increased pain intensity, disability, medication use, and unemployment for patients with low 
back pain.283 Based on this epidemiological information, routine screening for depression 
should be part of the clinical diagnosis of LBP.
Effective screening for depression involves more than just generating a clinical impression 
that the patient is depressed. Separate studies involving spine surgeons126 and physical 
therapists130 have demonstrated that clinical impressions are not sensitive enough to detect 
depression in patients with LBP. Available evidence suggests that 2 specific questions from 
the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders patient questionnaire can be used to screen 
for depressive symptoms in physical therapy settings.130, 313 The questions suggested for use 
are (1) “During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or 
hopeless?” and (2) “During the past month, have you often been bothered by little interest or 
pleasure in doing things?” The patient responds to the questions with “yes” or “no” and the 
number of yes items are totaled, giving a potential range of 0–2. If a patient responds “no” to

both questions depression is highly unlikely with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.07. 
Answering “yes” to one or both questions should raise suspicion of depressive symptoms.313
Fear-avoidance beliefs are a composite measure of the patient’s fear related to low back 
pain, how these beliefs may affect physical activity and work.191, 296, 302 Prospective studies 
suggest fear-avoidance beliefs are predictive of the development of chronic low back 
pain.108, 109, 177, 268 As a result, identification of elevated fear-avoidance beliefs has been 
suggested to as an important component in the assessment of low back pain. The Fear-
Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) is commonly used to assess fear-avoidance beliefs 
in patients with LBP and has physical activity (FABQ-PA) and work (FABQ-W) scales.302 
Several studies indicate that the FABQ is a reliable and valid measure,120, 158, 230, 302 
suggesting it is appropriate for use in clinical settings.
Pain catastrophizing is a negative belief that the experienced pain will inevitably result in the 
worst possible outcome.284 Pain catastrophizing is believed to be a multidimensional 
construct comprised of rumination, helplessness, and pessimism.284 Pain catastrophizing has 
also been linked to the development and maintenance of chronic pain syndromes. Frequent 
pain catastrophizing during acute low back pain was predictive of self-reported disability 6 
months235 and 1 year later,38 even after considering select historical and clinical predictors. 
Pain catastrophizing is measured by the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), which is a 13-
item scale that assesses the degree of catastrophic cognitions a patient experiences while in 
pain.282
In addition to assessing psychological constructs, clinicians also have the option to screen 
for psychosocial distress. One example is the Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire 
(OMPQ). A systematic review found that the OMPQ had moderate ability to predict long 
term pain and disability, and was recommended for clinical use.156 Another example of a 
questionnaire to screen for psychosocial distress is the Subgroups for Targeted Treatment 
(STarT) Back Screening Tool. The STarT Back screening Tool was originally developed for 
use in primary care settings where it has demonstrated sound measurement,152 and recently 
the STarT Back Screening Tool demonstrated potential for its use in physical therapy 
settings100. Finally, there is a 5 item clinical prediction tool developed in primary care to 
identify patients that are at risk for long term functional limitations. Patients responding 
positively to the following questions; feeling everything is an effort, trouble getting breath, 
hot/cold spells, numbness/tingling in parts of body, and pain in heart/chest; were at elevated 
risk for poorer 2 year outcomes.84

Description
The Fear-avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) assesses fear- avoidance beliefs 
associated with low back pain and consists of a 4-item FABQ physical activity scale (FABQ-
PA), potentially ranging from 0 to 24 – when only summing responses to items 2 through 5, 
and a 7-item FABQ work scale (FABQ-W), potentially ranging from 0 to 42 – when only 
summing responses to items 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 & 15, with higher scores indicating higher 
levels of fear-avoidance beliefs for both FABQ scales.302 Patients rate their agreement with 
statements related to either physical activity or work on a 7-point Likert scale (0 = 
“completely disagree,” 6 = “completely agree”).302

demonstrate internal consistency.180, 274, 285, 286, 302 The FABQ-W has demonstrated 
predictive validity for disability and work loss in patients with LBP.108, 109, 118, 274 A 
suggested FABQ-W cutoff score of >29 has been suggested as an indicator of return to work 
status in patients receiving physical therapy for acute occupational LBP108 and a cutoff score 
of >22 has been suggested in non-working populations.119 An FABQ-PA cutoff score of >14, 
based on a median-split of the FABQ has been suggested as an indicator of treatment 
outcomes in LBP patients seeking care from primary care or osteopathic physicians.37 Data 
from 2 separate physical therapy intervention clinical trials indicated that the FABQ-W 
cutoff score (>29) was a better predictor of self-reported disability at 6-months in 
comparison to the FABQ-PA cutoff score (>14).119 Another psychometric analysis indicated 
that single items of the FABQ-PA and FABQ-W were able to accurately identify those with 
elevated (above median) or not elevated (below median) total FABQ-PA and FABQ-W 
scores.137

Description
The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) assesses the degree of catastrophic cognitions due to 
LBP.282 Pain catastrophizing has been broadly defined as an exaggerated negative orientation 
towards actual or anticipated pain experiences.282 The PCS is a 13-item questionnaire with a 
potential range of 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating higher levels of pain catastrophizing. 
The PCS assesses 3 independent dimensions of pain catastrophizing: rumination (items 8–11 
– ruminating thoughts, worrying, inability to inhibit pain related thoughts); magnification 
(items 6,7,13 – magnification of the unpleasantness of pain situations and expectancies for 
negative outcomes); and helplessness (items 1–5, 12 – inability to deal with painful 
situations).282, 291 Patients rate their agreement with statements related to thoughts and 
feelings when experiencing pain on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = “not at all,” 4 = “all the 
time”).282

The Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (OMPSQ) (also referred to as the 
Acute Low Back Pain Screening Questionnaire) was originally developed to assist primary 
care practitioners in identifying psychosocial “yellow-flags” and patients at risk for future 
work disability due to pain. The OMPSQ is a 25-item screening questionnaire (of which 21 
are scored) that consists of items involving pain location (item 4), work absence due to pain 
(item 5), pain duration (item 6), pain intensity (items 8 and 9), control over pain (item 11), 
frequency of pain episodes (item 10), functional ability (items 20 through 24), mood (items 
12 and 13), perceptions of work (items 7 and 16), patients estimate of prognosis (items 14 
and 15), and fear-avoidance (items 17 through 19).194 The scored-items are summed to 
provide a total score potentially ranging from 0 to 210, with higher scores indicating a

SUBGROUPS FOR TARGETED TREATMENT BACK SCREENING TOOL
ICF Category
Measurement of limitation in activities and participation - completing the daily routine;

Measurement of impairment of body function – pain in back; pain in lower limb; content of 
thought; and thought functions, specified as the tendency to elaborate physical symptoms for 
cognitive/ideational reasons; appropriateness of emotion (mental functions that produce 
congruence of feeling or affect with the situation, such as happiness at receiving good news); 
range of emotion (mental functions that produce the spectrum of experience of arousal of 
affect or feelings such as love, hate, anxiousness, sorrow, joy, fear and anger); and emotional 
functions, specified as the tendency to elaborate physical symptoms for emotional/affective 
reasons
Description
The Subgroups for Targeted Treatment (STarT) Back Screening Tool is a 9-item screening 
measure used to identify subgroups of patients with low back pain in primary care settings 
based on the presence of potentially modifiable prognostic factors which may be useful in 
matching patients with targeted interventions.152 The STarT contains items related to 
physical (items 2, 3, 5, 6) and psychosocial (items 1, 4, 7, 8, 9) factors that have been 
identified as strong independent predictors for persistent disabling LBP.
Measurement method
Potential responses for the STarT are dichotomized (‘agree’ or ‘disagree’), with the 
exception of an item related to ‘bothersomeness’ which uses a 5-point Likert scale. Overall 
STarT scores (ranging from 0 to 9) are determined by summing all positive responses. 
Psychosocial subscale scores (ranging from 0 to 5) are determined by summing items related 
to bothersomeness, fear, catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression (i.e., items 1, 4, 7, 8, 9). 
Based on overall and psychosocial subscale scoring, the STarT categorizes patients as ‘high-
risk’ (psychosocial subscale scores ≥4) in which high levels of psychosocial prognostic 
factors are present with or without physical factors present, ‘medium-risk’ (overall score >3; 
psychosocial subscale score <4) in which physical and psychosocial factors are present, but 
not a high level of psychosocial factors, or ‘low-risk’ (overall score 0–3) in which few 
prognostic factors are present.139

Measurement properties
The STarT overall (0.79, 95% CI: 0.73 – 0.95) and psychosocial subscale (0.76, 95% CI: 
0.52 – 0.89) scores has been found to have acceptable test-retest reliability (weighted kappa 
values) in patients with stable symptoms.152 Cronbach’s alpha estimates for overall (.79) and 
psychosocial subscale (.74) scores suggest the STarT has demonstrates internal 
consistency.152 The predictive validity of the STarT has been reported in which sub grouping 
cutoff scores were predictive of poor 6-month disability outcomes in low (16.7%), medium 
(53.2%), and high (78.4%) risk subgroups.152 The discriminant validity of the STarT scores 
(AUC range: 0.73 – 0.92) have been reported and suggest that overall scores best 
discriminate physical reference standards (eg, disability and referred leg pain), while 
psychosocial subscale scores best discriminate psychosocial reference standards (eg, 
catastrophizing, fear, and depression).152 The STarT has demonstrated concurrent validity in 
comparison to the Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire, in which both 
instruments displayed similar subgroup characteristics and the ability to discriminate for 
disability, catastrophizing, fear, comorbid pain and time off work reference standards.153 
Subgroup status has corresponded to initial pain intensity and disability scores in an ordinal 
manner for patients seeking care in outpatient physical therapy settings and longitudinal 
analyses indicated different patterns of change for clinical outcomes.100
CLINICAL GUIDELINES: INTERVENTIONS
A variety of interventions have been described for the treatment of low back pain, and it is 
not the intention of these clinical practice guidelines to exhaustively review all interventions. 
Instead these guidelines focus on approaches in which randomized, controlled trials and/or 
systematic reviews that have tested these interventions in environments that would match 
physical therapy application. In keeping with the overall theme of these guidelines we are 
focusing on the peer-review literature and making recommendations related to 1) treatment

matched to subgroup responder categories, 2) treatments that have evidence to prevent 
recurrence, and 3) treatments that have evidence to influence the progression from acute to 
chronic low back pain and disability.
It is believed that early physical therapy intervention can help reduce the risk of conversion 
of patients with acute low back pain to patients with chronic symptoms. A study by Linton 
demonstrated that early active physical therapy intervention for patients with the first 
episode of acute musculoskeletal pain significantly decreased the incidence of chronic 
pain.195 This study represented a cohort study comparing patients who received early versus 
delayed or no PT intervention for occupational related injury. At 12-month follow-up the 
group who received early active physical therapy had significant reductions in amount of 
work time lost. Only 2% of patients who received early intervention went on develop 
chronic symptoms compared to 15% of the delayed treatment group.195 These findings have 
been supported numerous times.114, 128, 193, 225, 240, 304
MANUAL THERAPY
Thrust and non-thrust mobilization/manipulation is a common intervention utilized for 
acute, sub acute, and chronic low back pain. Despite its popularity, recent systematic reviews 
have demonstrated marginal treatment effect across the heterogeneous group of patients with 
low back pain.8, 9 Also, most trials have assessed the efficacy of mobilization/manipulation 
in isolation rather than in combination with active therapies. Recent research has 
demonstrated that spinal manipulative therapy is effective for subgroups of patients, and as a 
component of a comprehensive treatment plan, rather than in isolation.
Research has determined a subgroup of patients likely to have dramatic changes with 
application of thrust manipulation to the lumbar spine, advice to remain active, and mobility 
exercise. Flynn conducted an initial derivation study of patients most likely to benefit from a 
general lumbopelvic thrust manipulation.96 Five variables were determined to be predictors 
of rapid treatment success, defined as a 50% reduction in Oswestry Disability Index scores 
within two visits. These predictors included:
•
Duration of symptoms < 16 days
•
No symptoms distal to the knee
•
Lumbar hypomobility
•
At least one hip with >35° of internal rotation
•
FABQ work score < 19
The presence of 4 or more predictors increased the probability of success with thrust 
manipulation from 45% to 95%.
This test item cluster was validated by Childs et al,49 which demonstrated similar results 
with patients meeting four of the five predictors who received thrust manipulation (+LR 
13.2, 95% CI=3.4, 52.1). Patients were randomized to receive either spinal manipulation or 
trunk strengthening exercises. Patients meeting the rule who received manipulation had 
greater reductions in disability than all other subjects. These results remained significant at 6

month follow-up. A pragmatic rule has also been published to predict dramatic improvement 
looking at two factors:
•
Duration < 16 days
•
Not having symptoms distal to the knee
If these two factors were present, patients had a moderate-large shift in probability of a 
successful outcome following application of thrust manipulation (+LR= 7.2, 95% CI: 3.2, 
16.1)102
An analysis of the outcomes associated with the Childs validation study demonstrated that 
when comparing patients who received manipulation and exercise versus those who received 
only exercise demonstrated less risk of worsening of disability in those patients who 
received manipulation.48 Patient who received only exercise were eight (95% CI= 1.1–63.5) 
times more likely to experience a worsening of disability. The number needed to treat (NNT) 
with manipulation to prevent one additional patient from experiencing a worsening in 
disability was 9.9 (95% CI=4.9, 65.3).48
This rule has been further examined by Cleland with similar results for patients fitting the 
clinical prediction rule with two different thrust techniques, the previously utilized general 
lumbopelvic technique and a sidelying rotational technique.61 The two groups receiving 
thrust manipulation fared significantly better than a group receiving non-thrust mobilization 
at one week, 4 weeks, and 6 months.
The Cleland61 trial demonstrated that patient outcomes are dependent on utilization of a 
thrust manipulation, as those who received non-thrust techniques did not have dramatic 
improvement. This had previously been established by Hancock et al134 in a secondary 
analysis of patients who fit the clinical prediction rule that were treated primarily with non-
thrust mobilization where no differences were found in a control group who received 
placebo intervention. The findings of the Cleland and Hancock papers demonstrate that 
rapid improvements associated with patients fitting the clinical prediction rule are specific to 
patients receiving thrust manipulation.
A secondary analysis by Fritz et al112 compared the effectiveness of a thrust manipulation 
and stabilization exercise intervention or stabilization intervention. The mean duration of 
symptoms for patients was 27 days (range, 1–594). Patients that were assessed to have 
lumbar hypomobility on physical examination demonstrated more significant improvements 
with the manipulation and exercise intervention than stabilization alone. Seventy-four 
percent of patients with hypomobility who received manipulation were deemed successful as 
compared to 26% of patients with hypermobility that were treated with manipulation. These 
findings may suggest that assessment of hypomobility, in the absence of contraindications, is 
sufficient to consider use of thrust manipulation as a component of comprehensive 
treatment.
Beyond the success associated with the usage of thrust manipulation in patients with acute 
low back pain who fit the clinical prediction rule, there is evidence for the use of thrust 
manipulation in other patients experiencing low back pain. Aure and colleagues11

demonstrated superior reductions in pain and disability in patients with chronic low back 
pain who received thrust manipulations when compared to an exercise intervention. More 
recently, Cecchi et al conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=210) in patients with low 
back pain.44 Subjects were randomized to receive thrust manipulation, back school 
intervention, or individualized physiotherapy intervention. Reductions in disability were 
significantly higher for the manipulation group at discharge and twelve months. Long term 
pain relief, reoccurrences of low back pain, and drug usage also favored the manipulation 
group.
Whitman et al311, 312 demonstrated that, for patients with clinical and imaging finding 
consistent with lumbar central spinal stenosis, a comprehensive treatment plan including 
thrust and non-thrust mobilization/manipulation directed at the lumbopelvic region is 
effective at decreasing pain and disability. In the randomized control trial, 58 patients were 
randomized to receive a comprehensive manual therapy approach, gluteal retraining, and 
body weight supported treadmill training or lumbar flexion exercises and traditional 
treadmill training.311 Seventy eight percent of patients receiving manual treatments met the 
threshold for success compared to 41% of the flexion based exercise group at six weeks. At 
long term follow-up all outcomes favored the experimental group, although these differences 
were not statistically significant. Manual therapy was delivered in a pragmatic impairment-
based approach; specifically, 100% of patients received non-thrust mobilization to the 
lumbar spine, 50% of patients received thrust manipulation to the lumbar spine, and 31% of 
patients received lumbopelvic manipulation.12 Patients also received manual therapy 
interventions to other regions of the lower quarter and thoracic spine as deemed important 
by the treating therapists.12 This study supports the use of a comprehensive treatment 
program that includes manual therapy interventions in the management of patients with 
lumbar spinal stenosis.
Murphy et al218 published a prospective cohort study of 57 consecutive patients with central, 
lateral, or combined central and lateral lumbar spinal stenosis. Patients were treated with 
lumbar thrust manipulation, nerve mobilization procedures, and exercise. The mean 
improvement in disability, as measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, was 
5.1 points from baseline to discharge, and 5.2 points from baseline to long term follow-up, 
satisfying the criteria for minimally clinical important difference. Pain at worst was also 
reduced by a mean of 3.1 points. Reiman et al,248 in a recent systematic review based off of 
the Whitman trial and several lower quality studies, recommends manual therapy techniques 
including thrust and non-thrust mobilization/manipulation to the lumbopelvic region for 
patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.
The hip has long been identified as a potential source of and contributor to low back 
dysfunction, and impairments in hip mobility have been found to be associated with the 
presence of LBP.19, 89, 249, 266, 318 It has been suggested that altered movements of the hip 
and spine may contribute to the development of low back pain, as it may alter the loads 
placed on the lumbar facets and posterior spinal ligaments.1, 190 Several authors have 
described restricted hip mobility in patients with low back pain as an indicator of positive 
response to interventions targeting the hip.33,44, 53,84,184,284,278,289 Some early evidence 
demonstrates successful incorporation of interventions targeting the hip into a more

comprehensive treatment program for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.278,279 Though 
research in this area is developing, clinicians may consider including examination of the hip 
and interventions targeting identified hip impairments for patients with LBP.
Clinicians should consider utilizing thrust manipulative procedures to reduce pain and 
disability in patients with mobility deficits and acute low back and back-related buttock or 
thigh pain. Thrust manipulative and non-thrust mobilization procedures can also be used to 
improve spine and hip mobility and reduce pain and disability in patients with sub acute and 
chronic low back and back-related lower extremity pain.
TRUNK COORDINATION, STRENGTHENING, AND ENDURANCE EXERCISES
Lumbar strengthening and stabilization exercises are another commonly utilized treatment 
for LBP. These exercises are commonly prescribed for patients who have received the 
medical diagnosis of spinal instability.
In a Cochrane review on exercise therapy for the treatment of non-specific low back pain 
Hayden and colleagues140 examined the literature on exercise therapy for patients with acute 
(11), sub acute (6) and chronic (43) low back pain and reported that exercise therapy was 
effective in decreasing pain in the chronic population, graded activity improved absenteeism 
in the sub acute population, and exercise therapy is as effective as other conservative 
treatments or no treatments in the acute population. The larger criticism that the Cochrane 
reviewers found with the current literature was that the outcome tools were heterogeneous 
and the reporting was poor and inconsistent with the possibility of publication bias.
In a systematic review of 14 RCTs examining the effectiveness of motor control exercises 
for nonspecific LBP, Macedo et al200 concluded that motor control when used in isolation or 
with additional interventions is effective at decreasing pain and disability related to 
nonspecific LBP. However, there was insufficient evidence to find motor control exercises 
superior to manual therapy or other exercise interventions. The authors were unable to 
provide recommendations regarding the best strategies for implementing motor control 
exercise into clinical practice.
A preliminary clinical prediction rule for the stabilization classification has been proposed to 
assist clinicians with accurately identifying patients that appear to be appropriate for a 
stabilization-focused exercise program.145 The clinical prediction rule for stabilization 
classification was developed using similar methodology for the manipulation rule. Variables 
that significantly predicted a 50% improvement in disability from LBP at 4-weeks in a 
multivariate setting were retained for the clinical prediction rule.145 Four examination 
findings:
•
Age <40 years
•
Positive prone instability test
•
Presence of aberrant movements with motion testing
•
SLR > 91 degrees

were identified and a positive clinical prediction rule for stabilization was defined as 
presence of at least 3 of the findings (+LR = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.6, 10.0), while a negative 
clinical prediction rule was presence of fewer than 2 of the findings (−LR = 0.20, 95% CI = 
0.03, 1.4).145 Validation of this test item cluster is required before it can be recommended 
for widespread clinical use.
Costa et al68 used a placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial to examine the use of 
motor control exercises in 154 patients with chronic LBP. Interventions consisted of either 
specific motor control exercises directed to the multifidus and transverse abdominis or non-
therapeutic modalities. Short term outcomes demonstrated small but significant 
improvements in favor of the motor control group for both patient activity tolerance and 
global impression of recovery. The exercise interventions failed to reduce pain greater than 
non-therapeutic modalities over the same period.
A randomized controlled trial was performed by Rasmussen-Bar et al246 that compared a 
graded exercise program, which emphasized stabilization exercises to a general walking 
program in the treatment of low back pain lasting greater than 8 weeks. At both the 12 
months and the 36 months follow up the stabilization group outperformed the walking group 
with 55% of the stabilization group and only 26% of the walking group meeting the 
predetermined criteria for success. This research demonstrates that a graded exercise 
intervention emphasizing stabilizing exercises seems to improve perceived disability and 
health parameters in short and long terms in patients with recurrent LBP.
Choi and colleagues51 performed a review of randomized clinically controlled trials that 
examined the effectiveness of exercise in the prevention of low back pain recurrence. This 
was published in a Cochrane review. Treatments were defined as exercise including 
strengthening, endurance, and aerobic that occurred during the patient’s episode of care with 
a healthcare practitioner as well as those that occurred following discharge from a healthcare 
practitioner. Specific types of exercise were not assessed individually. The group found 9 
studies that met their criteria for inclusion. There was moderate quality evidence that the 
number of recurrences was significantly reduced in two studies (Mean Difference −0.35; 
95% CI −0.60 to −0.10) at one-half to two years follow- up. There was very low quality 
evidence that the days on sick leave were reduced in patients who continued to perform low 
back exercises following discharge (Mean Difference - 4.37; 95% CI −7.74 to −0.99) at one-
half to two years follow-up. In summary, there was moderate quality evidence that post-
discharge exercise programs can prevent recurrences of back pain.
In a randomized controlled trial, Hides et al149 compared a 4 week specific exercise training 
program to a control group consisting of advice and medication in a group of patients with 
first episode LBP. The specific exercise group performed co-contraction exercises believed 
to facilitate training of the lumbar multifidus and transverse abdominis muscle groups. The 
specific exercise group reported recurrence rates of 30% at one year and 35% at 3 years

received weekly interventions directed at specific training to promote isolation and co-
contraction of the deep abdominal muscles and the lumbar multifidus. A control group 
received usual care typically consisting of aerobic exercise, rectus abdominis training and 
modalities. At the conclusion of the 10 week program, the specific exercise group 
demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both pain intensity and functional 
disability. These gains were maintained at a 30 month follow up.
Yilmaz and colleagues321 investigated the efficacy of a dynamic lumbar stabilization 
exercise program in patients with a recent lumbar microdiscectomy. In a randomized study 
they found that lumbar spinal stabilization exercises under the direction of a physical 
therapist was superior to performing a general exercise program independently at home and 
to a control group of no prescribed exercises at 3 months. This study had a small sample size 
with 14 in each group and did not describe any loss to follow up.
Kulig et al185 performed a randomized clinically controlled trial comparing an intensive 12-
week exercise program and education to education alone and to usual physical therapy care 
post microdiscectomy. In the 2-group analyses, exercise and education resulted in a greater 
reduction in Oswestry Disability Index scores and a greater improvement in distance walked. 
In the 3-group analyses, post hoc comparisons showed a significantly greater reduction in 
Oswestry Disability Index scores following exercise and education compared with the 
education-only and usual physical therapy groups. Limitations of this study included lack of 
adherence to group assignments and a disproportionate therapist contact time.
Clinicians should consider utilizing trunk coordination, strengthening, and endurance 
exercises to reduce low back pain and disability in patients with sub acute and chronic low 
back pain with movement coordination impairments and in patients post lumbar 
microdiscectomy.
CENTRALIZATION AND DIRECTIONAL PREFERENCE EXERCISES AND PROCEDURES
A systematic review by Clare, et al59 reviewed 6 randomized/quasi-randomized controlled 
trials investigating the efficacy of McKenzie therapy in the treatment of spinal pain. The 
authors concluded that the studies suggest that McKenzie therapy is more effective than 
comparison treatments (NSAIDS, educational booklet, strengthening, etc.) at short-term 
follow-up. It should be noted that the studies in this review excluded trials where co-
interventions were permitted and may not be generalizable to clinical practice. A second 
systematic review from Aina et al2 examined centralization of spinal symptoms. They 
reported centralization is a commonly encountered subgroup of low back pain, with good 
reliability during examination. Their meta-analysis resulted in a prevalence rate for 
centralization of 70% with sub-acute low back pain and 52% in chronic low back pain. The 
presence of centralization was associated with good outcomes and lack of centralization 
with poor outcomes. Macedo et al performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 
trials utilizing the McKenzie treatment approach.201 Short term results demonstrated 
improved outcomes compared to passive treatments. Long term follow-up at 12 weeks 
favored advice to remain active over McKenzie exercise, raising questions on the long term 
clinical effectiveness of the McKenzie methods for management of patients with low back 
pain.201

Long and colleagues197 investigated whether a McKenzie examination and follow-up on 312 
patients with acute, sub-acute, and chronic low back pain would elicit a directional 
preference in these patients. Directional preference in this investigation was described as an 
immediate, lasting improvement in pain from performing repeated lumbar flexion, 
extension, or sideglide/rotation spinal movements. Of the 312 patients, 230 participants 
(74%) had a directional preference, characterized as: extension (83%), flexion (7%), and 
lateral responders (10%). These patients were randomized into groups of 1) directional 
exercises matching the patient’s directional preference, 2) directional exercises opposite the 
patient’s directional preference, or 3) non-directional exercises. Significant reductions in 
pain, pain medication use, and disability occurred in the directional exercise group that was 
matched to their directional preference. One-third of the patients in the non-concordant 
exercise group dropped out because they were either not improving or worsening. The 
authors suggest that this study “adds further validity by demonstrating that a subject-specific 
treatment is superior to others in creating good outcomes.”197 One limitation of this study 
was that it only followed participants for two weeks post-intervention, thus, providing little 
insight into the long term effects of directional preference driven exercises.
Long and colleagues198 conducted a secondary analysis of a previous RCT examining a 
range of factors that predict a favorable outcome where patients were sub grouped based on 
the presence or absence of directional preference. The authors concluded from the analyses 
that those subjects who exhibited a directional preference or centralization response who 
then received a matched treatment had a 7.8 times greater likelihood of a good outcome, 
which was defined as a minimal reduction of 30% on the Roland-Morris Disability 
Questionnaire.
A multicenter randomized control trial by Browder et al35 looked to examine the 
effectiveness of an extension-oriented treatment approach in patients with low back pain. 
The authors included a homogenous subgroup of patients that responded with centralization 
to extension movements. Forty-eight patients were randomly allocated to receive either 
exercise/mobilization promoting lumbar spine extension or lumbopelvic strengthening. 
Subjects in both groups attended 8 physical therapy treatments and were given a home 
exercise program. The patients who received the extension-oriented treatment approach 
experienced greater reductions in disability compared to those subjects who received 
lumbopelvic strengthening exercises at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 6 months. The authors 
conclude that those patients that centralize with lumbar extension movements preferentially 
benefit from an extension-oriented treatment approach.
Werneke and colleagues309 performed a prospective, longitudinal cohort aiming to 
determine baseline prevalence of directional preference or no directional preference in 584 
patients with non-specific low back pain who centralize, did not centralize, or could not be 
classified. The authors also sought to determine if these classifications predicted functional 
status and pain intensity at discharge. Therapists skilled in the use of the McKenzie 
methodology participated in the study. The authors found that the overall prevalence of 
directional preference and centralization was 60% and 41%, respectively. Results indicate 
that patients whose symptoms showed directional preference with centralization at intake 
reported better functional status and less pain compared to patients whose symptoms did not

centralize and showed no directional preference. One key implication of this study is that the 
patient response criteria regarding directional preference and centralization should be 
considered as independent variables when analyzing patient outcomes.
In a randomized controlled trial, Peterson et al229 compared thrust manipulation along with 
general patient education to the McKenzie method along with general patient education in 
350 patients who reported symptoms of low back pain for a duration of more than 6 weeks 
and who presented with centralization or peripheralization of symptoms, with or without 
signs of nerve root involvement. In addition to the patient education, the manipulation group 
received thrust and non-thrust manipulation as well as trigger point massage at the discretion 
of the treating clinician but they were not allowed to perform exercises or movements 
demonstrated to centralize the patient’s symptoms. In addition to the patient education, the 
McKenzie method groups received interventions consistent with the McKenzie method 
(centralization exercises and procedures) at the discretion of the treating clinician but were 
not allowed to use mobilization/manipulation interventions. At 2 months follow-up, the 
McKenzie treatment was superior to manipulation with respect to the number of patients 
who reported success after treatment (71% and 59%, respectively). The McKenzie group 
showed improvement in level of disability compared to the manipulation group reaching a 
statistical significance at the 2 and 12 months follow-up.
Clinicians should consider utilizing repeated movements, exercises, or procedures to 
promote centralization to reduce symptoms in patients with acute low back pain with related 
(referred) lower extremity pain. Clinicians should consider using repeated exercises in a 
specific direction determined by treatment response to improve mobility and reduce 
symptoms in patients with acute or sub acute low back pain with mobility deficits.
FLEXION EXERCISES
Flexion based exercises, also called Williams flexion exercises, have long been considered a 
standard treatment for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. It has been reported that flexion 
specific-exercise classification appears to be less common and most often occurs in patients 
who are older, often with a medical diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis.103 Current 
guidelines detailing conservative intervention for stenosis detail repeated flexion exercises in 
the supine, seated, and standing position.27 A recent review article by Backstom et al12 notes 
that flexion based exercises have long been utilized to theoretically open or expand the 
foraminal canals and central spinal canal, and thus, potentially relieving mechanical 
compression of the lumbar nerve roots, improving spinal flexibility, and improving 
hemodynamics.
A previously discussed multicenter randomized, controlled trial by Whitman et al311 
compared two physical therapy programs for patients with both imaging studies and clinical 
presentation consistent with central lumbar spinal stenosis. The authors randomized 58 
patients with lumbar spinal stenosis to one of two 6-week physical therapy programs: 1) a 
manual therapy, exercise, and body weight supported treadmill walking group; and 2) a 
lumbar flexion exercise, treadmill walking, and walking program group. Patients in the 
manual therapy group reported recovery at 6 weeks with a number needed to treat of 2.6. At

1 year, 62% of the manual therapy group continued to have successful outcomes as 
compared to 41% in the flexion based exercise group.
As detailed previously, a cohort study by Murphy218 utilized flexion based exercises as a 
component of a treatment program also utilizing long axis distraction manipulation and 
nerve mobilization procedures in a population of patients with both clinical findings and 
imaging findings of central, lateral, or combined central and lateral lumbar spinal stenosis. 
Patients were instructed in a quadruped exercise emphasizing lumbar flexion and alternate 
extension in order to improve overall joint mobility. The mean improvement in disability as 
measured by the Roland Morris Disability Index score was 5.1 points from baseline to 
discharge, and 5.2 points from baseline to long term follow-up, satisfying the criteria for 
minimally clinical import difference. Pain at worst was also reduced by a mean of 3.1 points 
using the 0–10 numeric pain rating scale.
Simotas et al269 performed a prospective cohort study following forty nine patients with 
radiographic central canal lumbar spinal stenosis for a mean of 33 months with treatment 
consisting of daily flexion based exercises. At three year follow-up 9 patients had undergone 
surgical intervention. Of the 40 patients who did not undergo surgery, 5 reported worsening 
of symptoms, 12 reported no change, 11 reports mild improvement, and 12 reported 
sustained improvement. Twelve of these 40 patients who did not undergo surgery reported 
having none or only mild pain.
Clinicians can consider flexion exercises, combined with other interventions such as manual 
therapy, strengthening exercises, nerve mobilization procedures, and progressive walking for 
reducing pain and disability in older patients with chronic low back pain with radiating pain.
LOWER QUARTER NERVE MOBILIZATION PROCEDURES
George115 published a case series of six patients with sub acute low back pain and leg 
symptoms who 1) were unable to improve or worsen their symptoms with lumbar flexion 
and extension motions, and 2) had a positive slump test. All patients were treated with end-
range nerve mobilization (passive slump and straight leg raise stretching) procedures. All 
patients demonstrated reductions in numeric pain rating. Five of six patients reported a 
reduction or elimination of their thigh, lower leg, or foot symptoms, in which two of the 
patients not longer had symptoms and three of the patients reported the location of his/her 
symptoms to be in a more proximal location at discharge. These five patients had an average 
of 8 treatment sessions each.
Cleland et al63 completed a randomized controlled trial (n=30) using the same eligibility 
criteria as the George115 case series. Patients with low back complaints, with symptoms 
distal to the buttocks, had reproduction of symptoms with the slump test, and no change in 
symptoms with lumbar flexion or extension were randomized to receive non-thrust 
mobilization of the lumbar spine and exercise or slump stretching and exercise. Patients 
were treated for six sessions. At discharge the slump stretching group exhibited significantly 
improved disability, overall perceived pain, and reduction of their thigh, lower leg, or foot 
symptoms.

Additionally, Murphy218 utilized nerve mobilization procedures in a cohort of 55 
consecutive patients with lumbar spinal stenosis as part of a treatment protocol and reported 
a mean improvement of 5.1 using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Hall and 
colleagues131, 132 demonstrated an increase in straight leg raise range of motion in treating 
using end-range nerve mobilization (straight leg raising combined with manual lower limb 
traction) in a cohort of patients with neurogenic lower extremity complaints.
A randomized controlled trial completed by Scrimshaw265 compared standard care to 
standard care plus active and passive lower limb mobilization procedures in patients status-
post lumbar spine surgery (discectomy, laminectomy, or fusion). In addition to baseline 
measures, follow up data for pain and disability were collected at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 
months after surgery. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the 
groups for any of the outcomes at any point in time. Due to the heterogeneity of patient 
population and treatment, results must be interpreted with caution. However, presently no 
other data suggest that nerve mobilization procedures are more effective than standard care 
for patients post lumbar surgery.
Numerous other case studies have described utilization of lower extremity nerve 
mobilization procedures for lower limb symptoms.62, 64, 116, 179, 289 Diagnoses utilized in 
these reports included hamstring strain and complex regional pain syndrome.
Clinicians should consider utilizing lower quarter nerve mobilization procedures to reduce 
pain and disability in patients with sub acute and chronic low back pain and radiating pain.
TRACTION
A systematic review by Clark and colleagues60 investigated the use of traction compared to 
reference treatments, placebo/sham traction, or no treatment for patients with low back pain. 
The authors included 25 randomized controlled trials that included patients with acute, sub-
acute or chronic low back pain, with or without sciatica. Of the 25 selected randomized 
controlled trials, only 5 trials were considered high quality. Based on the available evidence, 
there is moderate evidence showing no statistical significant differences in short or long-
term outcomes between traction as a single treatment when compared to placebo, sham, or 
no treatment. The authors concluded that intermittent or continuous mechanical traction as a 
single treatment for low back pain cannot be recommended for heterogeneous groups of 
patients suffering from low back pain with or without sciatica.
Several randomized controlled trials have compared traction to a sham traction intervention 
with no significant differences found between the groups. Beurskens et al22 randomized 151 
subjects with 6 week history of non-specific low back pain to receive either traction (35–
50% of body weight) or sham traction (maximum 20% body weight) for twelve 20 minute 
sessions over 5 weeks. Follow up measures for pain, disability and impression of perceived 
recovery were completed at 12 weeks and 6 months with no statistically significant 
differences between the groups at either point. Schimmel et al263 compared traction via the 
Intervertebral Differential Dynamics Therapy device (50% body weight + 10 pounds force) 
to sham intervention in the same device (10 pounds force) in subjects with a history of 
greater than 3 months of nonspecific low back and leg pain. Subjects received 20 visits over

6 weeks, with pain, disability and quality of life measured at 2, 6 and 14 weeks. Both 
treatment regimens showed significant improvement versus baseline in all measures at 14 
weeks. However, no between group differences was present at follow up.
In a randomized clinical trial, Fritz et al111 aimed to investigate whether there is a subgroup 
of low back pain patients that benefit from mechanical traction along with extension-
oriented exercise. Sixty-four patients with low back pain with radicular symptoms were 
assigned to receive either an extension-oriented treatment approach or an extension-oriented 
treatment approach with mechanical traction for a total of 6 weeks. The results showed a 
greater reduction in disability and fear-avoidance beliefs for subjects in the traction group at 
the 2-week follow up. However, at 6-weeks, there was no statistical difference. Furthermore, 
the investigators identified two variables that may help identify a subgroup of patients that 
can benefit from mechanical traction. Those patients that experience peripheralization of 
symptoms with extension movement and have a positive crossed SLR test had a better 
likelihood of success. Of these subjects, 84.6% in the traction group had a successful 
outcome as compared to 45.5% that allocated to the extension group. Although this 
subgroup of low back pain patients is likely small, the authors conclude that this subgroup is 
characterized by the presence of sciatica, signs of nerve root compression, and either 
peripheralization with extension movements or a positive crossed SLR test.
Beattie et al17 performed a prospective, longitudinal case series study involving 296 patients 
with low back pain and evidence of a degenerative and/or herniated intervertebral disk at one 
or more levels of the lumbar spine. Each patient received prone lumbar traction using the 
vertebral axial decompression (VAX-D) system for 8 weeks. The numeric pain rating scale 
and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire were completed at pre-intervention, 
discharge, and at 30 days and 180 days after discharge. A total of 250 (84.4%) subjects 
completed the treatment protocol, so an intention-to-treat analysis was performed to account 
for the loss to follow-up. The investigators found that patients reported significantly 
improved pain and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire scores after 16 to 24 visits of 
prone traction at discharge, and at 30 days and 180 days post discharge. It should be noted 
that there was no control group and that there were large variations in the magnitude of 
change in the outcome measures used.
There is conflicting evidence for the efficacy of intermittent lumbar traction for patients with 
low back pain. There is preliminary evidence that a subgroup of patients with signs of nerve 
root compression along with peripheralization of symptoms or a positive crossed straight leg 
raise will benefit from intermittent lumbar traction in the prone position. There is moderate 
evidence that clinicians should not utilize intermittent or static lumbar traction for reducing 
symptoms in patients with acute or sub acute, non-radicular low back pain or for patients 
with chronic low back pain.
PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
Education and advice have been traditional interventions given to patients with acute, sub-
acute, and chronic low back pain. A survey of recognized clinical specialists in orthopaedic 
physical therapy identified the patient education strategies of “Educate patient in home care 
treatment program” and “Recommends strategies to prevent recurrent problems” ranked as 
Delitto et al.

the highest two out of a list of 12 intervention strategies.211 In addition, “Functional 
movement training/re-education” was ranked as a “very important strategy” for therapists to 
implement in their plan of care for patients.211
Research in patient education and counseling strategies has focused on three main 
approaches, 1) general education and advice in acute and sub-acute populations, 2) 
behavioral education; including cognitive-behavioral theory, graded activity, and graded 
exposure, in a variety of populations, and 3) education of patients on the physiology of pain.
Patient education has long been considered a standard of care for the treatment of patients 
with acute low back pain. Guidelines generally recommend clinicians to counsel their 
patients to 1) remain active, 2) avoid bed rest, and 3) acknowledge the positive natural 
history of acute low back pain. For example, the joint guidelines for the Diagnosis and 
Treatment of Low Back Pain from the American College of Physicians and the American 
Pain Society state “Clinicians should provide patients with evidence-based information on 
low back pain with regard to their expected course, advise patients to remain active, and 
provide information about effective self-care options (strong recommendation, moderate-
quality evidence).”54 Several other systematic reviews have demonstrated moderate evidence 
for advising patients to remain active, as compared to bed rest, for the best opportunity for 
pain reduction and functional improvements.74, 129, 151
In 2007 Liddle et al192 published a systematic review on advice for the management of low 
back pain. Major findings state that general instructions to remain active are sufficient for 
patients with acute low back pain. More involved education relating to appropriate exercise 
and functional activities to promote active self-management is effective in patients with sub-
acute and chronic low back pain.
Burton et al37 completed a randomized controlled trial (n=162) exploring the efficacy of a 
novel educational booklet compared with a traditional booklet in patients with low back pain 
being seen in a primary care setting. Traditional information and advice about back pain has 
been based on a biomedical model with emphasis on anatomy, biomechanics, and pathology. 
The novel education booklet deemphasized education on pathology and disease processes, 
provided reassurance regarding the likelihood of recovery, and promoted positive attitudes. 
The novel education booklet resulted in significantly greater early improvement in beliefs 
that were maintained at 1 year. For patients that had elevated fear avoidance beliefs there 
was a clinically important improvement in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire at 3 
months.
Coudeyre et al69 demonstrated in a large, non-randomized controlled trial that utilization of 
pamphlet education was effective in reducing persistent low back pain and increasing patient 
satisfaction. Days of work missed, disability as measured by the Quebec Disability Scale, 
and fear-avoidance beliefs did not differ between the between the groups the that received or 
did not received the educational pamphlet.
Albaladeajo et al4 completed a three armed, clustered, randomized trial comparing three 
educational packages to 348 patients with low back pain, of which 265 (79.8%) had chronic 
low back pain. All patients received usual care administered by primary care physicians.

One group received a booklet and brief education on health education that focused on 
nutrition. The two other groups received a booklet and brief education on active 
managements of low back pain. A third group also received four sessions of physiotherapy 
for an establishment of a home exercise program. At the 6 month follow-up both groups 
receiving the active management education had small but statistically significant reduced 
disability and pain, and improved quality of life and mental quality of life scores. Scores in 
the education and exercise group at the 6 month follow-up were consistently better than the 
education alone group but the differences were not significant.
Uderman and colleagues290 completed a prospective trial of the effect of an educational 
booklet on a sample of patients with chronic low back pain (mean 10.4 years). Patients were 
given educational literature on how to manage their back pain and completed a one week 
follow-up test on content and beliefs. At nine and 18 months there were statistically 
significant reductions in pain and frequency of low back pain episodes. Due to the study 
design, it is impossible to conclude the observed effects are as a result of the intervention; 
however, given the chronic nature of the patient population, it is less likely results are due to 
natural history of the disorder.
Behavioral education, also known as cognitive behavioral theory, encompasses many aspects 
of patient education and counseling for patients with low back pain,36, 31 including:
•
Activity pacing
•
Attention diversion
•
Cognitive restructuring
•
Goal setting
•
Graded exposure
•
Motivational enhancement therapy
•
Maintenance strategies
•
Problem-solving strategies
Several aspects of behavioral education and counseling are utilized in physical therapy 
practice.255 Henschke et al,144 in a recent Cochrane Review, concluded there is moderate 
quality evidence that operant therapy and behavioral therapy are more effective than waiting 
list or usual care for short term pain relief in patients with chronic low back pain, but no 
specific type of behavioral therapy is superior than another. In the intermediate to long term, 
there is no established difference between behavioral therapy and group exercise for 
management of pain or depressive symptoms in patients with chronic low back pain.
Godges et al123 completed a controlled trial specifically looking at the treatment of 36 
patients with occupational related acute low back pain with elevated fear avoidance beliefs. 
All subjects received standard physical therapy including strengthening and ergonomic 
exercise, with half of the workers additionally receiving ongoing education and counseling 
emphasizing the positive natural history of low back pain and that activity helps to decrease 
the duration of complaints. Results demonstrated that all workers in the education group

returned to work within 45 days compared to the control group, in which one third of 
workers did not return to work at the 45 day mark. This study provides further evidence for 
the effectiveness of education and counseling for patients with low back pain with elevated 
fear avoidance beliefs.
Another patient education and counseling model that has been presented in the literature is 
based on the philosophy of helping a patient to understand their symptoms. In this patient 
education model there is a distinction between an anatomy lecture (on spinal structures) 
versus the neurophysiologic processes involved in the perception of back pain.
Moseley et al216 assessed the efficacy of pain education against traditional back anatomy 
and physiology education. Subjects were randomized to treatment groups and assessed 
fifteen days post intervention. At follow-up, the pain physiology group demonstrated 
statistically significant improvements in disability, pain catastrophization, pain beliefs, 
straight leg raise, and forward bending as compared to control. Similar results were 
demonstrated by Moseley in a shorter follow-up of immediately following education 
interventions.215 Changes in physical function as assessed by the straight leg raise and 
forward bending were found to be highly correlated to changes in pain beliefs.
Clinicians should not utilize patient education and counseling strategies that either directly 
or indirectly increase the perceived threat or fear associated with low back pain, such as 
education and counseling strategies that 1) promote extended bed-rest or 2) provide in-depth, 
pathoanatomical explanations for the causes of low back pain. Patient education and 
counseling strategies for patients with low back pain should emphasize 1) the promotion of 
the understanding of the anatomical/structural strength inherent in the human spine, 2) the 
neuroscience that explains pain perception, 3) the overall favorable prognosis of low back 
pain, 4) the use of active pain coping strategies that decrease fear and catastrophizing, 5) the 
early resumption of normal or vocational activities, even when still experiencing pain, and 6) 
the importance of improvement in activity levels, not just pain relief.
PROGRESSIVE ENDURANCE EXERCISE AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES
Presently, most national guidelines for patients with chronic low back pain endorse 
progressive aerobic exercise with moderate to high recommendations.3, 18, 54, 210, 237, 261 
High intensity exercise has also been demonstrated to have a positive effect on patients with 
chronic low back pain.45, 66, 220, 242–244, 271, 273 The samples of these studies included 
patients with long term duration of symptoms, that were primarily confined to the 
lumbopelvic region without generalized pain complaints.
Patients with low back pain and related generalized pain are believed to have increased 
neural sensitivity to afferent stimuli, including proprioception and movement. This 
sensitizing process has been termed central sensitivity.43, 224, 315 Along with underlying 
psychosocial factors, deficits in aerobic fitness88, 155, 270, 294, 317 and tissue deconditioning, 
this sensitizing process is believed to impact a person’s functional status and pain 
perception. Aerobic fitness has been hypothesized to be an important component of reducing 
pain and improving/maintaining function of these patients.

Findings in patients with generalized pain complaints have demonstrated altered central pain 
processing, supporting that these patients should be managed at lower intensity levels of 
training.223, 224 Endurance exercise has been demonstrated to have a positive effect on 
global wellbeing (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.13–0.75), physical functioning (SMD 0.68 95% CI:
0.41–0.95), and pain (SMD 0.94, 95% CI:−0.15–2.03) associated with fibromyalgia 
syndrome.39 Excessively elevated levels of exercise intensity may be responsible for 
increased symptom complaints due to increases in immune activation with release of 
proinflammatory cytokines,203 blunted increases in muscular vascularity leading to 
widespread muscular ischemia,90 and inefficiencies in the endogenous opiod and adrenergic 
pain-inhibitory mechanism.277
Clinicians should consider 1) moderate to high intensity exercise for patients with chronic 
low back pain without generalized pain, and 2) incorporating progressive, low intensity, sub-
maximal fitness and endurance activities into the pain management and health promotion 
strategies for patients with chronic low back pain with generalized pain.
CLINICAL GUIDELINES: SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
Risk Factors
Current literature does not support a definitive cause for initial episodes of low back pain. 
Risk factors are multi-factorial, population specific, and only weakly associated with the 
development of low back pain.
Clinical Course
The clinical course of low back pain can be described as acute, sub acute, transient, 
recurrent, or chronic. Given the high prevalence of recurrent and chronic low back pain and 
the associated costs, clinicians should place high priority on interventions that prevent (1) 
recurrences and (2) the transition to chronic low back pain.
Diagnosis/Classification
Low back pain, without symptoms or signs of serious medical or psychological conditions, 
associated with 1) mobility impairment in the thoracic, lumbar, or sacroiliac regions, 2) 
referred or radiating pain into a lower extremity, and 3) generalized pain are useful clinical 
findings for classifying a patient with low back pain into the following International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) categories: low 
back pain, lumbago, lumbosacral segmental/somatic dysfunction, low back strain, spinal 
instabilities, flatback syndrome, lumbago due to displacement of intervertebral disc, 
lumbago with sciatica, and the associated International Classification of Functioning, 
Disability, and Health (ICF) impairment-based category of low back pain (b28013 Pain in 
back, b28018 Pain in body part, specified as pain in buttock, groin, and thigh) and the 
following, corresponding impairments of body function:
Acute or sub acute low back pain with mobility deficits (b7101 Mobility of several 
joints)

•
High scores on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and cognitive processes consistent 
with individuals with high helplessness, rumination, or pessimism about low back 
pain
The ICD diagnosis of low back pain/low back strain/lumbago and the associated ICF 
diagnosis of chronic low back pain with related generalized pain is made with a 
reasonable level of certainty when the patient presents with the following clinical findings:
•
Low back and/or low back-related lower extremity pain with symptom duration for 
> 3 months
•
Generalized pain not consistent with other impairment-based classification criteria 
presented in this clinical guideline
•
Presence of depression, fear-avoidance beliefs, and/or pain catastrophizing
Differential Diagnosis
Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications associated with serious medical 
conditions or psychosocial factors and initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner 
when (1) the patient’s clinical findings are suggestive of serious medical or psychological 
pathology, (2) the reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure 
are not consistent with those presented in the diagnosis/classification section of this 
guideline, or (3) when the patient’s symptoms are not resolving with interventions aimed at 
normalization of the patient’s impairments of body function.
Examination – Outcome Measures
Clinicians should use validated self-report questionnaires, such as the Oswestry Disability 
Index and the Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire. These tools are useful for identifying 
a patient’s baseline status relative to pain, function, and disability and for monitoring a 
change in patient’s status throughout the course of treatment.
Examination – Activity Limitation and Participation Restriction Measures
Clinicians should routinely assess activity limitation and participation restriction through 
validated self-report or performance based measures. Changes in the patient’s level of 
activity limitation and participation restriction should be monitored with these same 
measures over the course of treatment.
Interventions – Manual Therapy
Clinicians should consider utilizing thrust manipulative procedures to reduce pain and 
disability in patients with mobility deficits and acute low back and back-related buttock or 
thigh pain. Thrust manipulative and non-thrust mobilization procedures can also be used to 
improve spine and hip mobility and reduce pain and disability in patients with sub acute and 
chronic low back and back-related lower extremity pain.

Interventions – Trunk Coordination, Strengthening and Endurance Exercises
Clinicians should consider utilizing trunk coordination, strengthening, and endurance 
exercises to reduce low back pain and disability in patients with sub acute and chronic low 
back pain with movement coordination impairments and in patients post lumbar 
microdiscectomy.
Interventions – Centralization and Directional Preference Exercises and Procedures
Clinicians should consider utilizing repeated movements, exercises, or procedures to 
promote centralization to reduce symptoms in patients with acute low back pain with related 
(referred) lower extremity pain. Clinicians should consider using repeated exercises in a 
specific direction determined by treatment response to improve mobility and reduce 
symptoms in patients with acute or sub acute low back pain with mobility deficits.
Interventions – Flexion Exercises
Clinicians can consider flexion exercises, combined with other interventions such as manual 
therapy, strengthening exercises, nerve mobilization procedures, and progressive walking for 
reducing pain and disability in older patients with chronic low back pain with radiating pain.
Interventions – Lower Quarter Nerve Mobilization Procedures
Clinicians should consider utilizing lower quarter nerve mobilization procedures to reduce 
pain and disability in patients with sub acute and chronic low back pain and radiating pain.
Interventions – Traction
There is conflicting evidence for the efficacy of intermittent lumbar traction for patients with 
low back pain. There is preliminary evidence that a subgroup of patients with signs of nerve 
root compression along with peripheralization of symptoms or a positive crossed straight leg 
raise will benefit from intermittent lumbar traction in the prone position. There is moderate 
evidence that clinicians should not utilize intermittent or static lumbar traction for reducing 
symptoms in patients with acute or sub acute, non-radicular low back pain or for patients 
with chronic low back pain.
Interventions – Patient Education and Counseling
Clinicians should not utilize patient education and counseling strategies that either directly 
or indirectly increase the perceived threat or fear associated with low back pain, such as 
education and counseling strategies that 1) promote extended bed-rest or 2) provide in-depth, 
pathoanatomical explanations for the causes of low back pain. Patient education and 
counseling strategies for patients with low back pain should emphasize 1) the promotion of 
the understanding of the anatomical/structural strength inherent in the human spine, 2) the 
neuroscience that explains pain perception, 3) the overall favorable prognosis of low back 
pain, 4) the use of active pain coping strategies that decrease fear and catastrophizing, 5) the 
early resumption of normal or vocational activities, even when still experiencing pain, and 6) 
the importance of improvement in activity levels, not just pain relief.

Interventions – Progressive Endurance Exercise and Fitness Activities
Clinicians should consider 1) moderate to high intensity exercise for patients with chronic 
low back pain without generalized pain, and 2) incorporating progressive, low intensity, sub-
maximal fitness and endurance activities into the pain management and health promotion 
strategies for patients with chronic low back pain with generalized pain.
