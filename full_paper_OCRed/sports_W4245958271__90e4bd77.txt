Introduction
Serum calcium and phosphate concentrations are
maintained in narrow ranges, indicating that they are
regulated through hormonal mechanisms. This has
been amply documented in the case of serum calcium
concentration. Calcium-sensing receptors in the
parathyroid glands sense changes in serum calcium
and modulate the secretion of parathyroid hormone
(PTH), the main calcium-regulating hormone (1).
PTH, in turn, regulates serum calcium by enhancing
osteoclastic bone resorption through osteoblastic
cells in bone, increasing renal tubular reabsorption
of calcium in the kidney, and controlling 1,25-dihy-
droxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D) production (2). In con-
trast, although both PTH and 1,25(OH)2D can affect
serum phosphate, it has been unclear how serum
phosphate is maintained, since PTH secretion is
mainly regulated by serum calcium (1).
X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia
(XLH), tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), and auto-
somal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets/osteo-
malacia (ADHR) share common clinical features,
including hypophosphatemia due to renal phosphate
wasting and impaired mineralization of bone (3).
Because serum calcium and PTH are usually normal
in patients with these diseases, the presence of a
phosphaturic humoral factor named phosphatonin
has been postulated (3, 4). Recent investigations of
ADHR and TIO implicated FGF23 in the causation
of these diseases (5–9). Continuous exposure to
recombinant FGF23 reproduced hypophosphatemic
osteomalacia and inappropriately low serum
1,25(OH)2D (6, 10). The mutant form of FGF23 that
derives from the causative missense mutations of
ADHR was shown to be resistant to proteolytic pro-
cessing that converts the biologically functional full-
length polypeptide into inactive fragments (7, 8).
Furthermore, the elevated circulatory FGF23 levels
were demonstrated not only in patients with TIO but

Inorganic phosphate is essential for ECM mineralization and also as a constituent of important
molecules in cellular metabolism. Investigations of several hypophosphatemic diseases indicated
that a hormone-like molecule probably regulates serum phosphate concentration. FGF23 has
recently been recognized as playing important pathophysiological roles in several hypophos-
phatemic diseases. We present here the evidence that FGF23 is a physiological regulator of serum
phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D) by generating FGF23-null mice. Disruption
of the Fgf23 gene did not result in embryonic lethality, although homozygous mice showed severe
growth retardation with abnormal bone phenotype and markedly short life span. The Fgf23–/– mice
displayed significantly high serum phosphate with increased renal phosphate reabsorption. They
also showed an elevation in serum 1,25(OH)2D that was due to the enhanced expression of renal
25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase (1α-OHase) from 10 days of age. These phenotypes could not
be explained by currently known regulators of mineral homeostasis, indicating that FGF23 is essen-
tial for normal phosphate and vitamin D metabolism.

also in those with XLH (11, 12). These results indi-
cate that excess activity of FGF23 causes hypophos-
phatemia and impaired mineralization of bone asso-
ciated with phosphatonin. In addition, recent reports
have revealed that circulatory FGF23 could be detect-
ed in sera of normal humans (11, 12), implying the
action of FGF23 in maintaining normal mineral
homeostasis in the endocrine system. To decipher the
physiological function of FGF23, we generated and
analyzed FGF23-deficient mice.
Methods
Establishment of the FGF23-null mice. The genomic DNA
corresponding to 5.2 kb of the 5′-flanking region, a
part of exon 1, and the following 3′-intronic sequence
in the Fgf23 gene were isolated from a C57BL/6
genomic bacterial artificial chromosome library.
These DNA fragments were subcloned into 5′ and 3′
sites of a neomycin-resistance gene to construct the
targeting vector (Figure 1a). This targeting vector was
introduced into TT2 ES cells (13) by electroporation
to replace the 0.2-kb fragment of DNA of exon 1. The
transformed clones carrying a targeted allele were
selected by Southern blot analysis and microinjected
into the eight-cell embryo prepared from ICR mice.
Male chimeric mice with a germline transmission of
the targeted allele were mated with female C57BL/6
mice to generate heterozygous offspring. Homozy-
gous founders were generated by mating these het-
erozygous mice. All mice were fed with a standard
rodent chow containing 1.1% P and 1.0% Ca (CLEA
Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and tap water ad libitum. All
studies using animals were reviewed and approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
the Pharmaceutical Research Laboratories, KIRIN
Brewery Co. (Takasaki, Japan).
Soft roentgenogram of femurs. The femurs were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde and were exposed to X-rays at 0.1
mA and 25 kV for 5 seconds using µFX-1000 (Fujifilm
Co., Tokyo, Japan). The image was developed by a BAS
image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.).
Bone histology. For double-labeling analysis, 30 mg/kg
of tetracycline and then 30 mg/kg of calcein were
injected intraperitoneally with a 3-day interval between
injections. The isolated femurs were fixed and stained
with Villanueva bone stain. Tissues were then embed-
ded in a methyl methacrylate resin (Wako Pure Chem-
ical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and undecalcified
sections with 4 µm thickness were counterstained with
Villanueva-Goldner counterstain. Histomorphomet-
ric analysis was carried out by choosing 24–26 fields in
a femoral secondary cancellous bone.
Measurement of serum parameters. Blood samples were
collected from the carotid artery (day 1 and 6) or
heart (day 10 and thereafter) under anesthesia. Phos-
phate and calcium concentrations were determined
using P-test WAKO and Ca-test WAKO, respectively
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.). Serum PTH
and 1,25(OH)2D were determined by Rat Intact PTH
RIA Kit (Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, California,
USA) and RIA Kit (TFB Co., Tokyo, Japan), respec-
tively. Serum FGF23 was measured by a sandwich
ELISA (12) established for a detection of full-length
human FGF23. Immunoprecipitation followed by

Western blotting demonstrated that the two mAbs
used in this ELISA recognize mouse as well as human
FGF23. In addition, a titration curve of serial dilu-
tions of recombinant mouse FGF23 prepared by this
ELISA was virtually identical to the standard curve
produced using purified recombinant human FGF23
protein (data not shown), indicating that mouse
FGF23 is quantitatively detectable by this ELISA.
Results were expressed as values calculated from the
standard curve using human FGF23. Urine samples
were collected by rearing mice in metabolic cages
(Sugiyamagen Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 24 hours. Serum
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, glucose, blood
urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, total cholesterol,
and triglycerides were determined by using the
Hitachi 7180 autoanalyser (Hitachi High-Technolo-
gies Corp., Tokyo, Japan).
Measurement of sodium-dependent phosphate uptake activ-
ity of brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV). The BBMV
were prepared by the method previously reported (14).
The sodium-dependent phosphate uptake of the
BBMV was measured by a rapid filtration method with
several modifications (15).
Immunohistochemistry of type IIa sodium-phosphate cotrans-
porter (NaPi-2a) protein. The kidneys were fixed in 10%
paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. Sections
of 3 µm thickness were incubated with a polyclonal rab-
bit anti–mouse NaPi-2a antibody produced by immu-
nizing rabbits with the C-terminal peptide of NaPi-2a
(LALPAHHNATRL). The signals were detected by ENVI-
SION+ HRP system (DakoCytomation, Kyoto, Japan). 
Northern blotting. The DNA fragments used as
probes for all experiments were prepared from the
mouse kidney cDNA by PCR with the following

using ISOGEN reagent (Nippon Gene Co., Tokyo,
Japan). A 20-µg sample of each of the RNA samples
was electrophoresed and transferred to Hybond N+
(Amersham Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, New Jer-
sey, USA). Radiolabeled probe was prepared using
Megaprime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences
Corp.). The membrane was hybridized with the 32P-
labeled probe in PerfectHyb reagent (TOYOBO Co.,
Osaka, Japan) overnight at 65°C. Then the blot was
washed with a solution of 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS for
30 minutes at 65°C. The signals were visualized by
the BAS system (Fuji Photo Film Co.).
Results
Generation of the FGF23-null mice. Targeted ablation of the
Fgf23 gene generated heterozygotes (Fgf23+/–) and
homozygotes (Fgf23–/–) (Figure 1, a and b). Mice with
each genotype were born at the expected mendelian fre-
quency. The heterozygotes did not show significant dif-
ferences from WT mice in general appearance and
growth (Figure 1, c and d). These phenotypes are consis-
tent with the same serum level of FGF23 in heterozy-
gotes (120.1 ± 4.4 pg/ml, n = 3) at 9 weeks of age as that
of age-matched WT mice (126.0 ± 2.8 pg/ml, n = 13).
Serum FGF23 could not be detected in homozygotes at
this age, confirming a successful ablation of the Fgf23
gene (n = 7). However, marked growth retardation of
homozygotes was observed by 13 days of age and there-
after, although at birth the body size and appearance of
the Fgf23–/– mice were not different from those of WT or
heterozygous littermates (Figure 1d). Moreover, the life
span of the Fgf23–/– mice was markedly shorter than that
of either WT mice or heterozygotes (Figure 1e). The abla-
tion of FGF23 did not affect the developmental process
of any organs by birth. However, the KO mice began to
die at various ages after weaning, and no homozygotes
survived more than 13 weeks. The survival ratios
between male and female homozygous mice were not
statistically different (P = 0.1455, log rank test). An
autopsy of a 12-week-old homozygous mouse demon-
strated sparse skeletal muscle and fat tissues. Further-
more, atrophy of glomeruli and marked vascular calcifi-
cation in the kidneys, accompanied by elevated serum
BUN (88.0 mg/dl, obtained at 2 days before death) were
observed. Therefore, the impaired renal function, as one
possible reason for the short life span of the Fgf23–/– mice,
was probably due to the constantly higher serum levels
of both calcium and phosphate almost throughout the
life span, as discussed later. In addition, that the KO mice
were hypoglycemic for unknown reasons (as discussed
later) may also have contributed to the short life span.
The FGF23-null mice exhibited an obvious immatu-
rity of the reproductive organs that resulted in infertil-
ity. Severe and rapid atrophy of the thymus and reduc-
tion of the spleen cells were observed after weaning,
although these organs appeared to be normal at 3
weeks of age (data not shown). The Fgf23–/– mice also
demonstrated marked decrease in peripheral lympho-
cytes (heterozygotes, 5,455 ± 1,424 cells/µl, n = 4;
homozygotes, 833 ± 140 cells/µl, n = 4, P < 0.05).
Abnormal bone of Fgf23–/– mice. The Fgf23–/– mice
showed abnormal bone development. As shown in
Figure 2a, the femurs isolated from 7-week-old
Fgf23–/– mice were very short, and the soft X-ray
images of cortical bone demonstrated a marked
reduction in mineral content. However, bone diame-
ter was disproportionately wide and the epiphysis rel-
atively large. Histological analysis revealed that the
femurs isolated from 2-week-old homozygous mice
appeared to be normal when the growth retardation
became obvious (Figure 2, b and c). In contrast, in 7-
week-old Fgf23–/– mice, the growth plate was severely
disorganized and hypertrophic chondrocytes were
not observed. In addition, a marked accumulation of
unmineralized osteoids was seen in cortical bone and
secondary spongiosa (Figure 2, b and c). Similar accu-
mulation of osteoid was seen in tibia and calvarial
bone (data not shown). Table 1 summarizes the
results of bone histomorphometry in femoral sec-
ondary cancellous bones at 7 weeks of age. The min-
eralized bone volume/tissue volume ratio (mBV/TV)
significantly decreased in the KO mice, although the

bone volume/tissue volume ratio (BV/TV) was not
statistically changed. There were fewer trabeculae
present than in normal littermates, while the trabec-
ular thickness was relatively greater as a result of
osteoid accumulation. The osteoid volume, thick-
ness, and surface area were markedly increased in the
Fgf23–/– mice. Both osteoblast and osteoclast surface
areas were markedly reduced in the null mice, indi-
cating that bone turnover was suppressed. The dou-
ble-labeling analysis failed to determine the parame-
ters for mineralization because of an absence of the
labeled mineralization surface in the null mice. None
of the parameters that we examined were statistical-
ly different between WT and heterozygous mice. 
Serum parameters in the Fgf23–/– mice. We had previous-
ly reported that administration of FGF23 reproduced
the typical features of TIO including hypophos-
phatemia and low serum 1,25(OH)2D (6). In contrast,
the Fgf23–/– mice showed significant elevations of serum
phosphate, calcium, and 1,25(OH)2D (Figure 3). Serum
phosphate concentrations were significantly elevated
from day 10 after birth, and those elevations were main-
tained at least up to 9 weeks of age. Serum 1,25(OH)2D
of the KO mice also began to increase at day 10. At this
point, serum FGF23 was detected in WT and in het-
erozygous mice (WT, 186.4 ± 14.1 pg/ml, n = 10; het-
erozygotes; 205.5 ± 21.3 pg/ml, n = 9) but not in KO
mice (n = 5). Although FGF23 protein (10–61 pg/ml)
was detected in breast milk collected from the female
heterozygous mice nursing homozygous pups, it was
not sufficient to compensate for the lack of serum
FGF23 to rescue the phenotypes in the Fgf23–/– mice.
Elevation of serum calcium observed from 2 weeks after
birth was modest but significant. Serum PTH of the
FGF23-null mice were significantly decreased at 6 or 9
weeks of age, but not at 10 days or 2 weeks. This
decrease in PTH may be at least in part due to the
increased serum calcium and 1,25(OH)2D. The FGF23-
null mice exhibited significant increases in serum ALP
activities. The marked elevation was already observed at
2 weeks and was maintained at 6 weeks (Table 2). Hypo-
glycemia was observed from 2 weeks of age and became
remarkable at 3 weeks and afterward (Table 2). In addi-
tion, serum total cholesterol was increased and triglyc-
erides were decreased (Table 2). Heterozygotes did not
show any changes in serum parameters examined in
comparison with those of WT mice.
Altered expressions of key molecules for mineral homeostasis.
Serum 1,25(OH)2D is mainly determined by activities of
the renal enzymes 1α−OHase, which increases the
serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D, and 24-OHase,
which metabolizes and decreases serum 1,25(OH)2D
(16). To seek an explanation for the high serum
1,25(OH)2D in the FGF23-null mice, we examined the
expression of these enzymes by Northern blot. The
expression of 1α-OHase was increased in the Fgf23–/–
mice from at least day 10, when the serum 1,25(OH)2D
also started to rise, and the increased 1α-OHase mRNA
was maintained thereafter (Figure 4a). In addition, the
enhanced mRNA level of 24-OHase was also observed
at 3 weeks and thereafter in the Fgf23–/– mice (Figure 4a).
Since the increase of 24-OHase mRNA occurred at 3
weeks, when serum 1,25(OH)2D levels had already
increased, it is probable that this enhanced 24-OHase
expression was promoted by the increased 1,25(OH)2D
levels in the Fgf23–/– mice. Thus, upregulated 1α-OHase
expression seems to be the main reason for the signifi-
cant elevation of serum 1,25(OH)2D in the KO mice.
Serum phosphate level is mainly maintained by renal
phosphate reabsorption, which is regulated by the
amount of NaPi-2a in brush border membrane of the
Figure 3
Comparison of serum parameters. Blood samples were collected
from carotid artery (day 1 and 6) or heart (day 10 and thereafter)
under conditions of anesthesia. Because sufficient amounts of
blood could not be obtained from mice aged younger than 10 days,
sera were pooled in each genotype for measurement of 1,25(OH)2D.
Other results represent mean ± SEM. The numbers of mice killed at
each age were variable (average; WT n = 5, heterozygotes n = 9, and
homozygotes n = 6). Statistical analysis was carried out by Dunnett’s
method for comparison of multiple means (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01).

renal proximal tubular cells (17). Actually, 6-week-old
FGF23-KO mice demonstrated the increased tubular
maximum transport of phosphate/GFR (TmP/GFR),
suggesting that hyperphosphatemia in the Fgf23–/–
mice was due to the increased renal phosphate reab-
sorption (Figure 4b). Therefore, we analyzed the
expression of NaPi-2a to clarify the mechanism of this
enhanced renal phosphate reabsorption. Figure 4c
shows the results of immunohistochemical analysis
for NaPi-2a with kidney sections prepared from 6-week-
old mice. Despite remarkable hyperphosphatemia,
NaPi-2a protein in the KO mice was more localized to
the apical surface of proximal tubules, confirming
there was the enhanced phosphate reabsorption in
those mice. This finding was further confirmed by a
significant increase in sodium-dependent phosphate-
uptake activity of kidney BBMV in the KO mice (het-
erozygotes, 396.4 ± 88.2 pmol/mg/min, n = 5; homozy-
gotes, 632.6 ± 105.8 pmol/mg/min, n = 6, P < 0.05, at 9
weeks). PTH is known to induce renal phosphate
excretion by rapidly decreasing NaPi-2a on the apical
surface of proximal tubules (18). Therefore, it is possi-
ble that the decreased PTH level in the Fgf23–/– mice at
6–9 weeks might have contributed to the disordered
response of NaPi-2a. However, decreased PTH levels
were not observed at 10 days and 2 weeks, when hyper-
phosphatemia was already present, indicating that
suppression of PTH is not required for hyperphos-
phatemia in the FGF23-null mice. Thus, enhanced
renal phosphate reabsorption via NaPi-2a is likely to
be one of the major reasons for severe hyperphos-
phatemia in the FGF23-null mice.
Discussion
The mutant mice lacking FGF23 exhibited severe
hyperphosphatemia, with enhanced renal phosphate
reabsorption and high serum 1,25(OH)2D. In addi-
tion, these phenotypes are the mirror images of those
in previously reported animal studies in which admin-
istration of FGF23 caused hypophosphatemia and low
serum 1,25(OH)2D (6, 7, 10). In contrast, heterozy-
gotes showed no abnormality in any of the parameters
examined, including serum FGF23. These results clear-
ly indicate that production and serum concentrations
of FGF23 are tightly regulated and that this regulato-
ry mechanism can compensate for the absence of one
allele of the Fgf23 gene, although the precise source
and mechanism of regulation of FGF23 production
are not sufficiently clear. Therefore, it is suggested that
FGF23 is acting physiologically to reduce serum phos-
phate and 1,25(OH)2D levels.
Renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is stimulated by
PTH and hypophosphatemia, and inhibited by
1,25(OH)2D and hypercalcemia (16, 19, 20). The
Fgf23–/– mice showed hyperphosphatemia, hypercal-
cemia, high serum 1,25(OH)2D, and suppressed PTH,
all of which have been described to suppress

1,25(OH)2D production. However, the KO mice
showed sustained elevation of 1α-OHase expression
and high 1,25(OH)2D levels at least from 10 days of
age. On the contrary, our preliminary experiment
demonstrated that injecting recombinant FGF23 into
the Fgf23–/– mice resulted in a significant reduction in
serum 1,25(OH)2D within 8 hours (untreated WT
mice, 152.1 ± 17.9 pg/ml; untreated homozygotes,
707.6 ± 258.2 pg/ml; FGF23-treated homozygotes,
79.9 ± 9.0 pg/ml). Therefore, it is likely that FGF23 is
physiologically suppressing the renal 1α-OHase ex-
pression cooperating or competing with several hu-
moral factors such as PTH and 1,25(OH)2D itself.
Although we were unable to evaluate the serum
1,25(OH)2D in homozygotes at 6 days of age because
there were insufficient sera available for the measure-
ment, we could detect circulatory FGF23 in 6-day-old
WT mice (154.2 ± 22.3 pg/ml, n = 4). Because hyper-
phosphatemia of the KO mice first appeared at 10 days
after birth and other phenotypes at later times, FGF23
seems to be less important in newborn mice and the
FGF23-independent phosphate-handling mechanism
is probably dominant at this stage.
One possibility is that the regulatory mechanism of
intestinal and renal phosphate handling is immature and
rather insensitive to hormone-dependent changes of
phosphate influx and efflux. The other possibility is that
another phosphate-regulatory factor present in milk
plays a dominant role in regulating serum phosphate.
Because excess actions of FGF23 result in rickets/
osteomalacia, it was surprising that the Fgf23–/– mice
also exhibited the disorganized growth plate and accu-
mulation of osteoid in cortical and calvarial bones.
Although the precise mechanism of this abnormal
bone development is not clear at the moment, the ele-
vated serum 1,25(OH)2D may have contributed to
these changes. The increase of osteoid has been report-
ed in the 24-OHase–deficient mice that demonstrated
marked elevation of 1,25(OH)2D (21). The other possi-
ble reason for the abnormal bone development may be
a decreased PTH level. PTH is a potent anabolic factor
for bone formation, and its absence is known to sup-
press bone turnover (22). The significant reductions in
both osteoblast and osteoclast surface areas in the KO
mice may be caused by the deficient PTH action. How-
ever, increased osteoid cannot be explained by sup-
pressed turnover of bone. In contrast, it is possible that
FGF23 has a direct action on bone metabolism. Actu-
ally, a recent report showed expression of FGF23 in
bone, suggesting an unknown function of FGF23 in
bone metabolism (23). Additional studies, such as an
investigation of the receptor and the signaling pathway,
will be necessary to clarify these issues.
It has been reported that administration of
1,25(OH)2D3 induces a positive balance of phosphate
and calcium (16). A recent report has shown that
expression of intestinal type IIb sodium-dependent
phosphate cotransporter, which is thought to be
involved in active phosphate transport in the intestine,
can be regulated by 1,25(OH)2D (24). Thus, increased
serum 1,25(OH)2D may have contributed to hyper-
phosphatemia in the Fgf23–/– mice, at least in part. In
addition, the FGF23-null mice demonstrated en-
hanced renal phosphate-uptake activities and more
restricted distribution of NaPi-2a on the apical side of
the proximal tubule, which should be downregulated
in the presence of hyperphosphatemia in normal ani-
mals (25). Bai et al. have reported that continuous
administration of FGF23 induced the downregulation
of NaPi-2a (10), and we have also observed the
decreased NaPi-2a expression at 8–13 hours after a sin-
gle injection of FGF23 into WT mice (26). Further-
more, 2-week-old Fgf23–/– mutant mice showed normal
BUN levels compared with those of control littermates
(WT, 18.6 ± 1.6 mg/dl, n = 3; heterozygotes, 19.9 ± 1.3
mg/dl, n = 3; homozygotes, 22.6 ± 2.2 mg/dl, n = 4),
while homozygous mice by that age had already demon-
strated significant hyperphosphatemia (Figure 3).
Therefore, these results indicate that physiological
response to hyperphosphatemia is abolished in the
Fgf23–/– mice and demonstrate the essential role of
FGF23 in the regulation of renal phosphate reabsorp-
tion. Although the extremely small body size of Fgf23–/–
mice did not allow us to analyze the effect of parathy-
roidectomy on serum phosphate, our previous study
demonstrated that FGF23 is able to reduce serum
phosphate levels in parathyroidectomized animals
(26). In addition, hyperphosphatemia of the KO mice
observed at 10 days and 2 weeks after birth was asso-
ciated with normal serum PTH levels. These results
indicate that hyperphosphatemia of the KO mice is
induced by a PTH-independent mechanism.
In contrast, it remains unclear whether FGF23 plays
important roles in other physiological events besides
mineral homeostasis. When we fed the Fgf23–/– mice
with a low-phosphate diet (Pi 0.2%, Ca 0.5%) from just
after weaning (4 weeks, n = 6), 50% of homozygous mice
survived more than 13 weeks. However, these mice with
prolonged life span still demonstrated severe growth
retardation (7.4–12.4 g body weight), hypoglycemia,
and elevated 1,25(OH)2D (670.1 ± 108.8 pg/ml), al-
though serum phosphate was successfully decreased
(5.8 ± 2.3 mg/dl). Thus, hyperphosphatemia itself is
not sufficient to result in these phenotypes of the null
mice. Atrophy of thymus and spleen became apparent
only after weaning in FGF23-null mice. These results
suggest that metabolic changes such as hyperphos-
phatemia and high serum 1,25(OH)2D, rather than the
deficiency of FGF23 itself, are responsible for abnor-
malities in lymphocytes. Actually, 1,25(OH)2D has been
reported to be a potent regulator of the immune sys-
tem. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the
abnormalities in these tissues of FGF23-null mice.
In summary, here we have clarified the essential roles
of FGF23 in the physiological regulation of phosphate
and vitamin D metabolism. These findings provide
new insights for the understanding of bone and min-
eral metabolism. Additional studies using these Fgf23–/–

mice, together with exploration of the receptor for
FGF23 and of the tissues responsible for FGF23 pro-
duction should more precisely decipher the physiolog-
ical significance of FGF23.
