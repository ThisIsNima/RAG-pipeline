English with an Accent 
Since its initial publication, English with an Accent has provoked debate and controversy 
within classrooms through its in-depth scrutiny of American attitudes toward language. 
Rosina Lippi-Green discusses the ways in which discrimination based on accent functions 
to support and perpetuate social structures and unequal power relations. 
This second edition has been reorganized and revised to include: 
new dedicated chapters on Latino English and Asian American English 
discussion questions, further reading, and suggested classroom exercises 
updated examples from the classroom, the judicial system, the media, and corporate 
culture 
a discussion of the long-term implications of the Ebonics debate 
a brand-new companion website with an interactive bibliography, glossary of key 
terms, and links to audio, video, and images relevant to each chapter’s content, 
available at: www.routledge.com/cw/lippi-green. 
English with an Accent is essential reading for students with interests in attitudes and 
discrimination toward language. 
Rosina Lippi-Green is an independent scholar and award-winning writer of ﬁction. She 
holds a PhD in linguistics from Princeton University, USA, and was a University of 
Michigan, Ann Arbor faculty member for ten years.

“This second edition of English with an Accent exceeds the high standard of research 
excellence that Lippi-Green ﬁrst displayed in 1997. This new book introduces keen 
insights about language, justice, discrimination, and the human condition in 
America.” 
John Baugh, Margaret Bush Wilson Professor in Arts and Sciences, Washington University 
in St. Louis, USA 
“English with an Accent, a powerfully penned exposition on the relation between 
language, subordination, and discrimination, was already insightful and thought-
provoking when it ﬁrst appeared in 1997. This updated and expanded second edition 
has made it absolutely invaluable, and I can’t wait to use it in my classes. It represents 
sociolinguistics at its best – theoretically informed, but decidedly applied as well, 
implicating race relations, immigration, social class, education, politics, immigration, 
and more. It is impossible to read this book and not be troubled by prejudices and 
practices that we didn’t notice or consider problematic before.” 
John R. Rickford, J.E. Wallace Sterling Professor of Linguistics and the Humanities, 
Stanford University, USA 
“This new edition breaks new ground again, providing updates related to politics, 
internet usage, and the classroom . . . It will be the go-to text for explorations of 
language and its connection to social identity, linguistic authority, and language-
based oppression. I can’t wait to use it in my courses.” 
Robin Queen, Arthur F. Thurnau Professor, University of Michigan, USA 
“English with an Accent is an encyclopedic, cutting-edge update of Lippi-Green’s 
classic text on language subordination. Hard-hitting and thought-provoking, this is 
an essential work.” 
Jane H. Hill, Regents’ Professor of Anthropology and Linguistics (Emerita), University of 
Arizona, USA

Preface1 
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not to their own facts. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan2 
By almost anybody’s modern U.S. standards, I have no accent. Because of the English I 
speak, the destructive and exclusionary practices you will read about in this book have 
never been directed at me. 
But of course, I do have an accent. My English tells anybody who wants to listen to me 
who I am: a woman of European ancestry, middle-aged, who has lived most of her life in 
the heart of the country, in the Midwest. By fortunate circumstance, I had a longer and 
more exclusive education than most people have, which has also inﬂuenced my accent – 
because it took me away from the Midwest, primarily, but also because it put me in social 
circumstances which were foreign to me, against which I struggled and will always struggle, 
even as I adjust. 
This is a written work, and so it is not by virtue of my accent but of my education that 
I am granted a voice. For that reason some would say that my authority derives exclusively 
from privilege. It is true that I cannot claim the authority of personal experience in the 
matters I am going to describe and discuss – except in the most trivial way – but I can and 
do claim the authority of careful observation and study, and of interest and participation. 
I am taking a chance. My thoughts may be dismissed, my observations put aside. In a 
time when authorial voices are questioned very closely, I have no credentials which allow 
me to speak – nor do I wish to speak – for African Americans or Asian Americans. Because 
I am not a Latina or Lakota Sioux, because I am not from Mobile, the Bronx, Bombay, 
Singapore, or Nairobi, readers may question my data before ever considering my analysis 
and conclusions. In that case, I invite them to investigate for themselves before dismissing 
what I have to say. The purpose of this study is not to answer the questions raised in a 
deﬁnitive way, but to open up a discussion and examination which has been suppressed 
for too long. 
There is another kind of chance I take here, one that is not new to me. Many people 
take strong exception to the ideas presented here. Beliefs about the way language should 
be used are passed down and protected in much the same way that religious beliefs are 
passed along and cherished. Some will call me a language anarchist and a liberal elitist; I 
know this, because I have been called such things before, and by colleagues I respect. This 
kind of reaction I take as further proof of the power of the standard language ideology 
that we are all exposed to. 
In fact, some colleagues have suggested that you, the reader, could take offense at the 
material presented here. The concern is that you may consider yourself judged and found 
lacking. My own experience tells me that most university students have more intellectual 
rigor than they are given credit for, and will at least attempt to think critically before taking 
offense. This has been borne out by research classrooms where race and conﬂict are central 
themes:

PREFACE 
The more comfortable instructors are to openly engage difficult dialogues (and not 
simply gloss over substantive issues), the more willing students are to share openly 
(Simpson et al. 2007). In addition, students are often willing to move into and through 
emotional tension when other class members move beyond blaming, condescending or 
patronizing (ibid.: 43). What we have learned generally from critical analyses of race 
(particularly whiteness) is that the analysis of student (and teacher) responses lends insight 
into the ways that whiteness is both challenged and reproduced in the everyday spaces of 
education (Cooks 2003; Johnson et al. 2008: 116; Warren 2001). 
In the hope that it will provide some perspective, this quote from Murray Rothbard, an 
economist: 
It is no crime to be ignorant of economics, which is, after all, a specialized discipline 
and one that most people consider to be a “dismal science.” But it is totally irrespon-
sible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in 
this state of ignorance. 
(Rothbard 2000: 202) 
With very few adjustments, this quote applies also to the study of language and linguistics. 
The primary difference is here: economics is a specialized discipline that most people consider 
“dismal science.” In fact, people are generally very interested in language. Unfortunately, 
our institutions are very good at producing citizens who truly believe that they understand 
the inner workings of language, and that their understanding is enough to justify not only 
vociferous opinions but also to act on those opinions in ways that sometimes will be 
detrimental and even destructive to others. To put this another way: for the most part, 
the public does not see the difference between opinion and fact when it comes to language. 
Part of what I hope to accomplish here is to make the difference visible. 
Of course, this text is not simply a list of facts. I cannot claim that this work is no more 
than a neutral presentation of observations about language. Where the facts end, 
interpretation and analysis begin and questions are raised which have consequence in the 
real world. My opinions are informed by careful thought and by research, but they are 
opinions. You are, of course, entitled – and encouraged – to disagree. I am not offended 
by disagreement; I do not equate it with personal animosity. 
To be clear, I would summarize my stance with two general statements: 
There is something deeply inequitable and unacceptable about the practice of exclud-
ing the few from the privileges of the many not on the basis of what they have to say, 
but how they say it. 
The demand that the disempowered assimilate linguistically and culturally to please 
the empowered is – purely in linguistic terms – an impossibility. For that reason, such 
demands are misleading, unreasonable and demeaning. 
There is a challenge here for the reader. Can you be objective about language? Can you 
examine what you think you know about your own language? And more difﬁcult, are you 
willing to explore why you may be so very protective of common sense arguments about 
language which have no demonstrable basis in fact? 
This book is about reluctance to acknowledge language for the social construct that it 
is, and the repercussions of such resistance. When I use this book as a classroom text,

sooner or later someone asks me what I hope to accomplish. I can say with complete 
honesty that I have no illusions about saving the world or initiating an era of universal 
linguistic goodwill. 
Walt Wolfram’s version of this same question requires more thought. He asks: 
What approaches to the dissemination of sociolinguistic information must be adopted 
with communities and with the general public when language diversity is interpreted 
in terms of a prescriptive, correctionist model? 
(Wolfram et al. 2008) 
This issue has been debated and will continue to be debated as long as there is life and 
movement in the discipline. That is good and right, because it is an important question. 
In the published work on this matter there are three principles that make sense to me: 
1  
Principle of error correction: “A scientist who becomes aware of a widespread idea or 
social practice with important consequences that is invalidated by his own data is 
obligated to bring this error to the attention of the widest possible audience” (Labov 
1982: 172). 
2  
Principle of debt incurred: “An investigator who has obtained linguistic data from 
members of a speech community has an obligation to use the knowledge based on 
that data for the beneﬁt of the community, when [the community] has need of it” 
(ibid.: 173). 
3  
Principle of linguistic gratuity: the obligation to “pursue positive ways in which 
[linguists] can return linguistic favors to the [ﬁeldwork] community” (Wolfram 1993: 
227; see also Wolfram et al. 2008). 
In so far as teaching is concerned, Wolfram concludes that: 
[W]hile it is relatively easy to capitalize on people’s inherent interest in language, it 
is sometimes difﬁcult to convince the general public to accept the need for language 
study, a prerequisite to changing uninformed opinions and assumptions about lan-
guage variation. 
(Wolfram et al. 2008: 1113) 
One fall while I was teaching what was my signature course, Language & Discrimination, 
I had an unusual conversation with a student. He asked a question that took some courage. 
“Okay,” he said in class discussion. “I resisted, but I can see now that my reactions to 
certain kinds of errors [sic] are not based on fact but on ideology and emotion. Knowing 
that, I can still discriminate on the basis of language. I’m within my rights doing that. 
Right?” 
To which there was only one response: of course. In so far as his behavior stays within 
the parameters of the law (he couldn’t refuse employment to someone because of an Irish 
or Indonesian accent, for example), he was free to do as he wished. My hope was that he 
ﬁnished the book (and the course) with a wider understanding and perspective, so that he 
didn’t rationalize his choices to himself or anyone else. 
I hope that and more for everyone who comes across this book. I hope too that when 
others try to use language ideology to silence you, your family, your community, you will 
hear Eleanor Roosevelt reminding you: no one can make you feel inferior without your consent. 
And then you will speak up out of conviction, but armed with facts.

Notes 
1 
Since the ﬁrst edition of English with an Accent appeared in 1997, linguists (along with 
colleagues in anthropology, psychology, education, media studies and other disciplines) 
have produced a great deal of work on the linguistic, sociocultural and ideological 
aspects of English as it evolves and changes. Between 1999 and 2010 I added more 
than eight hundred books, chapters, articles, essays, newspaper reports, court cases, 
and government documents to my bibliography. I have never lacked for reading 
material. 
As a result, pretty much every sentence in EWA had to be rewritten, every source 
checked, reevaluated, replaced or brought up to date, and every conclusion challenged. 
The process was not an easy or pretty one, but I hope the results make EWA more 
relevant and useful, and that it will continue to work well for those who use it as a class-
room text. I also hope that the people who are responsible for this great smörgåsbord 
of information will understand I just couldn’t ﬁt everything in. That has nothing to do 
with a lack of interest, but only restrictions on time and space.

it is attributed at various points to Senator Moynhan and to Senator Simpson.

Introduction 
Language ideology or science fiction? 
The American ideal, after all, is that everyone should be as much alike as possible. 
James Baldwin, Notes of a Native Son (1984: 64) 
If we choose, we can live in a world of comforting illusion. 
Noam Chomsky (http://tinyurl.com/4q7eej4) 
This book is about language, but let’s begin with a bit of science fiction. Imagine the 
following: 
On January 1 of the next new year, each person residing in the United States wakes 
up to find themselves physically transformed: regardless of race or ethnicity, all adult 
males 18 and older will be exactly 6' tall and weigh 175 pounds; adult females, 5'9", at 
140 pounds. All persons will show exactly the same physical measurements (length of 
tibia, diameter of wrist) and body fat ratios, with a differential arising from gender-speciﬁc 
roles in the propagation of the species. All persons newborn through age 17 will approach 
the adult model on a scale graduated exactly to age. Metabolism has adjusted so that 
the ratios of height to weight are maintained regardless of diet or development of 
musculature. 
Let’s take this strange idea a step further and imagine what this revolution would mean 
to us in our day-to-day lives. Some of the repercussions might be seen as positive: 
Tremendous behavior shifts in matters of mate selection and sexuality. Every woman 
will wear what is now a size ten, but as sizes are no longer relevant or meaningful, the 
social connotations of clothing sizes (petite or queen, extra tall, extra long, extra broad, 
extra narrow) will quickly be lost. 
The end of the diet industry. 
Sudden resolution of health problems related to weight. Heart disease, hypertension, 
anorexia – a whole range of difﬁcult health problems greatly simpliﬁed or resolved 
overnight. 
Dramatic changes in the way we think about food. As metabolism is now ﬁne-tuned 
to deal with excessive or insufﬁcient calories, carbohydrate and fat intake, much of 
the culture and psychology about eating would evolve in new directions. 
Revolution in the design and manufacture of easy chairs, roller-skates, toothbrushes, 
gloves, skis, kitchen counters, bathtubs, lawnmower handles, car seats, bed sheets, 
violins, submarines, auditoriums, coffins and everything else which now makes 
allowance for variation in physical size. This would mean a tremendous econo-
mic advantage for businesses which can streamline production in ways never 
imagined.

INTRODUCTION 
Sports, professional and otherwise, would change greatly. But because muscle tone, 
agility, speed, and strength would remain matters of life style, nutrition, and training, 
sports as we know them would not disappear, but shift in focus and nature. 
These are just a few areas which would be changed. The list can easily be expanded as we 
anticipate the major social and cultural impact on our lives. 
When I discuss this ﬁctional United States with my classes, the students are eager to 
list things that would be easier, cheaper, more streamlined and efﬁcient if this physical 
world were suddenly to become a reality. Slowly, different considerations begin to emerge, 
which students are sometimes reluctant to express. They have to do with issues which are 
more subtle, which touch on identity and self-awareness, aesthetic and value systems. It 
sounds like this would be a good thing overall, for us as a country, says one student. But 
my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather were all 6'5" or bigger. With less 
of an apologetic tone, a Japanese-American woman tells the class “I can’t imagine being 
that tall.” Another student asks, “Who decided on these particular figures? Why 140 
pounds for women – wouldn’t 125 be more aesthetically pleasing?” And yet another 
comment: “Why shouldn’t men and women be the same height?” 
Before I let the class discuss these questions in any depth, there is one more step in the 
science ﬁction fantasy which we must consider. 
Imagine now that this unanticipated and unwilled transformation does not take place. 
Instead, a junior Congresswoman rises before the House of Representatives and she 
presents a precise, well-written proposal for a law which dictates the physical world 
imagined above, in which a woman who is 6'2" or a man who weighs 225 pounds are either 
violating federal law willfully, or must be labeled handicapped. 
In support of her proposal, the Congresswoman outlines the many social ills which 
will be instantaneously fixed, and the economic advantages for the manufacturing and 
business communities. She provides projections which promise that billions of dollars 
will be saved if this law is put into effect, money which can be put into education and 
job training. Her presentation includes complex essays and calculations by a panel of 
experts who have, on the basis of considerable study, determined what ideal heights 
and weights must be – what makes a superior, efficient, aesthetically pleasing human 
being. 
“Let us all be one height and weight,” she says. “For we are all one nation.” 
This is a funny idea; students laugh. What is wrong with it is so obvious as to be trivial, 
they tell me. 
First, we cannot all be the same height and weight and physical type: variation and 
diversity are inescapable biological facts. Thus, this law would be unenforceable. 
Second, even if this were not an impossibility, it would be wrong – an invasion of 
personal liberties – to require people to change their physical beings to approximate some 
model set up by others, in the name of perceived economic or social advance, even their 
own. 
Third: People will ﬁnd ways to differentiate themselves, to stand out, to be individuals, 
because that’s part of human nature. 
Fourth, and ﬁnally: The premise that we will be a better nation, a more uniﬁed nation, 
if we all look the same, is suspect. 
Now what does this hypothetical world, this hypothetical Congresswoman and her 
proposal have to do with language, and more to the point, with language and dis-
crimination? People will immediately claim that language cannot stand in for height

INTRODUCTION 
and weight in this story. The argument will go that language is an ethereal, mutable 
thing, something we learn, something within our control. Height and weight are 
biological facts of the physical world, determined by genetics and nutrition in the 
first line, and by will and habit only secondarily. Language – which languages we 
speak, and how we speak them – is a matter of choice, people will argue, whereas height 
is not. 
In the course of this book I will argue that language has more in common with height 
and weight than is readily apparent, and that the same reservations which are so 
self-evident when we talk about manipulation of our physical bodies can and must be 
applied to discourse about language, and the manipulation and evaluation of language. 
Language, a possession all human collectives have in common, is more than a tool 
for communication of facts between two or more persons. It is the most salient way we 
have of establishing and advertising our social identities. It may not be as tangible as 
height and weight, but the way we use language is more complex and meaningful than 
any single fact about our bodies. 
The degree of control we have over language is limited. We can choose to be polite 
or obtuse, to use forms of address which will flatter or insult, to use gender-neutral 
language or language that is inflammatory; we can consciously use vocabulary which 
is easily understood, or we can purposefully mislead with language. But there are 
many dimensions of language which are not subject to conscious or direct control. 
And still, as speakers we are obsessed with the idea of authority over language: we talk 
a great deal about language as if it were an indispensable but often wayward and 
unpredictable servant, in need of our constant attention and vigilance if the job is to get 
done. 
Crucial questions have been raised here which will occupy the rest of this study: 
What is the relationship between language and social identity? How do we use 
language to construct “self” and “other”? 
What is or is not mutable about language, speciﬁcally about phonetics and phonology 
(accent)? 
Do individuals have language rights which render the question of mutability 
irrelevant? That is, is it desirable or even possible to balance the individual’s language 
rights with the needs of the community? Is this an appropriate matter for majority 
rule, or is it an area where the tyranny of the majority is a real threat, and individual 
liberties must be invoked? 
Who claims authority to make these decisions, how do they manage to do this, and 
why do people let them? 
All of these questions are important to this study, but the last question is perhaps the 
most complex and difficult one. There is a common conception that there is a good 
English, and following from that, bad English. Further, there is a good deal of consensus 
on who speaks good English, and who has authority to decide what is good. While anyone 
would anticipate heated debate on the height/weight legislation (who has the authority 
to decide what an ideal person looks like, and on what aesthetic, biological or other 
grounds?), it is interesting to note that there is little debate at all about who sets the 
standards for spoken and written language, standards which have been the focus of 
legislation, standards which affect our everyday lives.

INTRODUCTION 
Before we can set out on an exploration of these issues, however, there must be some 
common ground, built of established facts about language structure and function. Be 
prepared to give up some dearly held beliefs – things your teachers and parents and 
mentors told you – as you forge ahead.

The linguistic facts of life 
1  
To disarm the strong and arm the weak would be to change the social order which it 
is my job to preserve. Justice is the means by which established injustices are 
sanctioned. 
Anatole France, Crainquebille ([1901] 1949: iv) 
All over the world, right at this moment, very young children are acquiring a ﬁrst language, 
and every one of them is going through the same stages at just about the same ages. A child 
in Papua New Guinea and a child in Carson City, Nevada, born on the same day, will mirror 
one another as they go through those stages, even if one of them is acquiring Sign Language 
and the other a spoken language.1 In Nairobi or El Paso, Okinawa or Bruges, the pattern 
is the same. It was the same for you, and for me and for those who come after us. 
One of the most important linguistic insights of the last century was quite simple: this 
species-wide, universal phenomenon could not be coincidental. Noam Chomsky proposed 
what now seems obvious: 
The fact that all normal children acquire essentially comparable grammars of great 
complexity with remarkable rapidity suggests that human beings are somehow 
specially designed to do this, with data-handling or “hypothesis-formulating” ability 
of unknown character and complexity. 
(Chomsky 1959: 62) 
In other words, our brains are hard-wired for language; it’s in our DNA. A child has the 
innate capacity to acquire language, something like a blueprint in the mind that makes it 
possible to recognize and absorb the structural patterns of language. He or she uses the 
data available in the environment to build a mother tongue by ﬁlling in and adapting those 
blueprints. Better understanding of this process came with the identiﬁcation of one (and 
as yet, the only identiﬁed) of the genes that contribute to the language faculty. The FOXP2 
gene was isolated by means of neuropsychological, neuroimaging and genetic investi-
gations of three generations of one family with severe speech and language disorders 
(Gopnik 1990; Vargha-Khadem and Liégeois 2007).2 
So while the primary focus in this study is American English, the language phenomena 
discussed here are relevant to every language community and every human being.3 To 
understand these bigger issues, you will need to be familiar with some of those basic 
universal facts about the structure and function of human language. These are things you 
do not know, unless you’ve studied linguistics, in the same way you do not know how your 
brain causes your hand to turn the page of this book unless you’ve studied anatomy, 
physiology and neurology. 
Some of the things you read here may seem at ﬁrst counter-intuitive or just plain wrong, 
and in fact there are some obstacles to laying out these ideas.

THE LINGUISTIC FACTS OF LIFE 
Linguists4 do not form a homogenous club. Like any other group of scholars divided 
by a common subject matter, there are great rivalries, ancient quarrels, picky arguments, 
and plain differences of opinion. It could hardly be otherwise in a discipline diverse 
enough to include topics such as neurological structures and linguistic capacity, 
grammaticalized strategies for encoding social information in systems of address, and 
creolization. Thus it should be no surprise that those who study the rules which generate 
the ordering of words into sentences (syntacticians and cognitive grammarians, for 
example) are often openly disdainful of each other’s approach, on theoretical grounds, 
and of the study of the social life of language, more generally. Linguists concerned with 
the relationship between structured variation in language and social identity (socio-
linguists, variationists, some anthropological linguists) chide both syntacticians and 
cognitive grammarians for what they see as unreasonable abstractions and lack of 
reproducible results; phoneticians go about their business of understanding and theo-
rizing the way humans produce and perceive sound – the architects and engineers of 
linguistics – and wonder what all the noise is about; historical linguists concern themselves 
with the written data of lost language communities and write complex formulas for the 
reconstruction of sounds that might have been heard around the early Roman explora-
tions of central Europe, or in more extreme cases, when people ﬁrst wandered from Asia 
to the North American land mass. 
However, there is a great deal that linguists do agree about. For example, the statement 
All living languages change is one that no academic linguist would deny, unless they were 
to ask for a deﬁnition of “living” and to debate the parameters and implications of that 
term, just for the fun of it. And, of course, not all linguists find the fact that all living 
languages change to be equally interesting or worthy of study. The very subject of this 
book – how people think about language, how and why they try to control it, to what ends, 
and with what social repercussions – has received comparatively little attention. 
Traditionally, linguists draw a strict line in the sand. They stand on one side with what 
they hope is their own objective, analytic approach to the study of language; on the other 
side they see prescriptivists who have a shallow understanding of human language, and 
whose primary purpose is to exert an authority that they have not earned (but see Chapter 
5 for Lakoff’s discussion of rationality as a philosophy). 
More recently, however, linguists have been putting aside this strict division in 
recognition of the fact that how people think about language – no matter how ill-founded 
such beliefs might be – is in fact relevant to the study of language as a social construct. 
Dennis Preston has produced a large body of work on the way attitudes toward language 
are relevant to the study of variation and change. He sees the juxtaposition as a matter of 
focus: is the study oriented toward the participants (speakers), or is the approach analyst-
centric? 
What linguists believe about standards matters very little; what non-linguists believe 
constitutes precisely that cognitive reality which needs to be described in a responsible 
sociolinguistics – one which takes speech-community attitudes and perception (as well as 
performance) into account (Preston 1993b: 26). 
We begin with those linguistic facts of life that will be crucial to the issues raised in the 
course of this book: 
All spoken language changes over time. 
All spoken languages are equal in terms of linguistic potential. 
Grammaticality and communicative effectiveness are distinct and independent issues.

THE LINGUISTIC FACTS OF LIFE 
Written language and spoken language are historically, structurally and functionally 
fundamentally different creatures. 
Variation is intrinsic to all spoken language at every level, and much of that variation 
serves an emblematic purpose. 
This small collection of facts is where most linguists would come together. The irony is 
that where linguists settle down to an uneasy truce, non-linguists take up the battle cry. 
The least disputed issues around language structure and function, the ones linguists argue 
about least, are those which are most often challenged by non-linguists, and with the 
greatest vehemence and emotion. 
Here I am concerned primarily with common beliefs and attitudes toward variation in 
American English (AE), and from there, I hope to demonstrate how such attitudes inﬂu-
ence personal and institutionalized policy and practice, with very real severe consequences. 
This distinction between individual and institutionalized effects is quite purposeful, and 
the reason for that is laid out in The Everyday Language of White Racism (Hill 2008), Jane 
Hill’s excellent and very detailed look at these topics from her viewpoint as an anthro-
pological linguist: 
Critical theorists do not deny that individual beliefs ﬁgure in racism. But we prefer 
to emphasize its collective, cultural dimensions, and to avoid singling out individuals 
and trying to decide whether they are racists or not. Furthermore, critical theorists 
insist that ordinary people who do not share White supremacist beliefs can still talk 
and behave in ways that advance the projects of White racism. 
(Hill 2008: 7) 
All spoken language changes 
All language changes over time, in all linguistic subsystems: sounds (phonetics, phonology); 
the structure of words (morphology, lexicon), the way sentences are put together (syntax), 
and meaning (semantics). Only moribund, dead languages (languages that have no native 
speakers) are static.5 This is as true in Asia as it is in on the North American continent, as 
it is for every language in the world. 
Linguists base this assertion on observation, experimentation, and deduction, so that 
the statement all living languages change is not a matter of faith or opinion or aesthetics, 
but observable fact. And yet, some people – some of you reading this right now – are 
doubtful. There are many people who are uncomfortable with the idea that they cannot 
control all aspects of language. 
For me as a sociolinguist, the interesting thing about this question is how it came to be 
asked in the ﬁrst place. Why do so many people feel threatened by the idea of language 
change? Why do they contest the idea with so much emotion? How did the idea of a 
perfect, unchanging language become so deeply instilled? Even the most idealistic and 
nostalgic of language observers cannot argue that Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Austen, 
Woolf, Wharton, Morrison and Erdrich (to take us from the fourteenth to the twenty-
ﬁrst century), some of the men and women who wrote what is commonly regarded as the 
great literature of the English-speaking world, all wrote the same English. 
To take it one step further: Toni Morrison6 does not write or talk like Shakespeare 
wrote and talked. Few people would claim that because that is true, Morrison’s command

THE LINGUISTIC FACTS OF LIFE 
of the language is faulty, that the English she speaks and writes is bad, less efﬁcient, less 
capable of carrying out the functions for which it is needed. And still people will take up 
the battle cry and declare war on language change. All those attempts – and there have 
been a lot of them – are doomed to failure, unless they are instituted by means of genocide.7 
Sometimes languages die a less sudden death, for example, when the community of 
speakers who use them disperse, succumb to plague, or otherwise are forcibly assimilated 
into dominant cultures (as in the case of most of the languages indigenous to the American 
continent); languages are born through the processes of pidginization and subsequent 
creolization. 
Language standardization could be characterized as an attempt to stop language change, 
or at least, to fossilize language by means of controlling variation. We’ll continue to explore 
that idea as a part of an in-depth consideration of the ideological structures which make 
standardization seem like such a good idea. 
Finally, it is important to keep in mind that what we know about the history of English 
is subject to ideological retellings. It has been widely observed that when histories are 
written, they focus on the dominant class.8 In the context of this study, that idea can be 
extended to language: the history of a language is written as the history of its language 
ideology. You may have heard this idea phrased differently, for example: histories are 
written by the winners, or even more concisely: consider the source. 
Generally studies of the development of the language over time are very narrowly 
focused on the smallest portion of speakers: those with power and resources to control 
the distribution of information. Crystal’s The Stories of English avoids this pitfall by looking 
at language in all its variation and stratiﬁcation (Crystal 2005). So every living language 
changes, and every variety of every living language changes. It is important to keep this 
in mind when considering arguments put forward by prescriptivists based on a faulty and 
partial knowledge of the history of English. 
All spoken languages are equal in linguistic terms 
All spoken languages are equally capable of conveying a full range of ideas and experiences, 
and of developing to meet new needs as they arise. This claim by linguists is usually 
countered by non-linguists with examples of languages which have been deemed less 
sophisticated. 
I was writing the other day about a dull evening at the theater, but “dull” wasn’t the 
word I wanted. Rodale’s Synonym Finder gave me, among many others, vacuous, 
dense, obtuse, thick, slow, indifferent, sluggish, lethargic, torpid, lifeless, listless, 
apathetic, drowsy, tedious, tiresome, boring, wearisome, uninteresting, bland, insipid, 
jejune, vapid, prosaic, lackluster, anodyne, innocuous, soporiﬁc, oscitant and blah. 
Does anyone want to try that in Choctaw? Or in Spanish, Swahili or Norse? 
(Kilpatrick 1999) 
Not so very long ago, in the larger scheme of things, English speakers did not have the 
vocabulary to talk about chemical weapons, aeronautical engineering, or genetic mapping. 
When our technology evolved to the point that we needed to discuss such things, so did 
our language. 
Language is incredibly ﬂexible and responsive; we make or borrow what we do not have. 
In this ﬂexibility and ability to change and adapt when necessity or will arises, all languages

– all varieties of any given language – are equal. If through an unexpected shift in the 
world’s economy the Arawakan speakers of Peru suddenly were sole possessors of some 
resource everyone else needed, then Arawakan would develop a variety of new vocabularies 
and grammatical strategies to deal with their new power on the world stage. 
It is simply not a useful exercise to compare Swahili to Tagalog to Finnish in order to 
determine which one is the better or more efﬁcient language: these are not cars. We cannot 
compare manufacturing costs, gas mileage, performance on rough terrain. Each language 
is suited to its community of speakers; each language changes in pace as that community 
and the demands of the speakers evolve. This applies not just to languages which are 
unrelated to one another, but also to varieties of a single language. Orange County and 
the Northwest side of Chicago, Boston Southie and the dialect of Smith’s Island in 
Chesapeake Bay, while very different varieties of English in many ways, are all equally 
efﬁcient as languages, although they do not enjoy the same degree of respect. 
If efﬁciency and clarity in communication are the ultimate goal in language use, then 
it might be argued that English is neither efﬁcient nor clear in terms of its pronouns, as 
a speaker cannot make clear, in purely grammatical terms, if she is addressing her 
comments to one speaker or more when she says: “I’d like to buy you dinner.” 
Of even more interest is the fact that the exchange in English happens without any 
indication of the social relationship between the speaker and the person or persons she is 
inviting. She might be a boss talking to two secretaries after a long day, or a mother talking 
to her son on the phone. She might be talking to a man she sees every day on the bus on 
her way home from work. 
Other languages are not so lax: the Romance languages (and many others) distinguish 
between singular and plural personal pronouns, as well as between formal and informal uses. 
Many languages also have a complex system of honoriﬁcs which requires that speakers 
situate themselves in social space in relationship to the person addressed. That is, the 
speaker will choose among as many as a dozen or more words or sufﬁxes or tones to add 
to the utterance, and with that choice he or she will indicate the degree of respect (based 
on age, profession, kinship or other factors), friendship, or lack of respect felt toward the 
other person. In Thailand, young teenage girls – socially very low in the scheme of things 
– routinely end their sentences with the tag I, little rat (Simpson 1997). 
Another example of a lack or hole in the structure of English is the fact that there is no 
impersonal third person singular pronoun. To the dismay of prescriptivists, we have only 
he or she, and thus must somehow cope in situations where we do not want to indicate 
gender. From the Chicago Manual of Style (2003): “Though some writers are comfortable 
with the occasional use of they as a singular pronoun, some are not, and it is better to do 
the necessary work to recast a sentence or, other options having been exhausted, use he 
or she.” 
In fact, the use of they (their, them) as singular pronouns is very old. Consider the 
following examples, dating back to early translations of the Bible: 
A person can’t help their birth. 
(Jane Austen, Emma) 
Whoever it is, I won’t see them tonight. 
(M.E. Braddon, Aurora Floyd) 
God send every one their heart’s desire! 
(William Shakespeare, Much Ado About Nothing)

Who is in love with her? Who makes you their conﬁdant? 
(King James Bible, Matthew 18:35) 
There are ways to avoid using they or their, but the usage of singular they is very ﬁrmly 
established. Using both female and male pronouns is considered awkward (Whoever it is, 
I won’t see him or her tonight). Nor does it work to use the neutral single pronoun: (*Whoever 
it is, I won’t see it tonight).9 Nevertheless, The Chicago Manual of Style and other authorities 
continue to take the stance that singular they is a recent and unhappy development. 
It is a credit to the power of standard language ideology (SLI) that many people – and 
you may be one of them – will look at these examples and say, well, yes, now that you 
mention it, English is rather inefﬁcient in these cases. But let’s consider some facts. 
First, a language which does not have an overt strategy for dealing with a grammatical 
or semantic distinction will have other ways of doing just that. We cannot claim that 
English speakers are incapable of making themselves clear on just who it is they are inviting 
to dinner. Social and regional varieties of English have developed a multitude of strategies 
for dealing with the singular/plural distinction. For example, in my own variety of 
American English, acquired in Chicago, we say you/you guys, in Belfast and some parts of 
the U.S. you/youse; in much of the Southern US you/you’uns or ya’ll; in parts of Pennsylvania 
you/yousns. 
An additional strategy employed by all speakers of English involves a range of lexical 
choices that might not engender negative social reactions, but which show strategic 
maneuvering: “Would you folks/people/chaps/fellows/kids like to . . .?” 
These all come from regionally or socially restricted varieties of English. Idealized 
*Standard American English (a term we’ll look at shortly; see p. 62) is bound, at least theo-
retically, by adherence to an inﬂexible grammar and thus is unable to change to address 
gaps in the language system. So then, isn’t it reasonable to say that a standardized English 
is not as efﬁcient as the social and regional dialects? 
This is a tempting argument, but it cannot survive close examination. All spoken 
language will cope with ambiguity of all kinds. If socially motivated rules forbid reliance 
on certain grammatical strategies or lexical terms, then discourse, intonation and body 
language strategies can be called into play: 
“Would you [single eye contact] like to have a meal with me?” 
“Would you [multiple eye contact] like to have a meal with me?” 
It is an odd thing that we should think about language as if it were a machine invented to 
serve the purpose of communication, and thus open to criticism on the same grounds in 
which we talk about our lawnmowers and food processors. In the next sections we will see 
that these misconceptions have less to do with inherent qualities of language than they do 
with a preoccupation with form (as opposed to function), which in turn originates in part 
with struggles over authority in the determination of language and social identity. 
Grammaticality does not equal communicative effectiveness 
Linguists and non-linguists both see grammar as a set of rules which must be obeyed, but 
they differ on the nature and origination of those rules. When linguists talk about 
grammar, they are thinking about the rule-driven structure of language. On the basis of

----- Page 36 (native) -----
THE LINGUISTIC FACTS OF LIFE 
11 
those rules, individuals generate sentences. Children have acquired a working knowledge 
of this grammar of their native language by the age of 4. 
A linguist would not call any of the following example sentences ungrammatical: 
If you’re going out, I’m coming with. 
I might could stop at the store on the way home. 
You know Vicky be working after school. 
For reals, he won the lottery! 
If I had had three of them, you could’ve tooken one. 
Here are ﬁve things Joe should have went to jail for. 
I would of helped if I had known. 
We misunderestimated them. 
That’s just what Maria said to Marcos and I. 
Ain’t nobody can beat me no how. 
Which of the three boys was less troublesome? 
The house needs painted. 
He’s the kind of guy that’s always borrowing money. 
The data does not support your conclusion. 
Put it in your pocket. 
The ‘mistakes’ in these sentences would be more or less obvious to people who concern 
themselves with such things, with the possible exception of the last two examples. In those 
cases, many academics probably would argue that the noun data must be used as a plural, 
with a plural verb (The data do not support your conclusion); particularly hardline prescriptivists 
would be sure to point out that things are put into a pocket. 
For non-linguists, grammaticality is used in a much broader and ﬂuid sense. It encom-
passes the spoken and written languages, and extends to matters of style and even punc-
tuation. However, most important differences between the two approaches to grammar 
have to do with the concept of socially motivated grammaticality. 
Pinker uses the example of a taxicab to illustrate the distinction. As it is a useful 
illustration I have adapted it here: “The Taxicab Maxim: A taxicab must obey the laws of 
physics, but it can ﬂout the laws of the state of Michigan (or Massachusetts, or London, 
etc.)” (Pinker 1994b). To take a closer look at this idea, please consider the sentences in 
Table 1.1, and the way they are evaluated. 
The last four examples are where the linguist and the non-linguist usually part ways. As 
any of these sentences could be – and are – heard in casual conversation every day on 
Table 1.1 Grammaticality judgment comparison

American streets, they are grammatical. A prescriptivist will take issue with the way the 
verbs have been used but even a prescriptivist could not claim that the meaning was unclear 
– we know exactly what it means if we hear somebody say my sister is taller than me. The 
hardline prescriptivist would say that the correct usage is my sister is taller than I. Formulated 
this way, the speaker would not be seen as well-spoken, but as odd or pretentious or perhaps, 
a non-native speaker. 
Chomsky’s famous demonstration of the difference between grammatical and well-
formed was ﬁrst published in 1957, and hasn’t yet been replaced by a better one. Sentences 
(1) and (2) are equally nonsensical, but any speaker of English will recognize that only the 
former is grammatical. 
1 
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. 
2 
Furiously sleep ideas green colorless. 
(Chomsky 1957) 
“*Furiously sleep ideas green colorless” is not grammatical for any speaker of English, 
descriptivist or prescriptivist. No child growing up in an English-speaking community 
would produce this sentence, just as you never have to remind a child about other points 
of language-internal, rule-governed grammaticality. When is the last time you heard 
somebody say to a child something like: “Susie! Stop putting your articles after your 
nouns!” 
The concept of grammaticality might seem to be vague, because the methodology is 
so very simple: a person is asked if a given sentence suits their personal sense of well-
formedness. A set of four sentences will help demonstrate how this works: 
1 
Sam put a red scarf on the dog.  
2 
George took the dog.  
3 
Linda asked what Sam put the red scarf on.  
4 
*George took the dog that Linda asked what Sam put a red scarf on.  
The first three sentences are grammatical (they sound well-formed, as something you 
might say or hear said) for native speakers of English. The third one will make most people 
stop and think, but it can be unraveled. The last one cannot. 
This process is used extensively by theoretical syntacticians, a ﬁeld in which linguists 
are not interested in variation or change in language. When theoretical syntacticians come 
across native speakers who disagree on the grammaticality of a given utterance (which will 
happen quite often), they may note that as “noise,” but otherwise abstract away from it. 
Socially constructed grammar is what your parents or teachers were targeting when 
they corrected your language use. If Susie loudly announces “I gotta pee” during religious 
services, or if she says “I ain’t got none,” when she is asked about pets, some adult nearby 
may correct her, as you were possibly corrected (so long as the ﬁrst language you acquired 
was English). Everyone seems to have memories of this kind, perhaps because such 
corrections can be quite harsh. 
Linguists often keep notes on overheard conversations that illustrate such points. For 
example, in 1989, in Borders Books in Ann Arbor, an expensively dressed woman went 
rushing by, her son – maybe 10 years old – running to keep up with her. Over her shoulder 
she said to him: “I hate it when you use such ignorant, slovenly language. We don’t talk 
like that.”

I didn’t hear what the boy had said to get this kind of rebuke, but the vitriol in the 
mother’s voice, the dismissive tone in the way she corrected her son stuck with me. Suppose 
the boy had said, “Dad says the house needs painted.”10 This is a construction common in 
Michigan and some other areas in the Midwest, but it usually strikes non-Michiganders as 
odd. It still strikes me as odd, though I lived there for more than ten years. This usage is 
strongly marked for both region and socioeconomic status (Murray and Simon 1999). 
If a boy growing up in Michigan used this construction, why would a parent correct 
him so abruptly? It’s not that she didn’t understand the message he was trying to get across; 
just the opposite. She was reacting to the social markers her son was using. The rules 
violated were not linguistic in nature; the objections rose out of socially constructed 
concepts of proper English and good language. I do not identify with Michiganders, the 
mother was saying, and neither do you. Stop talking like them. 
Social conventions are a tremendously powerful source in our lives. Consider for a 
moment: A man wakes up one morning, ready to go to work. He’ll be giving a speech he’s 
been preparing for weeks, to an audience of a thousand employees. Everything hangs on 
this speech. His life goals, his career. Everything. If he handles it right, he’ll be promoted 
to CEO. If he doesn’t, his career at this company – and perhaps everywhere – is over. This 
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and he’s prepared for it. 
Except when he goes to his closet to get the polished shoes, freshly ironed shirt and 
crisp new suit, they aren’t there. In fact, none of his clothes are there. He searches through 
the whole house, and ﬁnds not so much as one of his socks, anywhere. The only piece of 
clothing is a dress hanging in the guest room closet along with a pair of matching pumps, 
which look like they will actually ﬁt him. The dress and pumps – and the boxers he wore 
to bed – are all he has. 
His cell phone is dead, something he realizes just as the electricity goes out. No way to 
call for help. No neighbors within shouting distance. His car is missing – one more disaster 
– so he’ll have to take the bus, too. 
Does he wear the dress? 
Our social conventions develop over time, along with a complex set of rationalizations. 
If a woman stands up in the middle of a restaurant eating linguini with clam sauce with 
her hands, the owner would probably feel justiﬁed in asking the customer to change her 
behavior or leave. Most people would consider this a reasonable request. 
But what if when the owner went up to the woman to ask her to leave, she turned into 
a mouse and disappeared between the ﬂoorboards? 
This possibility had not occurred to you, for the simple reason that it violates all the 
things we understand about the physical universe. The woman eating with her hands is 
ignoring the laws of socially acceptable behavior in public; when she turns into a mouse, 
she is flouting the rules of physics. Thus it is necessary to make a distinction between 
linguistic grammaticality and socially constructed grammaticality.11 
I have put forward as facts that any language embedded in a viable speech community 
is capable of adapting to any linguistic need, and that every native speaker produces 
utterances which are by deﬁnition grammatical. What I have not claimed and cannot claim, 
is that message content can be judged in the same way. Take, for example, the sentence: 
If we don’t succeed, we run the risk of failure. 
This sentence is grammatical in every sense of the word, but it makes no sense. It sounds 
well-formed but there isn’t any content.

----- Page 39 (native) -----
14 
THE LINGUISTIC FACTS OF LIFE 
The fact is that each utterance, while grammatical, may or may not fulﬁll the purpose 
for which it was conceived and formulated, for a wide variety of reasons. Consider the 
following hypothetical responses (B1–B5) to a simple question, (A): 
A: Can I have your phone number?  
B1: I’ll have a beer.  
B2: Uh, well, I’m not sure – what is my phone number, it’s – ah –, I don’t –.  
B3: What’s a phone, and why does it have a number?  
B4: When hell freezes over.  
B5: It’s 555-3333.  
To determine linguistic grammaticality, a very simple question sufﬁces: Can this utterance 
be generated by the grammar of the language? Each of the responses above is a gram-
matical construction for my own variety of English, and for many others. But an evaluation 
of content and socially construed well-formedness or efﬁciency moves to issues of intent, 
composition, and delivery. In each case, we could ask a number of questions to evaluate 
the responses given. 
Is the message clear? 
Is it easily broken down into its constituents? 
Does one point follow logically from the previous point? 
Is it couched in concise language and free of excess and overly complex construction? 
Is it persuasive? 
Is the delivery pleasing? 
The ﬁve possible responses provided for the question “Can I have your phone number?” 
could be judged on the basis of clarity, logic, conciseness, persuasiveness, and delivery, 
but not until we have more information, because the communicative intent of both the 
question posed and the answer received are multidimensional. It is possible to imagine 
many underlying purposes to the question “Can I have your phone number?” depending 
on the context in which it is asked, and the relationship of speaker to listener. In one 
possible situation (in which one person is trying to establish a romantic or sexual rela-
tionship), the answer “Uh, well, I’m not sure – what is my phone number, it’s – ah –, I 
don’t –” may not be concise (in the sense of “succinct”), but the underlying message is, 
after all, a complex one: I have evaluated you as a potential romantic and/or sexual partner and 
I ﬁnd that you are not acceptable, but I have no wish to insult you directly or embarrass you, and 
in fact I am afraid of the social consequences of doing so. 
Within its social context, the reply is very clear, and it is also concise in that it gets its 
message across with fewer lexical items than the alternate proposed. Alternatively, When 
hell freezes over is a longer answer than no, but it is also much more descriptive and 
informative. A simple negation leaves room for interpretation of motive; When hell freezes 
over leaves very little doubt about the speaker’s feelings. 
In Europe in the medieval and early modern periods, liberal arts consisted in part of 
the study of grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the trivium), where rhetoric is taken to mean 
language used effectively and persuasively. This concern with effective language persists, 
although the term remains, as always, a subjective one.12 If effectiveness in language is the 
sum of more speciﬁc qualiﬁers (clarity, logic, conciseness, persuasiveness, and delivery), 
then calculation of effectiveness is complicated by the fact that these are subjective rather

----- Page 40 (native) -----
THE LINGUISTIC FACTS OF LIFE 
15 
than objective measures. Whether or not these are reasonable demands of language as a 
vehicle of communication is also debatable. Is language more effective when sentences are 
short, or long? When it is spoken fast, or slow? When the vocabulary used is primarily 
Germanic (help!), or Romance (assistance!)? 
I will argue at various points in this book that the evaluation of language effectiveness 
can sometimes serve as a way of judging not the message, but the social identity of the 
messenger. 
Political debate provides daily examples of highly educated and powerful people who 
speak what is generally considered *Standard American English (*SAE). Some of them do 
use language clearly and concisely, while others seem incapable of expressing simple ideas 
clearly. When the media draw attention to a politician’s language use, not the content, 
but the variety of English itself – they are not accusing that politician of lying under oath 
or running Ponzi schemes or of dereliction of duty. Such commentary is not about policy 
or law; it is delivered in the manner of the finger-wagging way of children on the 
playground, the ones who police the social structure and keep people in their place. The 
fact is, the variety of English a person speaks, highly regarded or stigmatized, standard-
like or vernacular, cannot predict the quality and effectiveness of any given utterance or 
that person’s worth as a communicator. 
What can be predicted is the fact that listeners will make assumptions about the speaker 
on the basis of language markers that signal alliance to certain social groups, primarily 
those having to do with race, ethnicity and economic factors. 
Written language and spoken language are historically, 
structurally, and functionally fundamentally different 
creatures 
In the history of mankind, widespread literacy is a relatively new development, one that 
trailed along behind technological advances in printing and the manufacture of paper. 
Early printers had some things to work out, including the question of norms and 
standardization. If Caxton had to print the Bible in ten different dialects of English, there 
would be little or no profit in the venture, which was, of course, not acceptable. The 
solution was to print the Bible in one variety of English, and then to convince everybody 
that that was the best kind of English. Thus began the movement toward language norms 
and standardization of the printed (and then, written) language. 
It seems a matter of logic and convenience from a business perspective, but this 
narrowing-down and standardizing process was a long and arduous one. Who was going 
to make decisions about spellings and grammatical structures? Who was going to teach 
them, who would impose them, and how? 
As it became possible to make key religious, literary and legal documents available on 
a wider basis, the standardized written language became a commodity of increasing value. 
In the ﬁrst line, the control of this commodity was in the hands of those who were on the 
front line of teaching reading and writing. Trained clerks and lowly teachers claimed 
authority, and began to make a living out of telling people what their language should 
look and sound like. The job was not only to teach writing, but more important, to instill 
a respect for institutionalized authority in matters of language. This is still the case today. 
The most salient feature which distinguishes an abstracted, idealized standard written 
or printed English from the reality of spoken language is conformity or the suppression

----- Page 41 (native) -----
16 
THE LINGUISTIC FACTS OF LIFE 
of variation. That suppression is not easily achieved. It is a battle continually fought, and 
never completely won. 
For linguists, the spoken language is of primary (and often, exclusive) interest. In this 
we linguists are pretty much alone; for most people involved in education – and many 
others, as well – the written language continues as a commodity of huge dimensions and 
complexity: 
Although the bias that speech is primary over writing has been extremely important 
in guiding research efforts within linguistics, it has not been widely accepted outside 
of linguistics. In fact, the historical view that written, literary language is true language 
continues as the dominant lay perception to the present time. Our children need to 
study English at school, which includes written composition and the prescriptive rules 
of writing, not speech . . . We expect our grammars and dictionaries to present the 
correct forms of written language; [when they instead ] present both literate and 
colloquial vocabulary they are severely criticized for destroying the standards of 
English. 
(Biber 1988: 5–6) 
The primacy of the spoken language is easy enough to bolster with factual evidence, but 
it is perhaps the single most difﬁcult concept for non-linguists to fully grasp and accept. 
In our minds the spoken and written languages are so intertwined that we seem sometimes 
incapable of distinguishing between them. A LanguageLog post (“Pronouncing it by the 
book”)13 provides examples of the kind of extreme emotional investment some people put 
in the idea of the superiority of the written language: 
She was from Northern California, but had been born in the Midwest, and she 
acknowledged, “Everyone always assumes I’m British or something just because I’m 
more careful to pronounce words properly. It only sounds unusual because everyone 
simply ignores how words are spelled anymore.” Everyone else at the table simply 
nodded as though that made all the sense in the world. 
The internet abounds with examples of people who are proud to promote the superiority 
of the written language, and at the same time, to conﬂate written and spoken languages, 
adding punctuation to the mix: “Nothing destroys precision grammar and correct usage 
like raw, unmitigated anger [. . .] excessive use of capital letters, abundance of exclamation 
points, and lack of proper punctuation.”14 
In this weblog writer’s view, too many exclamation points renders a piece of writing 
ungrammatical. I dislike exclamation points myself, but never once have I failed to 
understand a document because of them. Punctuation is irrelevant to the kind of work 
sociolinguists do, and has nothing to do with grammaticality. And yet, arguments about 
punctuation and the written word rage on: the misuse of semicolons, the insidious serial 
comma, the virus-like greengrocers’ apostrophe sneaking into possessive nouns to herald 
the imminent fall of Western civilization.15 
Arguments about usage are routinely settled by pulling out reference books (The 
Chicago Manual of Style, for example) or dictionaries. The dictionary is regarded as the 
highest authority in matters of language. Few people ever stop to ask how it is that the 
dictionary has taken – or has been given – such absolute authority. For the most part, 
individuals feel entitled to make pronouncements about language and to base those

assertions on dictionaries or vague, never deﬁned authorities, as in the case of a character 
on Showtime’s Californication. Here the irreverent, quick-witted, curmudgeonly Hank 
Moody (played by David Duchovny) is rebelling against the intrusion of computers into 
life and language: 
People. . . they don’t write anymore – they blog. Instead of talking, they text, no 
punctuation, no grammar: LOL this and LMFAO that. You know, it just seems to 
me it’s just a bunch of stupid people pseudo-communicating with a bunch of other 
stupid people in a proto-language that resembles more what cavemen used to speak 
than the King’s English. 
Hank is a writer and as such, considers himself an authority on all matters having to do 
with language, written or spoken. He conﬂates the two without a pause or hesitation, and 
he is resentful because he believes others are ruining the language he (and the King) 
command. The offenders use language, as he sees it, without grammar. Note also that he 
refers to the King’s English in spite of the fact that there is currently no king, but a queen 
in England. This is not insigniﬁcant, given Moody’s character. 
This kind of assertion about language, no matter how lacking in consistency or logic 
or factual underpinning, is received enthusiastically and repeated widely. In this case, 
Hank’s testy ode to the decline of English was cited more than 3,000 times on the internet 
within a few months of the episode’s ﬁrst broadcast. 
Prince Charles often demonstrates the same tendency in public speeches, as we see in 
the following example given in 1989 when he was judging a reading competition: 
If English is spoken in Heaven (as the spread of English as a world language makes 
more likely each year) God undoubtedly employs Cranmer as his speech-writer. The 
angels of the lesser ministries probably use the language of the New English Bible 
and the Alternative Service Book for internal memos. 
I suppose we must be fair and point out that the Prince of Wales does not automatically 
assume that English is spoken in heaven. Nevertheless, his further assumptions are quite 
interesting. Those language authorities he cites as exemplary all draw their power from 
religious institutions. Thomas Cranmer was the Archbishop of Canterbury (the head of 
the Anglican Church) under Henry VIII; the Prince of Wales offers Cranmer as an 
authority because he simpliﬁed and translated the Latin prayer books into one English 
volume, the Book of Common Prayer. Then Henry VIII got a real lock on things by 
coming up with England’s Act of Uniformity, which made the Book of Common Prayer 
the only acceptable book of its kind. 
It is also interesting that the written documents which are cited here as appropriate 
models for the spoken language are British ones (in other places, Prince Charles has been 
very critical of the damage that has been done to English by its speakers on the North 
American continent). Most important to the discussion immediately at hand is the way 
this picture of language perfection takes as a departure point the idea that the various 
mediums of language are one and the same. Here we see mention of spoken language, 
speeches (which can be given as planned but extemporaneous speech, or the reading out 
loud of written language), and written language. 
This proclamation by the future king of England builds on a tradition which goes back 
to Socrates, who suggested that the gods took a direct interest in language:

----- Page 43 (native) -----

THE LINGUISTIC FACTS OF LIFE 
Hermogenes: And where does Homer say anything about names, and what does he 
say? 
Socrates: He often speaks of them – notably and nobly in the places where he distin-
guishes the different names which gods and men give the same things. Does he 
not in these passages make a remarkable statement about the correctness of 
names? For the gods must clearly be supposed to call things by their right and 
natural names, do you not think so? 
(Hamilton and Cairns 1961: 429–430) 
More recently, in an event which is almost certainly apocryphal,16 Miriam “Ma” Ferguson, 
the ﬁrst female governor of the State of Texas, expressed the decisive argument against 
bilingual education (and unwittingly, for more and better history and geography instruc-
tion) by drawing on the (for her) ultimate authority: “If English was good enough for Jesus 
Christ,” she declared, “then it’s good enough for the schoolchildren of Texas” (Handbook 
of Texas 2009). 
It has been pointed out that “writing and speaking are not just alternative ways of doing 
the same things; rather, they are ways of doing different things” (Halliday 1989: xv). That 
is, we write things that tax our ability to remember (genealogies, instruction manuals, legal 
documents), or to project our thoughts through space and time. We speak everything else. 
But aren’t they the same thing, just as water is water whether it ﬂows, or freezes so that 
we can walk on it? Isn’t it just a matter of presentation? Can’t speech and writing be treated 
as different manifestations of the same mental phenomenon? Wouldn’t spoken language 
be more efﬁcient if we treated it like written language? 
Writing systems are a strategy developed in response to demands arising from social, 
technological and economic change. The purpose of writing systems is to convey decon-
textualized information. We write love letters, laundry lists, historical monographs, novels, 
mythologies, wound care manuals, menus, out to lunch signs, biochemistry textbooks. We 
write these things down because our memories are not capable of storing such masses of 
information for ourselves or those who come after us, or because we consider the message 
one worthy of preserving past a particular point in time. 
The demands made on written language are considerable: we want it to span time and 
space, and we want it to do that in a social vacuum, without the aid of paralinguistic features 
and often without shared context of any kind. Thus, the argument goes, written language 
needs to be free of variation: it must be consistent in every way, from spelling to sentence 
structure.17 
We might think of the difference between spoken and written language (see Table 1.2) 
as the difference between walking and machines built for the purpose of transporting 
human beings. Unless a child suffers a terrible turn of fate, she will learn to walk without 
focused instruction. No one must show her how to put one foot ahead of the other. She 
will experiment with balance and gait, and learn to move herself physically to pursue food 
and shelter, to come in contact with another human being, to explore her world. Over 
time, the human race developed a series of technologies to improve the ability to move 
themselves: they tamed horses, camels, oxen; they built carts, carriages, boats, trains, 
bicycles, cars, airplanes, skateboards. All of these things are faster than walking, and, if 
speed is the primary criterion by which we judge efﬁciency of movement, they are superior 
to the skill all humans have in common. 
But it would not occur to us to set up standards for walking on the basis of the speed of 
any of these vehicles: it is a physical impossibility to walk 60 miles an hour. We cannot

heaven, people will speak like they write, as if this were the ultimate good, the ideal? 
In their seminal work on authority in language, James and Lesley Milroy point to the 
underlying issue which may explain – in part – why we are so willing to see the spoken 
language subordinated to the written. 
As writing skills are difﬁcult, our educational systems have concentrated on inculcating 
a relatively high degree of literacy, with little attention paid to the nature of spoken 
language as an everyday social activity. Training in the use of “English” . . . is usually 
assumed to be training in the use of written English . . . Spoken language is taken for 
granted. As a result of this constant emphasis on written language, there is an under-
standable tendency for people to believe that writing is somehow more complicated 
and difﬁcult (and more important) than speech. 
(Milroy and Milroy 1999: 55) 
This preoccupation with the written language to the exclusion of the spoken is quite easy 
to document. The National Association of Teachers of English, for example, publishes 
guidelines for the curriculum in English on a regular basis; of the twelve points addressed, 
only four include mention of spoken language skills, and then in a very vague and indirect 
way (a topic which will be taken up in more detail in Chapter 7).

THE LINGUISTIC FACTS OF LIFE 
From the spoken to the written language is a large step; it is another signiﬁcant step 
from the written language to the possession of literacy.18 However, the possession of a 
skill and the facility to use that skill to construct a product are cultural resources not equally 
available to all persons, and are heavily laden with social currencies. In the U.S., most 
people do not consider oral cultures as equal to literate ones. Some scholars have argued, 
with differing degrees of subtlety, that certain kinds or modes of thought cannot develop 
in oral cultures, and that for this reason literate cultures are superior. 
This type of argument has come under attack on both methodological and theoretical 
grounds. One of the oldest but still most comprehensive examples of such tortured 
reasoning is Bernstein’s (1966) theory of restricted and elaborated codes.19 Bernstein 
attempted (and failed) to establish that children who spoke “elaborated” languages at home 
(he called those languages syntactically complex) were more capable of logical thought 
and other cognitive advantages, and that children who heard only restricted codes in the 
home were at a disadvantage.20 
It is demonstrably true that in a literate culture, illiteracy is a social brand like few others. 
Cameron calls what goes on around the written language a circle of intimidation: 
[M]astering a complex and difﬁcult craft gives you an inbuilt incentive to defend its 
practices. If I have invested time and effort learning how to write according to a 
particular set of prescriptions, it will take some convincing that those prescriptions 
are not necessary and desirable; to admit that the rules are both arbitrary and pointless 
is to devalue my own accomplishment in mastering them. 
(Cameron 1995: 14) 
Gee goes a step farther when he outlines the complex associations and expectations of 
literacy: 
[L]iteracy leads to logical, analytic, critical and rational thinking, general and abstract 
uses of language, a skeptical and questioning attitude, a distinction between myth and 
history, the recognition of the importance of time and space, complex and modern 
governments . . . political democracy and greater social equity, economic develop-
ment, wealth and productivity, political stability, urbanization, and contraception (a 
lower birth rate) . . . The literacy myth is, in fact, one of the master Myths of our 
society; it is foundational to how we make sense of reality, though it is not necessarily 
an accurate reﬂection of that reality, nor does it necessarily lead to a just, equitable, 
and humane world. 
(Gee 2007a [1996]: 36) 
The literacy myth plays a role in the subordination of the spoken language to norms 
developed for the written language – norms that are in themselves arbitrary. This process 
is part of what Foucault has called the disciplining of discourse, or the way we decide who 
has the right to talk, and to be listened to (Foucault 1984), the major topic of interest in 
the later chapters of this book. 
Variation is intrinsic to all spoken language at every level 
Spoken language varies for every speaker in terms of speech sounds, sound patterns, word 
and sentence structure, intonation, and meaning, from utterance to utterance. This is true

----- Page 46 (native) -----
THE LINGUISTIC FACTS OF LIFE 
21 
even for those who believe themselves to speak an educated, elevated, supra-regional 
English. 
Variation is not a frivolous or sloppy or useless feature of language.21 Quite the contrary, 
the variants available to the speaker to choose from are not neutral, and while the choice 
between them may not be conscious, it is often purposeful. 
There are three main sources of variation in spoken language: 
1 
Language internal pressures, arising in part from the mechanics of production and 
perception. 
2 
External inﬂuences on language, such as geographic mobility and social behavior subject 
to normative and other formative social pressures. 
3 
Variation arising from language as a creative vehicle of free expression. 
These forces can and do function in tandem, and any good study of language change in 
progress will consider at least the ﬁrst two together. 
Variation over space is the dimension that most people seem to be aware of, but in a 
limited way. There are language communities of well-established, self-contained or 
isolated religious groups that mark their English for insider/outsider status (the Amish 
and Mennonites in Pennsylvania; Mormons in Utah and Arizona; Jews in Williamsburg 
and the greater New York City area, Hassidic Jews in Brookline, outside of Boston). There 
are historical language communities which remain bilingual despite outside pressures 
(German in parts of Michigan and Texas, French (independent of the Creole communities 
in Louisiana) (Figure 1.1), bilingual pockets in New England and Louisiana.

THE LINGUISTIC FACTS OF LIFE 
Variation that is less likely to reach the level of consciousness has to do with the human 
neurological and vocal apparatus, which is architecturally and structurally universal and 
which accounts for the similarities in the way language is produced and perceived. As a 
young child acquiring language, every human being has potentially available to them the 
full range of possible sounds. The sounds which will eventually survive and become part 
of the child’s language are arranged into language-speciﬁc systems, each sound standing 
in relation to the other sounds. In linguistic terms, the study of production and perception 
of speech sounds is the science of phonetics; concern with how sounds are organized into 
systems is called phonology. 
It is in the production and perception of speech sounds as systematic entities functioning 
in relationship to each other that there is perhaps the greatest potential for variation in 
language, and following from that, variation leading to change. There are so many changes 
in progress at any given time that it would not be possible to catalog them all, but in 
Chapter 2 we consider a few changes that may well be active in your own variety of 
English. 
To close this chapter I must point out what may seem obvious by now: linguists are 
outnumbered by prescriptivists, and outgunned, too. Prescriptivists are in a position to 
broadcast their opinions from positions of authority granted to them automatically, 
whereas linguists are conﬁned to university settings and conferences. This makes it possible 
for prescriptivists to simply ignore – or mock – what linguists have to say about language. 
They make full use of this advantage and that is unlikely to change, ever. 
By the end of this book you will be able to answer the crucial question for yourself: Are 
you comfortable with the institutional practices that are forced on individuals in the pursuit 
of proper English? If you are not – and not everyone will be – you must decide what you, 
as an individual, can do about it. 
Find out just what people will submit to, and you have found out the exact amount 
of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them; and these will continue until 
they are resisted with either words or blows, or both.

Kilpatrick disputes the claim that all languages and language varieties are potentially equal, 
and uses this comparison to make his point: “And to assert that all languages and all 
dialects ‘have the same expressive potential’ is to assert that the ukulele ranks with 
the cello” (Kilpatrick 1999). Does this strike you as a valid comparison? Why or why 
not? 
Milroy and Milroy (1999) state: “As writing skills are difﬁcult, our educational systems have 
concentrated on inculcating a relatively high degree of literacy, with little attention paid to 
the nature of spoken language as an everyday social activity.” Can you conceive of ways 
that our schools might pay more attention to developing spoken language skills? What 
would the goals be? 
Is FOXP2 evidence to support Chomsky’s innateness hypothesis? 
Notes 
1 Those stages are (1) babbling (repetitive consonant–verb patterns such as bababa or 
tatata); (2) one or two syllable words in isolation (duck, car, teddy); (3) two-word strings 
(more juice, get down, want that); (4) the telegraphic stage, where grammatical bits 
are mostly left out (Elmo kiss baby doll, Where mama going? I tie it myself). And 
onward to the acquisition of grammatical elements, complex structures and com-
municative competence. 
2 There has been a lot of exaggeration and misinformation about FOXP2 from the 
popular press. It is factually incorrect to call it “the grammar gene.” It does have 
something to do with articulation and ﬁne motor control needed for speech. It also 
seems to control the behavior of some hundred other genes. FOXP2 is best understood 
as a starting point “for future studies of the molecular basis of language and human 
evolution” (source: http://goo.gl/3Zwgd). 
3 While the more general language issues discussed here will be applicable to all English 
spoken on the continent, the exploration of speciﬁc authority and prescription issues 
focuses on the U.S. and with very few exceptions does not draw on material from other 
English-speaking countries. 
4 I refer here speciﬁcally to academic linguists. Outside of the discipline, the deﬁnition 
of linguist is much broader, including, among other things, a linguist as a polyglot. 
5 Any language which is no longer acquired as a ﬁrst language, and is no longer used in 
day-to-day communication by a community of persons is considered to be dead, 
whether or not it survives in a literary form. Many languages have died and left no 
record behind; however, there are cases where moribund languages have been revived. 
Hebrew is an example of a dead (or “sleeping”) language coming back to life. For two 
thousand years, Hebrew was preserved as a written and ritualistic language of the 
Jewish people only, and thus was dead by the technical deﬁnition. It is now spoken as 
a ﬁrst language by a good proportion of the population of Israel. 
6 Toni Morrison received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993. “[Morrison] made 
her debut as a novelist in 1970, soon gaining the attention of both critics and a wider 
audience for her epic power, unerring ear for dialogue, and her poetically-charged and 
richly-expressive depictions of Black America” (source: http://goo.g./ucXV5). 
7 The modern-day systematic and violent repression of the Kurdish language and culture 
in Turkey is one extreme example. (Skutnabb-Kangas et al. 1994.)

8 This statement is generally attributed to Kwame Nkrumah, former president of Ghana 
and father of the pan-national African movement. It is also widely paraphrased as 
“Histories are written by the victors.” 
9 The standard linguistic convention is to put an asterisk in front of a sentence or word 
that is ungrammatical; that is, cannot be generated by the native speaker’s grammar. 
10 Murray (1986) takes a closer look at the need + past participle construction. 
11 Milroy and Milroy draw a contrast between what they call Type 1 and Type 2 
complaints about language. If the opposition expressed is to language change itself, 
they term this Type 1; Type 2 complaints are concerned with efﬁciency in written 
language. I do not adopt this distinction because I ﬁnd it more important to take into 
consideration the conﬂation of written and spoken language and differing deﬁnitions 
of grammaticality. 
12 The 1992 edition of The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language points 
out that the word rhetoric has undergone a shift in usage: 
The word rhetoric was once primarily the name of an important branch of 
philosophy and an art deserving of serious study. In recent years the word has come 
to be used chieﬂy in a pejorative sense to refer to inﬂated language and pomposity. 
Deprecation of the term may result from a modern linguistic puritanism, which 
holds that language used in legitimate persuasion should be plain and free of artiﬁce 
– itself a tendentious rhetorical doctrine, though not often recognized as such. But 
many writers still prefer to bear in mind the traditional meanings of the word. Thus, 
according to the newer use of the term, the phrase empty rhetoric, as in “The 
politicians talk about solutions, but they usually offer only empty rhetoric,” might 
be construed as redundant. But in fact only 35 percent of the Usage Panel judged 
this example to be redundant. Presumably, it can be maintained that rhetoric can 
be other than empty. 
The mention of linguistic puritanism is surprising in this context; in fact, the tone might 
indicate that the editors are torn: they are surprised (and perhaps not quite satisﬁed) 
with the decision of their Usage Panel (in itself an interesting phenomenon), but they 
also point out the fact that rhetorical rules are not objective: they are doctrines.

15 This issue is so much in the minds of the public that in October 2009, the New York 
Times reissued an article entitled “Minder of Misplaced Apostrophes Scolds a Town” 
that originally appeared in 2001. 
16 Benjamin Zimmer’s weblog post dated April 29, 2006, at Language Log looks at this 
legend very closely. 
17 This is, of course, a fairly modern development. Early writing systems of Western 
European languages had no regulated orthography, no dictionaries or language 
pundits. Take, for example, the name Shakespeare, which shows up as Shakespeare, 
Shakespere, Shakespear, Shackspeare, Shake-speare, Shakspeare, and Shaxberd, to 
name just a few variants. It’s very hard to imagine anyone in the present day being so 
lax with spelling. John Steinbeck does not show up as John Stenpeck or Stienpack. 
Our orthography is so set in stone that it lags centuries behind change in the spoken 
language. 
18 In this discussion I have taken a short cut which some will ﬁnd questionable, in that I 
have not considered in any depth what is meant by literacy, a term which has been

----- Page 50 (native) -----

25 
widely used and which stands at the center of much scholarly and educational debate. 
Here I use literate both in its narrowest way, as a reference to the skill needed to read 
and write, and in some of its broader connotations, as a measurement of cultural 
knowledge. The history of thought about literacy is one which I do not have time to 
explore here, but it is obviously both interesting and important. In particular, it would 
be useful to understand the point in our history in which our perceptions of the 
relationship of the written and spoken language began to change, as it seems that the 
subordination of spoken to written language may be a fairly new cultural phenomenon. 
I am very thankful to Deborah Keller-Cohen for valuable discussions on this topic. 
19 While Bernstein never made explicit the connection between languages of oral cultures 
and “restricted” codes, or languages of literate ones and “elaborated” codes, my reading 
of his work is not an unusual one. 
20 In a persuasive essay on the advantages of multiculturalism, Charles Taylor (1994) 
discusses examples of the kind of reasoning which ranks literate cultures as inherently 
more valuable than oral ones. 
21 Earlier it was established that all living languages change; it can also be stated 
unequivocally that all change is preceded by variation. However, it cannot be claimed 
that all variation is followed by change.

Eppur’ si muove.1 
Galileo Galilei 
Changes in progress 
There is a common belief that regional differences in U.S. English are eroding, and that 
as time passes, we all will sound more alike. The broadcast and print media outlets are 
believed to be the power that fuels this march toward homogeneity, and remarks on this 
topic show up in letters to the editor, on discussion forums, in human interest news stories 
and in weblogs. For example, “Dialects are becoming rare. TV and increased geographic 
mobility have us speaking more and more alike no matter where we’re from. We’re losing 
a portion of our culture” (Braiterman 2008).2 
Where this idea originated is unclear. What we can be said with certainty is that regional 
varieties of English are not becoming more alike over time, despite mass communication. 
Hard evidence makes it clear that just the opposite is true. Regional varieties of American 
English are changing, and many of the changes in progress are causing differences to 
intensify rather than lessen. 
Salvucci (1999) synthesized all the major studies of language variation over space from 
1968 to the late 1990s, and came up with the map shown in Figure 2.1. The linguists who 
contributed to this identiﬁcation of dialect areas did so on the basis of bundles of linguistic 
features (or isoglosses) that constitute a kind of ﬂuid linguistic border. Some of the changes 
in progress discussed in this chapter may seem unlikely to you, but closer examination 
might change your mind. 
Each case is interesting for different reasons, and each case is vastly simpliﬁed here for 
our purposes. They are: 
the presence or absence of (r) after vowels; 
the Northern Cities Chain Shift; 
lexical variation and discourse markers; 
weak and strong verbs. 
r-less in Manhattan3 
The presence or absence of the /r/ sound after a vowel has been a sociolinguistic marker 
in the Eastern and Southern U.S. for a very long time, and it is also one of the most 
exhaustively studied. In the simplest terms, we are talking about /r/ when it occurs in the 
following positions or environments following a vowel:

From these studies it is quite clear that (r) is highly variable, and that its social 
signiﬁcance is strongly dependent on place (as demonstrated in the New England studies), 
age, and race. In Boston and New Hampshire, (r) is variable across a wide variety of factors 
to the degree that “No speaker was either categorically r-ful or categorically r-less, and 
thus no social group was categorically r-ful or r-less” (Irwin and Nagy 2010). 
At one point the absence of postvocalic (r) was common to most of New York City (and 
the East Coast more generally), but by the time Labov took up this study in the early 
1960s, that had begun to change. Labov observed that in Manhattan, some people were 
r-less and others r-ful. He hypothesized that the shift toward r-fulness was linked to social 
prestige and thus that the variation would pattern to socioeconomic factors. In order to 
test that hypothesis, he conducted a ﬁeld study which took place at three department stores 
in Manhattan: Saks, Macy’s, and Klein’s. The department stores represented three distinct 
socioeconomic classes: Saks’s shoppers were well-to-do; Macy’s were middle class; and 
Klein’s were working class. 
The ﬁeldworkers in each store asked counter clerks for directions to a department they 
already knew to be on the fourth ﬂoor (“Excuse me, where are women’s shoes?”). The 
clerk answered “Fourth floor,” and the fieldworker walked around a corner to make 
notations. This methodology resulted in hundreds of tokens of the words “fourth ﬂoor” 
in both casual and emphatic speech (Figure 2.2). 
Labov was able to pinpoint the effects of social class, prestige, style, gender, age, and 
other factors on the distribution of this data. The more socially elevated an individual was 
(or strove to be), the more postvocalic (r) sounds were retained in their speech. The simple 
conclusion would be that the lower the income level, the greater the r-lessness. But (r) is 
not simple. One way to get a sense of the range and distribution of postvocalic (r) is to 
watch reality television shows set on the East Coast between Philadelphia and Boston. 
The infamous Jersey Shore alone provides a lot of interesting examples. 
Prestige is a complex concept, because it is so very relative. What is prestigious to one 
person may mean nothing to the next. More important: what is prestigious is one 
community may be a mark of disloyalty and highly stigmatized in the next, and thus the 
simplest truth about language variation: a speaker will gravitate to the variants tied to the 
community which is most important to him or her, despite possible negative repercussions. 
Prestige is a notoriously relative concept, and is not always an issue of economics. 
Labov’s study established that for (r), those who aspire to belong to the social upper crust

are less likely to be r-less (Figure 2.3). Common sense alone should be enough to cast 
doubt on the idea that anybody in Manhattan who deletes postvocalic (r) is without ambi-
tions, and disdainful of the trappings of social prestige. All around us we see people of all 
social and economic backgrounds trying to improve their lot in life; some work three jobs, 
wrack up huge school loans, buy lottery tickets, or invest in the latest widget. The fact is, 
some people strive for economic success and socially upward movement, but resist 
assimilation to the language habits of others who have successfully achieved that goal. 
More recently new studies of r-lessness in Manhattan indicate that the distributions by 
socioeconomic class are stable (Fowler 1986). This is a good demonstration of the fact 
that variation is symbolic, that it is not necessarily unidirectional and further, that 
socioeconomic and sociolinguistic distributions do not necessary change at all. Speech 
that leans toward r-fulness is also very sensitive to formality and style issues, so that the 
more formal the situation, the more likely New Yorkers are to keep (r) after vowels (Fowler 
1986; Labov 1994: 83–87).

The stability of the distribution of r-lessness in Manhattan is especially surprising when 
looking at other data on change over time. Elliott (2000) looked at ﬁlms spanning most 
of the twentieth century, collecting data on an actor’s use of (r), along with information 
on the individual’s original variety of American English (Katherine Hepburn’s native 
variety is r-less; Ginger Rogers’ is r-ful) and other demographic information. One clear 
finding was that r-lessness was far more common earlier in the century, and that as 
the century progressed actors moved rapidly toward r-fulness. Figure 2.4 indicates 
that both groups – actors whose native variety of English is r-less (nonrhotic) and actors 
whose variety of English is r-ful (rhotic) – moved toward full r-fulness at about the same 
rate. 
In the 1970s, Feagin undertook a similar investigation in Anniston, Alabama, and found 
a similar change in progress. Northerners tend to think of all Southerners as r-less, but 
Feagin established that postvocalic (r) was creeping in quite steadily. Another ten years 
provided enough data and perspective for her to conclude that the South was moving from 
r-less to r-ful in only three generations (Feagin 1990). 
Elliott also found a great deal of stereotyping in the retention or deletion of (r), often 
within the same ﬁlm for the same actress. For example, Patty Duke’s character in Valley 
of the Dolls starts out as a prototypical good girl, at which point she is r-less no more than 
9 percent of the time; by the end of the movie she is a drug addict with no hope, and her 
r-less rate has risen to 29 percent (ibid.: 121–122). It is no surprise that an actor 
manipulates language in the process of trying to establish character, a topic that will come 
up again in the discussion of accent in children’s animated ﬁlm. 
So there is a wide range of factors that play a role in this change in progress. In addition 
to place, age is a strong predictor – the younger the speaker, the more postvocalic r-ful; 
so does education, so that people who have more formal education trend toward restoring 
(r). Race is more relevant still, as Labov (1972b) reports, “all other things being equal, 
African-American ethnicity lowers the frequency of (r) constriction by 32 percent.” 
African Americans tend to be r-less wherever they live, whether in Iowa (where postvo-
calic (r) is solid and categorical) or Alabama. Figure 2.5 indicates that New Hampshire is 
becoming more r-ful, while both Anglos and African Americans in Boston are resisting 
such a change. African Americans are more persistently r-less than Anglos. The two

groups’ resistance to r-fulness may look similar on the surface, but the underlying 
motivations are certainly different. 
This may be seen as following from many different factors, but the most important is 
likely the Great Migration. Between 1910 and 1940, roughly 1.5 million African Americans 
ﬂed to the urban areas of the North to escape poverty and racism. After the interruption 
of World War II, another 1.5 million African Americans migrated North between 1940 
and 1950, a trend that continued until about 1970.4 For communities of African Americans 
recently who migrated from, for example, rural South Carolina to take up work in Detroit, 
postvocalic r-lessness was most likely a way to emphasize their solidarity and common 
history. 
Recently linguists have argued for a more anthropological approach to the study of 
this kind of variation. Michael Silverstein (2003) proposed the concept of indexical order 
as an alternate way of studying language variation and change. Rather than assigning 
precise meanings to any given variable, for example, (r) deletion, it is more revealing and 
potentially more useful to think of variables as existing within a pool or ﬁeld of potential 
meanings. Eckert (2008) has called this a “constellation of ideologically related meaning 
. . . The field is fluid, and each new activation has the potential to change the field by 
building on ideological connections.” In a traditional sociolinguistic study, data would 
be analyzed quantitatively and the linguist would make observations. For example, the 
researcher might point to statistics to establish that the substitution of variant x for variant 
y is being propelled by adolescent males (or resisted by women of child-bearing age, etc.). 
The weakness of this approach is the way the focus on statistics has come to preclude 
study of less quantifiable aspects of language use. Thus a statement like this change 
in progress is being led by middle-aged women says nothing about the kinds of behavior 
and ideologies that underlie these patterns, what kinds of meaning people attach to 
the conservative and innovative variant, who does and does not ﬁt the pattern and why 
(ibid.: 455).

33 
Such a methodology would require a long period of observation to pinpoint those social 
categories which are truly relevant to the community in question, rather than simply trying 
to force the data into preconceived rubrics for class, ethnicity, race, etc. Eckert and Wenger 
point out that it is not social groups per se that are relevant to understanding distributions, 
but the “stances, activities and qualities” associated with those groups (2005: 584). 
Variable postvocalic (r) is very complex and not quite what it seems on the surface: it’s 
not that all well-educated or socially ambitious people in New York (or Boston, etc.) simply 
give in to rhoticity; there is an ebb and ﬂow in way (r) is evaluated, adopted or rejected. 
The Northern Cities Chain Shift (NCCS) 
The Northern Cities Chain Shift (NCCS) involves the phonological system – speciﬁcally 
six vowels – which are shifting in a kind of domino effect in a large part of the Midwest 
(Gordon 2001). 
Figure 2.6 is an abstraction of the shape of the human mouth which indicates the point 
of articulation for individual vowels. Any vowel can be described by its place of articulation 
(although a close transcription requires additional features be identiﬁed). To the right of 
the International Phonetic Alphabet’s vowels are examples of each sound as it is realized 
in my own variety of English. 
The linguistics lab at the University of Pennsylvania has been the site of many large-
scale studies of change in progress, but the biggest and most exhaustive study, still ongoing, 
probably is the NCCS study. Simply put, six vowels are on the move, as seen in Figures 
2.7 and 2.8. 
The ﬁrst stage of the series of shifts began sometime in the mid-twentieth century, most 
likely with the raising, tensing, and diphthongization of /æ/ (as in bad) moving toward the 
diphthong /I@/. If you say be + at together quickly, you’ll end up with the shifted version 
of bat (bæt > bI@t). Another example: the woman’s name Ann is pronounced like the man’s 
name Ian where the NCCS has taken place. 
As the ﬁrst stage of the change goes forward and /æ/ moves out and into the diphthong 
system, the empty spot begins to be ﬁlled with the second stage shift, /A/ > /æ/, and so on. 
In a series of phonological changes like this we talk about a chain, as if vowels fell in a neat

line, one after the other. In fact, it’s a messy, drawn-out business that can only really be 
examined once it’s well underway. 
Sociolinguists are especially interested in how the stages of the NCCS relate to each 
other, and how they are motivated. Is there a social group who is driving the shift? Does 
it have to do with age or gender or economics or some complex interaction of all these 
and other social markers? For the NCCS, the questions are especially intriguing because 
the chain shift is such a large one (about 34 million people are taking part, in some or all 
parts), over a very large geographic area, and it’s been gaining speed for a long time.

In my mid-twenties I moved from Chicago (where I was born and raised) to New Jersey. 
It was at that point that my own participation in the NCCS was terminated. By that I mean 
that because I was no longer living in a NCCS community, I was no longer exposed and 
thus I was immune to the social forces and pressures behind the shifts. Now, some twenty-
ﬁve years later, I talk to friends still living on the Northwest side of Chicago once in a 
while, and it’s always a bit of a surprise – even a shock – to hear how far the NCCS has 
progressed in the time I’ve been gone. I pronounce block with /A/, but the people I grew 
up with now say it with /æ/, which to me sounds like the word black. 
It’s important to remember that a series of shifts like the NCCS rolls along well below 
the level of consciousness. No one makes a decision to participate or not participate. Of 
course, changes (in whole or part) can be and will be resisted, but by groups rather than 
individuals. For example, race and ethnicity have something to do with whether an 
individual participates in the NCCS, as Gordon established in a study of speakers in North-
West Indiana (2000: 122). He found evidence that participation in the chain shift “generally 
serves to distinguish the speech of whites from that of Mexicans and African Americans.” 
Changes in progress proceed in tiny steps that go unnoticed by the participants until 
large-scale restructuring of the vowel system has become so distinctive that it begins to 
be identiﬁed with a particular geographic area. For example, many people today would 
say that Chicago has a distinctive accent; twenty-ﬁve years ago, it did not. That is, the 
NCCS has advanced to the point that people have come to notice it;5 before this point, 
Chicago was just “Midwestern” English. 
The NCCS is a hugely complex set of changes distributed over time, space and a dozen 
different social categories. You may be deeply invested in it, yourself. 
Lexical variation 
People are often quite aware of variation in word choice. Good-natured arguments about 
who says tennis shoe and who says sneaker are not uncommon. In Southeast Michigan, there 
are often classroom discussions on the use of pop (the variant most likely found farther 
West) versus soda (the variant found to the East) versus coke (the South). Michigan would 
seem to be on the boundary (or isogloss) between soda and pop; thus the spirited discus-
sions. Such distinct variants over space are generally referred to as isoglosses; a bundle of 
isoglosses is a strong indicator that people on one side of the bundle consider themselves 
different (at least linguistically) from people on the other side of the bundle. The individual 
isoglosses seen in Figure 2.9 are primarily lexical. These include Dutch cheese (North of 
the bundle) and its equivalent, cottage cheese (South of the bundle) and (similarly) whinny 
(North) versus whicker or nicker (South). 
Sociolinguists ﬁnd this kind of variation less compelling, unless there is correlation to 
other points of variation which are more linguistically, socially or geographically complex. 
There are also lexical items which function as discourse markers, however, and which 
are so complex in structural, social and stylistic terms that linguists spend a lot of time 
studying them (Barbieri 2009; Cukor-Avila 2002; Dailey-O’Cain 2000; Rickford et al. 
2007; Tagliamonte and D’Arcy 2004).6 Some terms (like, you know, well, and but) show us 
“how speakers and hearers jointly integrate forms, meanings, and actions to make overall 
sense out of what is said” (Schiffrin 1987: 49). 
A particularly interesting discourse marker is like, which can be used in more than one 
way. As a focuser, like draws attention to a particular aspect of a sentence, as in “Well, it’s

regions

not like wonderful, but it’s okay” (Dailey-O’Cain 2000: 61). More commonly like (as a 
discourse marker) is a quotative and thus serves to signal a change in the source of the 
narrative: “My dad was constantly down on me. It’s like, ‘Get a job’” (ibid.: 62). At ﬁrst 
glance it would seem that this must be nothing more than a random phenomenon and 
devoid of any signiﬁcance, but that is not the case. For example, Dailey-O’Cain found that 
people talked one way about this use of like (“bad grammar”) but did not necessarily 
evaluate speakers who used it negatively. Age always played an important role in both the 
use and perception of quotative like. 
Rickford’s (2007) study found distinct changes over time for the quotatives in both 
speech and popular media (chat, blogs, discussion boards) in California (Figure 2.10): 
Sometimes an English language usage may seem to be unimportant or even trivial; 
certainly in this case, quotatives often invite mocking and humor. However, close

37 
Figure 2.10 The use of quotative discourse markers over time in California

study of this kind of subtle marker can reveal a great deal about the community of 
speakers who use it. 
Sociolinguists like to study quotatives for another reason. Whereas a vowel shift or a 
consonant cluster simpliﬁcation7 might stretch out over decades and require many years 
of study, quotatives change quickly. You may have observed this in your own speech or 
in the speech of those around you. 
Variation in verb morphology: strong and weak verbs 
Most English verbs fall into one of two groups: strong or weak. Weak (also called regular 
verbs) form the past tense and the past participle by the simple addition of a sufﬁx (for 
example, -ed, talked, smacked, climbed, cleaned). Strong or irregular verbs are much harder 
to predict because the past forms are generated by a change to the vowel in the root 
syllable, and sometimes to consonants as well, for example, shrink, shrank, shrunk. Bybee 
and Slobin (1982) summarize the history and relationship between weak and strong verbs, 
and establish that while there are thousands of verbs that fall into the weak (-ed) class, 
only two hundred or so can be identiﬁed as strong. On the other hand, “of the 30 most 
frequent past-tense forms, 22 are irregular [strong]” (1982: 265). Since the Old English 
period, hundreds of strong verbs have weakened, for example.

You might hypothesize that this movement from strong to weak verbs would be over and 
done with so many hundreds of years after it began, but in fact, it is still moving for-
ward – and backward. Pinker’s summary of the status of strong or irregular verbs is quite 
poetic: 
Do irregular verbs have a future? At ﬁrst glance, the prospects do not seem good. Old 
English had more than twice as many irregular verbs as we do today. Not only is the

----- Page 63 (native) -----

irregular class losing members by emigration, it is not gaining new ones by immi-
gration. When new verbs enter English via onomatopoeia (to ding, to ping), borrow-
ings from other languages (deride and succumb from Latin), and conversions from 
nouns (ﬂy out), the regular rule has ﬁrst dibs on them. The language ends up with 
dinged, pinged, derided, succumbed, and ﬂied out, not dang, pang, derode, succame, or 
ﬂew out. 
(Pinker 1998) 
Weak verbs have been metamorphizing into strong verb forms for a very long time. 
Pinker attributes this to the fact that strong verbs are generated by pattern, and human 
beings are prone to playing with patterns. Studies of children’s speech regularly shows 
how they experiment, trying strong verb patterns on weak verbs (and weak on strong) to 
see how they’ll fit. Bybee and Slobin provide examples from children’s speech: bring– 
brang, bite–bote, and wipe–wope, but anyone who has had a part in raising a child will 
have their own examples. From the notes taken while my daughter was in this stage of 
language acquisition, for example: He tooked Eliza’s book, Her dress is all broked, and Look I 
clumed the stairs barefeeted. 
Adults ﬁnd misapplications like these endearing or funny, but sometimes a strong rule 
pattern will stick to a weak verb. For example, there are areas in Great Britain and the 
U.S. where sneaked has become snuck, dived is now dove, and dragged is drug, to the horror 
of prescriptivists. In my own speech, snuck and dove are ﬁrmly entrenched. 
This variation is active and vigorous, and has been widely documented. A Google search 
“dragged or drug?” brings up a million hits, which indicates real confusion in the language 
community. Speakers often show this kind of confusion and breakdown of contrasts when 
changes in progress are solidifying. An infamous example of such a case is the difference 
between lie and lay, a distinction that is now largely lost. 
There are many other kinds and points of variation in the verb systems of American 
English, some of which have been tracked for a long time. For instance, the data for A 
Survey of Verb Forms in the Eastern United States (Atwood 1953) was collected at least ﬁve 
years earlier, or some 60 years ago. Atwood noted variation in distribution of the preterite 
and past participles in many verbs. Figure 2.11 is one of the maps from his atlas, this one 
showing the distribution of past tense variants for the verb to drink. In my own variety of 
American English, drink is a solidly strong verb (We drink Kool-Aid; we drank Kool-Aid) 
but there are areas where the verb is weak (We drinked Kool-Aid). 
Verbs are a particular point of contention for most prescriptivists. My great-aunt Lillian 
used to wag her ﬁnger at me and intone “You may not abuse past participles in my home.” 
Most likely you’ve had an experience something like this with a relative or teacher. 
Structured variation: the hidden life of language 
The examples of variation in language presented here might seem, at ﬁrst glance, to be 
obvious and uncomplicated. In fact, sociolinguistic variation can be exceedingly complex 
and require advanced statistical techniques to tease out patterns. 
Human beings choose among thousands of points of variation available to them not 
because the human mind is sloppy, or language is imprecise: just the opposite. We exploit 
linguistic variation available to us in order to send a complex series of messages about 
ourselves and the way we position ourselves in the world. We perceive variation in the

39

speech of others and we use it to structure our knowledge about that person. Listening to 
strangers calling into talk radio programs, it is more than verb morphology and vowel 
sounds that we evaluate, more than the content of their comments than we walk away 
with. 
“What’s a Dago know about the price of oil?” my father asked once while listening to 
an anonymous caller to a talk-radio program rant about the gasoline crunch in the late 
1970s. My father, a native speaker of Italian, recognized the caller as socially and ethnically 
similar to himself and made a series of evaluations. We all have experiences like this: if 
you’re far from home and in a crowd you hear someone who talks like you do, your 
attention turns in that direction. 
The parameters of linguistic variation are multidimensional. In large-scale terms, these 
are social, stylistic, geographic, or temporal, and in any one case of active variation, more

----- Page 65 (native) -----
40 
LANGUAGE IN MOTION 
than one of these factors is probably at play. Different factors interact with each other, 
and with language-internal inﬂuences; the result is the variation you hear (or don’t hear, 
but perceive). 
When we choose among variants available to us – a process which happens well below 
the level of consciousness – we use those language signals that will mark us as belonging 
to speciﬁc social groupings, and distance us from others. We do this sometimes even when 
we are trying not to (in the next chapters we will return to this very relevant subject of 
mutability of language). 
Individuals situate themselves in relationship to others; the way they group themselves, 
the powers they claim for themselves and the powers they stipulate to others are all 
embedded in language. Sociolinguistics becomes complicated (and gains in potential 
usefulness) as soon as we recognize that socially marked linguistic features only begin with 
geography, gender and age. Language markers can be emblematic for dozens of different 
kinds of social allegiances. National origin, socioeconomic class, ethnicity, occupation, 
religion, occupation, kinship: all these things and many more might be signaled linguisti-
cally. To add to this complexity, topic and setting put their own demands on variation. 
This is what sociolinguists do: they look at active, socially structured variation to try to 
understand the process of language change. How it is initiated, how it moves, what it 
means. We try to identify universals in the power and solidarity structures which are 
relevant to language communities of all types, from inner city neighborhoods to remote 
Indonesian villages. And that is where sociolinguistics usually stops. Once we have under-
stood, for example, the social correlates of caught/cot variation in Buffalo – the way changes 
in transportation and communication have effected diffusion of this change over genera-
tions – the job is done. We rarely ask why these facts are the way they are; traditionally, 
anthropological linguists pick up at this point. 
We know who stigmatizes and avoids r-lessness in Manhattan and the South; we know 
who clings to it despite stigmatization, but we do not understand what the process itself 
is. Fairclough points this out as an unfortunate omission, and outlines questions he thinks 
should follow: 
How – in terms of the development of social relationships to power – was the existing 
sociolinguistic order brought into being? How is it sustained? And how might it be 
changed to the advantage of those who are dominated by it? 
(Fairclough 1989 [2001]: 7–8) 
Sociolinguists have demonstrated beyond a doubt that variation is an intrinsic and 
functional feature of the spoken language. So then, what do people really mean when they 
talk about nonstandard or substandard or *SAE? How do these labels get attached to 
speciﬁc points of variation, and to what end? Before we pursue those issues, we need to 
consider terminology, starting with the idea of accent.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
Consider the Salvucci map online: http://www.evolpub.com/Americandialects/Am 
DialMap.html, and read the descriptions he provided for each dialect area. How do they 
compare with your own understanding of the regional varieties of American English? 
Think you have a pretty good handle on American dialects? Try the synonym quizzes on 
the website of the Dictionary of American Regional English, http://dare.wisc.edu/?q= 
node/20. 
At the Harvard American Dialect Survey you will find the list of points of variation in 
American English that was included in that study. This is by no means a complete list of 
changes in progress, but there’s quite a lot there. Before looking at the website and 
maps, identify three points of variation that you were aware of (in your own speech, or 
the speech of others you know) and three that you were not aware of. 
Look at the Dialect Map of /tOk/ “talk” from the University of Texas linguistics department: 
http://www.utexas.edu/courses/linguistics/resources/socioling/talkmap/index.html and 
listen to the sound clips. Can you identify the vowels used in each geographic area? Can 
you hear the differences? 
A university or college campus often draws people from all over the country. Drawing on 
the diversity available to you for sampling, design a simple ﬁeld study in which you look 
for the vowels in cot and caught, and map what you ﬁnd. Where are the vowels distinct? 
Where are they merged? You might want to use Labov’s (r) study as a model. 
Attached to the Wikipedia page for the Northern Cities vowel/chain shift is a “talk” page 
where people can comment or make suggestions about the article. A series of comments 
from late 2010 includes the following reaction to the idea of the shift itself. How does 
this illustrate the concepts introduced thus far on standard language ideology? 
I’m Ohio born and raised and I’ve never come across this, I think this whole 
thing is BS. The people on TV still sound exactly like us, I can’t think of any 
person I’ve ever met who has started or had changed into the ﬁrst shift, more 
prevalent is rural people saying warsh. Are there any examples or a video of 
people with this “shift”? . . . I know for a fact that I don’t have a discernible 
accent and neither do most people I know. 
Consider the usage of usta (as in the sentence I usta go out on Saturday nights, but 
now I’m broke). Is it a verb, and if so, is it past or present tense? The answer is more 
complex and interesting than you might imagine, and you can read about it on Language 
Log, with this entry by Mark Liberman: http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2756. 
Galileo was the mathematician and astronomer who ﬁrst observed that the earth revolves 
around the moon. This did not sit well with the Catholic Church, which taught that the 
earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved about it. They forced Galileo 
to recant his position, but afterward he is said to have mumbled (rebelliously) Eppur’ si 
muove: And yet, it moves. How does this episode parallel the way people think about 
language in the present day?

1  “Nevertheless, it moves.” See discussion topics in this chapter. 
2  To look at this another way, some people see the broadcast media as immensely 
powerful and inﬂuential. So powerful, in fact, that the whole country is simply com-
pelled to follow their example. This subject is pursued in greater depth in Chapter 8. 
3  Please note the following notation conventions: slash brackets as in /r/ refer to 
phonemes; square brackets [r] to allophones; and parentheses (r) to sociolinguistic 
variables. The distinction between phoneme and allophone is a basic and a crucial one 
in phonetics and phonology, but will not be stressed here. For our purposes, it is 
enough to remember that (r) means the discussion focuses on sociolinguistic variation, 
while /r/ and [r] are references to the actual sounds (or classes of sound).

5  Those who study accent as a phonetic and sociolinguistic phenomenon have come to 
the conclusion that accent can only really be defined from the perspective of the 
listener. 
6  Some quotatives are also used as intensiﬁers, as for example in “My mom is all mad 
at me.” 
7  Consonant cluster reduction or simplification is common to many – even most – 
varieties of U.S. English. In the Midwest, a nasal (/n/ or /m/) followed by a stop 
(/b/ /p/ /t/ /d/) will usually reduce to a nasal alone, as in the word hunter which is 
pronounced hunner. This feature is so widespread that it is considered a vernacular 
universal: a feature that occurs regularly across stigmatized or peripheralized language 
varieties are proposed to be features of the human language faculty.

The myth of non-accent 
3 
The poets were not alone in sanctioning myths, for long before the poets the states 
and the lawmakers had sanctioned them as a useful expedient . . . They needed to 
control the people by superstitious fears, and these cannot be aroused without myths 
and marvels. 
Strabo (64 BC–AD 26), Geographia 
You’ve got one too 
Myth is understood broadly as a story with general cultural signiﬁcance. In the study of 
myth, veracity is secondary to the way in which a story symbolizes human experience more 
generally. What is particularly interesting is the way that myths are used to justify social 
order, and to encourage or coerce consensual participation in that order.1 
In general, linguists think of standard language and its corollary, non-accent, as 
abstractions. And in fact, this is a logical connection, as is borne out by the Oxford English 
Dictionary’s deﬁnition: “[an abstraction is] the idea of something which has no independent 
existence; a thing which exists only in idea; something visionary.” From this follows quite 
neatly Milroy and Milroy’s suggestion that standard language should not be understood 
as any speciﬁc language, but as “an idea in the mind rather than a reality – a set of abstract 
norms to which actual usage may conform to a greater or lesser extent” (1985: 22–23). 
For our purposes, it is useful to consider both standard language and non-accent as myths. 
It is only by doing so that we can come to understanding how the collective consciousness 
came to be. Myths are magical and powerful constructs; they can motivate social behavior 
and actions which would be otherwise contrary to logic or reason. 
We have come a good way into this discussion without deﬁning the term accent. Perhaps 
the reason for that is clear by now: in so far as linguists are concerned, the term has no 
technical or speciﬁc meaning. It is widely used by the public, however, in interesting ways. 
In a more technical sense, accent is used to distinguish stress in words (The accent is on 
the second syllable in baNAna) or intonation in sentences (“That’s ANOTHER ﬁne mess 
you’ve gotten us into!”); it can be used as a diacritic, but this is most often done in con-
junction with the writing of other languages. More generally, accent is a loose reference 
to a speciﬁc “way of speaking.” There is no ofﬁcial or technical speciﬁcation for what this 
might mean in linguistic terms, but there are two widely recognized elements to what 
serves to distinguish one variety of a language from another in the minds of speakers: 
Prosodic features. The study of the phonology of a language includes consideration of 
intonation, or patterns of pitch contours. This includes stress patterns, both at the 
lexical and at the sentence level, but it also touches upon other factors such as tempo 
of speaking. For example, speakers of English tend to call languages or varieties of

language which tend toward an upswing in stress at the end of words lilting, or sing-
song, or some Romance languages rapid-ﬁre. Currently in American English there 
is one very active point of variation having to do with stress, in a small set of words 
including Thanksgiving, insurance, adult, cement. 
2  
It seems that ﬁrst syllable stress has been documented for these words in the South, 
while everywhere else in the country the stress is on the second syllable: INsurance 
(South) or inSURance (elsewhere). The first syllable variant has been showing up 
outside the South quite a lot over at least the past 20 years, which is when I started 
taking notes on it. The other words that follow this pattern in the South do not seem 
to be wandering North; my casual research has not uncovered use of THANKSgiving, 
A-dult, CEment or UMbrella on the West Coast, in the Midwest or on the East Coast.2

Segmental features. We acquire, as part of our ﬁrst language, the sounds of the language 
which fall into two major categories: vowels and consonants. Each of these sounds 
exists in relation to one another in a phonological structure. In the discussion above, 
some speakers of U.S. English distinguish between the words caught and cot, while for 
others these are homonyms. This follows quite reasonably from the fact that there 
are many possible phonological systems for U.S. English. 
Perspective 
Linguists have struggled to find an accurate definition of the word accent, and for the 
most part, given it up as a bad job. Generally accent can only be understood and deﬁned 
if there is something to compare it with. You travel to a small town in Kansas, and (unless 
you are actually from that area), your accent will be seen as the differences between your 
speech and the local speech. Those differences can be examined and identiﬁed, so that a 
linguist might make a study of how your prosodic features and phonology mark you as 
someone from someplace else. The “someplace else” can be another state, country, or 
social group. 
Those who work on accent as a phonetic and sociolinguistic phenomenon seem to have 
come to the conclusion that while this is true, it is also not important. That is, in the serious 
study of accent, the object is not what comes out of one person’s mouth, but what the 
listeners hear and understand. Derwing and Monro put it very simply: “From our 
perspective, listeners’ judgments are the only meaningful window into accentedness and 
comprehensibility” (2009: 478). 
And yet, it is important to distinguish between the two major kinds of accents: First 
Language (L1) and Second Language (L2). 
L1 and L2 accents 
What we call L1 accent is really no more than what we have been discussing all along: 
structured variation in language. Most usually we use geography as the ﬁrst line of demar-
cation: a Maine accent, a New Orleans accent, an Appalachian accent, a Utah accent. But 
there are also socially bound clusters of features which are superimposed on the geo-
graphic: Native American accents, Black accents, Jewish accents. Gender, race, ethnicity, 
income, religion – these and other social identities are often clearly marked by means of 
choice between linguistic variants.

----- Page 71 (native) -----
46 
THE MYTH OF NON-ACCENT 
L1 accent is, then, the native variety of U.S. English spoken: every native speaker of 
U.S. English has an L1 accent, no matter how unmarked or marked the person’s language 
may seem to be. This includes people like Rachel Maddow, Steven Colbert, Bill Maher, 
Bill O’Reilly and Ann Coulter, broadcast news and commentary personalities who are 
generally thought to be speakers of *SAE. 
So where does accent end and dialect begin?3 To be more specific: Why is Dutch 
considered a separate language from German, and Swiss German not? Why do people 
call the variety of English that many African Americans speak Black slang (or a Black accent 
or African American English) but call Cockney and Gullah dialects? Max Weinreich is 
widely quoted as pointing out that a language is a dialect with an army and a navy; I would 
like to add to that observation that a dialect is perhaps nothing more than a language that 
gets no respect. That is to say that these questions are really about politics and history. The 
features of the languages being discussed are secondary. However, if it is necessary to 
distinguish between accent and language variety on purely linguistic terms, then a rough 
division can be made as follows: 
Two varieties of a single language are distinguished by accent when differences are 
restricted primarily to phonology (prosodic and segmental features). 
If two varieties of a single language also differ in morphological structures, syntax, 
lexicon, and semantics, then they are different varieties, or dialects, of the same 
language. 
If two varieties of a common mother language differ in all these ways, and in addition 
have distinct literary histories, distinct orthographies, and/or geo-political boundaries, 
then they are generally called different languages. 
Style or code shifting is a term reﬂecting the speaker’s ability to switch between languages 
or language varieties dependent on a large number of factors. It is a complicated process, 
and one that has been studied intensively. For our purposes, however, it is enough to say 
that when a speaker is shifting between two varieties of one language which are closely 
related, it will sometimes be appropriate to speak of “accent” and sometimes of “variety.” 
Thus it is useful to retain the term accent to talk about phonology, but it is important to 
remember that this is a ﬂuid category. 
L2 accent is very different. When a native speaker of a language other than English 
learns English, accent is used to refer to the breakthrough of native language phonology 
into the target language. Thus we might say that an individual has a Welsh accent, or a 
Tagalog accent, because the phonologies of those languages influence the learner’s 
pronunciation of U.S. English, and any effort to block the L2 accent will be accomplished 
with differing degrees of success. 
Thus far it has been put forward that: 
all spoken human language is necessarily and functionally variable; 
one of the functions of variation is to convey social, stylistic and geographic meaning; 
the majority of the emblematic work of variation is carried out below the level of 
consciousness. 
Given these facts, what is non-accent? And given the fact that accent is just shorthand for 
variable language (which is in some ways a redundant term), what can a ‘standard’ U.S. 
English be, but an abstraction?

----- Page 72 (native) -----
THE MYTH OF NON-ACCENT 
47 
In spite of all the hard evidence that all languages change, people steadfastly believe
that a homogenous, standardized, one-size-ﬁts-all language is not only desirable, it is truly
a possibility. This takes us back to our opening science fiction scenario, in which the
positive ramifications of a world in which we are all the same size and weight is so
appealing, so enticing, that we overlook biological realities and the laws of physics. 
Before we go on to ask how we are able to fool ourselves so thoroughly about language,
we must first deal more carefully with the question of the mythical homogenous stan-
dardized spoken language. Until the impossibility of such a thing is established uncon-
trovertibly, people will continue to pine after it, and, worse, to pursue it. 
So, can you lose one accent and replace it with another? A linguist’s ﬁrst impulse is to
answer this question, very simply, no. It is not possible for an adult to substitute his native
phonology (one accent) for another, consistently and in a permanent way.4 But! The non-
linguist will jump in. What about my Aunt Magda, who came here from the Ukraine and
has no accent at all? What about Gwyneth Paltrow, who can switch from American English
to British English without a moment’s hesitation? And there’s Joe’s wife, who just gave
up her Brooklyn accent when it caused her problems in medical school. 
What does it mean to lose an accent? Are we talking about replacing one way of speaking
for another, or adding a new phonology to a person’s existing inventory? Are we demand-
ing that a person sound one way for a brief period of time, or that he always sound that
way? Consider a man who applies for a promotion and is told that his accent is too low-
class for the job he wants to do. 
James Kahakua, a native of Hawai’i, wanted to read prepared weather forecasts on the
radio. He was refused promotion because his English marks him as a speaker of Hawai’ian
Creole. When he sued, the radio station called an accent reduction specialist to testify on
their behalf. The accent reduction specialist didn’t mince words: Kahakua’s English was
deﬁcient, wrong, unacceptable. Even given the demands of the job in question – rapid
pronunciation of long and complex Native Hawai’ian language place names, the specialist
(and the judge) found that Mr. Kahakua’s bilingualism was a disadvantage the employer
shouldn’t have to tolerate. (A televised report on the Kahakua Title VII case can be seen
at http://goo.gl/k12Bp.) 
Accent reduction specialists like the one who testified in the Kahakua case are not
objective parties. Such persons have a vested interest in the idea of accent and standard. If
an accent reduction specialist could not convince the court that Mr. Kahakua’s Hawai’ian
accent was wrong and inappropriate, what would that mean for her career? 
Answers for all of these questions require a closer understanding of language acquisition.
We begin with some generalizations which are more linguistic facts of life: 
There is a ﬁnite set of potentially meaning-bearing sounds (vowels, consonants, tones)
which can be produced by human vocal apparatus. The set in its entirety is universal,
available to all human beings without physical handicap. 
Each language uses some, but not all, sounds available. 
Sounds are organized into systems, in which each element stands in relationship to
the other elements (phonology). The same inventory of sounds can be organized into
a number of possible systems. Children are born with the ability to produce the entire
set of possible sounds, but eventually restrict themselves to the ones they hear used
around them. 
Children exposed to more than one language during the language acquisition process
may acquire more than one language, if the social conditioning factors are favorable.

----- Page 73 (native) -----
48 
THE MYTH OF NON-ACCENT 
At some time in adolescence, the ability to acquire language with the same ease as 
young children atrophies.5 
There are as yet poorly understood elements of cognition and perception which have 
to do with the degree of success with which an adult will manage to acquire a new 
phonology, or accent. In summary, the phenomenon that we call a foreign accent is a 
complex aspect of language that affects speakers and listeners in both perception and 
production and, consequently, in social interaction (Derwing and Munro 2005: 379). 
These are very dry facts. Let’s approach this in another way. 
The Sound House 
First, think of all the sounds which can be produced by the human vocal apparatus as a set 
of building materials. The basic materials, vowels and consonants, are bricks. Other 
building materials (wood, mortar, plaster, stone) stand in for things like tone, vowel 
harmony, and length, which are part of the articulation of vowels and consonants, but 
provide another layer of meaning-bearing sound in many languages. Thus far, we are 
talking about phonetics: the production and perception of the full set of possible sounds. 
Children are born with two things: a set of language blueprints wired into the brain, 
which gives them some intuitive understanding of very basic rules of language. They also 
have a set of tools which goes along with these blueprints. 
Now think of the language acquisition process as a newborn who begins to build a Sound 
House. The Sound House is the “home” of the language, or what we have been calling 
accent – the phonology – of the child’s native tongue. At birth the child is in the Sound 
House warehouse, where a full inventory of all possible materials is available to her. She 
looks at the Sound Houses built by her parents, her brothers and sisters, by other people 
around her, and she starts to pick out those materials, those bricks she sees they have used 
to build their Sound Houses. She may experiment with other bricks, with a bit of wood, 
but in the end she settles down to duplicating the Sound Houses she sees around her. She 
sets up her inventory of sounds in relationship to each other; she puts up walls, plans the 
space: she is constructing her phonology. 
The blueprints tell her that she must have certain supporting structures; she does this. 
She wanders around in her parents’ Sound Houses and sees how they do things. She makes 
mistakes; ﬁxes them. In the process, she makes small innovations. 
Maybe this child has parents who speak English and Gaelic, or who are natives of 
Cincinnati and speak what they think of as standard American English, as well as African 
American English Vernacular. The parents each have two Sound Houses, or perhaps one 
Sound House with two wings. She has two houses to build at once. Sometimes she mixes 
materials up, but then sorts them out. Maybe she builds a bridge between the two struc-
tures. Maybe a connecting courtyard. 
The child starts to socialize with other children. Her best friend has a slightly different 
layout, although he has built his Sound House with the exact same inventory of building 
materials. Another friend has a Sound House which is missing the back staircase. She wants 
to be like her friends, and so she makes renovations to her Sound House. It begins to looks 
somewhat different from her parents’ Sound Houses; it is more her own. Maybe the Gaelic 
half of her Sound House is neglected, has a hole in the roof, a collapsing ﬂoor. Maybe she 
is at odds, because she loves her AAVE Sound House, but others criticize it as ugly and

----- Page 74 (native) -----
THE MYTH OF NON-ACCENT 
49 
not worthy to be called a house at all. She might eventually abandon the AAVE Sound 
House and pretend it never existed. Now imagine this. 
When the child turns 20, she notices another kind of Sound House, built by Spanish 
speakers, which she admires. She would like to build an extension to her own Sound House 
just like it. She looks for her blueprints and her tools, but they have disappeared. Puzzled, 
she stands on the street and looks at these Spanish Sound Houses. What is different about 
them? Look at that balcony. How do you build that? Why do the staircases look like that? 
With her bare hands, she sets out to build an extension to her original Sound House. 
She sees bricks she doesn’t have in her own inventory, but how to get back to the 
warehouse? She’ll have to improvise. She’s a smart woman, she can make a brick, cut down 
a tree. She examines the Sound Houses built by Spanish speakers, asks questions. The 
obvious things she sees right off: wow, they have ﬁreplaces. The less obvious things: width 
of the doors, for example, slip right by her at ﬁrst. She starts in on the long process. How 
did you build that chimney, she asks. I don’t know, says her informant, a native speaker 
of Spanish. I was a kid at the time, and I’ve lost my blueprints. 
If she’s lucky, she has a guide – an informed language teacher – who can point out the 
difference between the extension she is trying to build and her own Sound House. Look, 
this guide will say. You’re mixing up blue and ultramarine bricks! We use blue for this 
kind of wall, ultramarine for that. And you certainly can’t put a pale pink brick next to a 
cerise one. 
“Oh,” says the woman building the new Sound House. “I hadn’t noticed.” And thus she 
will begin to differentiate more carefully, for example, between two very similar vowels 
which are distinctive in the language she is learning. 
She works very, very hard on this extension. But no matter how hard she works, the 
balcony will not shape up; it is always rickety. There’s a gap in the ﬂoor boards; people 
notice it and grin. 
In absolute amazement, she watches her little sister build the exact same Sound House 
with no effort at all, and it is perfect. She points this out to her guide. “But your sister still 
has her blueprints and tools,” says her guide. Then she sees a stranger, an older man, 
building the same extension and he is also taking less time, just galloping through. His 
Spanish Sound House looks like an original to her. 
“Oh no,” her guide tells her. “It’s very good, no doubt, but look there – don’t you see 
that the windows are slightly too close together? It would fool almost everybody, but those 
windows give it away.” 
She digs in her heels and moves into the extension, although the roof still leaks. She 
abandons her original English Sound House for months, for years, she is so dedicated to 
getting this right. She rarely goes back to the ﬁrst Sound House anymore, and the Gaelic 
Sound House is condemned. When she does go back to the English Sound House, and 
ﬁrst goes through the door it seems strange to her. But the structural heart of her Sound 
House is here, and it’s still standing, if a little dusty. Very quickly she feels at home again. 
When people come to visit her in her Spanish Sound House, they are amazed to ﬁnd 
out that it’s not her ﬁrst construction. They examine everything closely. Some of them 
may notice very small details, but they don’t say anything. There’s the guy down the block, 
they tell her, he’s been working on the same extension for longer than you and he’ll never 
get it right. 
This is not a perfect analogy; it has no way to account for the acquisition of syntax and 
morphology, or the use or production of language. A house cannot produce anything. But 
it is a useful analogy nonetheless, in as much as this limitation is recognized.

THE MYTH OF NON-ACCENT 
Adult language learners all have the same handicap in learning a second language: the 
blueprints have faded to near illegibility, and the tools are rusted. We must all build new 
Sound Houses with our bare hands. When the judge claimed that there was no physio-
logical reason that James Kahakua could not speak the broadcast English the radio station 
demanded, he was simply wrong.6 
It is crucial to point out that the structural integrity of the targeted second Sound House 
– which here stands in for accent – is distinct from the language learner’s skill in actually 
using the target language. Accent has little to do with what is generally called communi-
cative competence, or the ability to use and interpret language in a wide variety of contexts 
effectively.7 
There is a long list of prominent persons who speak English as a second language and 
who never lost their accents. They never managed to build an English Sound House which 
would fool anybody into thinking that they are native speakers, but their ability to use 
English is clear. This group includes people like Isabel Allende, Derek Wolcott, Adriana 
Hufﬁngton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the irritable John Simon, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, 
who represent the political and socio-cultural mainstream, but who do it in an accented 
English. Do people like these choose to speak English with an accent? Have they not 
worked hard enough, long enough to sound American? Are they not smart enough? 
The same questions are relevant to native speakers of English with marked or 
stigmatized regional or social accents. When you think of Jimmy Carter, Jessie Jackson 
or Rosie O’Donnell, do we think of people who cannot express themselves? Whether you 
like or dislike them as individuals, they are all excellent communicators. Do they willfully 
refuse to give up Georgia, African American, or New York varieties of English for 
something less socially marked, or are they incapable of doing so? 
Because two phonologies are similar, we think it must be easier to build a second Sound 
House. Why can’t Mr. Kahakua – who after all has an English Sound House to begin with 
– just make a few adjustments that will transform it into what passes as a generic English 
Sound House? Stephen Moyer – a Brit born and raised – makes a very convincing Louisiana 
vampire on True Blood. Surely Mr. Kahakua could pull off sounding less Hawai’ian. 
The answer is, actors can’t automatically adopt a foreign accent, no matter how easy 
they make it look. In the ﬁlming process the camera rolls for short periods of time, and 
in a limited context. The actor has had coaching, most likely, from someone who is 
standing on the sidelines ready to pitch in if the actor’s accent begins to disintegrate. If 
the actor gets it wrong, they stop and try again. Under these favorable circumstances, 
many people could imitate another variety of English quite admirably – but for others, 
not even this is possible. 
There are many examples of actors criticized roundly for not pulling off an accent, in 
spite of expensive tutoring, and the possibility of many takes of each utterance. In either 
case, whether we have a very English Hugh Laurie who truly sounds – up on the screen 
– as if were a cranky doctor born and raised in the States (Fox’s House), or Dominic West 
– born in Yorkshire – who tries but fails to convince us that he is a tough Baltimore 
homicide detective (HBO’s The Wire), we are not talking about a permanent Sound House. 
These accents are fake store fronts that won’t stand up to a strong and persistent breeze. 
And it takes an exceptional talent (a subject to be raised shortly) to achieve even this limited 
amount. 
At a sociolinguistics conference some years ago, a colleague who studies the Northern 
Cities Chain Shift came to my presentation. Afterwards she said to me “You know, it was 
really fascinating to listen to you, – oh, and your talk was good too.” The whole time I

----- Page 76 (native) -----
THE MYTH OF NON-ACCENT 
51 
had been presenting my work, she had been listening closely to my vowels, and making 
notes to herself. When I was reading from prepared text, she told me, my vowels pretty 
much stayed put, but when I looked up from my papers and spoke extemporaneously, my 
vowels started to move: the chain shift in action. The more attention I pay to speech, the 
less I participate in the shift; this is an indication that some part of me feels compelled to 
move away from my background when I am speaking as an academic. But when I am 
involved in my subject, when I forget to monitor my speech carefully, my origins come 
forth: I am a native of Chicago, and I cannot pretend to be anything else. This has been 
pointed out to me by many non-linguists; people are proud to be able to listen to me (or 
to anybody else) for a minute and then put me on the map. 
All this happens in spite of the fact that my professional training has made me aware of 
the way I use subtle choices available to me, and in spite of the fact that sometimes I don’t 
particularly want to announce to the world where I am from. I have no choice but to live 
in the Sound House I ﬁrst created as a child, which bears the structural hallmarks of the 
social being I am. 
It is true, however, that some people are better at putting together second or even third 
and fourth Sound Houses in adulthood. Not perfect ones, but very good imitations. The 
differential ability to do this is something not very well understood, but strong circum-
stantial evidence indicates it has nothing to do with intelligence and not very much to do 
with how hard you work to learn the target language. On the other hand, it certainly does 
have something to do with cognition, and – for lack of a better or more precise term – 
with an ear for language. 
There are many published studies which underscore the relevance and importance of 
age (and hence, the critical language period) to the successful learning of a natively-
accented second language (Marx 2002; Munro et al. 2008; Munro and Mann 2005; Piske 
et al. 2001). The importance of other factors – length of residency (that is, exposure to 
L2), gender, formal instruction, and motivation – have not been sufﬁciently studied to 
draw any ﬁrm conclusions. Perhaps the most interesting factor is one that can hardly be 
studied in controlled circumstances, and that is what might be called talent. Early studies 
of possible links between musical ability have not established a connection, while other 
studies “have identiﬁed mimicry ability as a signiﬁcant predictor of degree of L2 foreign 
accent” (Piske et al. 2001: 202). 
Focused training – the process of drawing the adult language learner’s attention to 
elements in the production of speech sounds she would not otherwise notice – can have 
some effect. It is possible to adjust an accent, to some degree. We can work on that second 
Sound House, with guidance. But it is not possible to substitute the second Sound House 
for the original. Accent reduction courses, if they are well done by persons thoroughly 
trained in phonology and phonetics, who understand the structural differences between 
the languages, may help people learning English as a second language toward a better 
pronunciation. 
The true ability to build second and third Sound Houses past the language acquisition 
stage is undocumented. It may exist; there are certainly rumors enough of such persons, 
who as adults acquire another language with absolute and complete native fluency. A 
person who is capable of this would never let the phonology of their ﬁrst language interfere 
with their second language, regardless of the topic being discussed, or the amount of 
emotion brought to the table. Such a person would have to be able to stand up to close 
phonetic analysis of her language – and not just by phoneticians, but also by native 
speakers, who are incredibly sensitive to the subtle variation in language. Perhaps most

THE MYTH OF NON-ACCENT 
important, such a person would have to have complete control of the structured variation 
active in the target language. 
To understand the importance of this, imagine yourself in another country, speaking a 
language you have studied in school for a number of years. Not only do you have to keep 
the subjunctive straight, for example, but you should be able to interpret tone of voice and 
lexical choice. If you can’t interpret such language signals, you have no way of knowing if 
you are being taken seriously, or for a ride. 
If there are adults who are capable of learning to absolutely and cleanly substitute one 
accent for another, they are as rare as individuals who can do long division instantaneously 
in their heads, or have photographic memories. If they do exist, it would be interesting and 
important to study them, because it would seem that these are adults whose language acqui-
sition function – the hard wiring in the brain – failed to stop functioning at the usual time. 
If a person is very dedicated, works hard, and has good guidance, it may be possible to 
fool some of the people some of the time. But there’s a crucial question that hasn’t been 
asked yet: 
Who do we ask to jump through these hoops, and why? If *SAE is something logically 
and reasonably required of broadcast news reporters, why was it required of James 
Kahakua, and not of Peter Jennings (Canada) or Dan Rathers (Texas)? 
And, a more difﬁcult question: what is right or wrong about asking Mr. Kahakua to 
pretend? If he is capable of faking an accent, why shouldn’t his employer ask him to do 
this, for those few minutes he is reading the weather on the radio? 
A close and cynical reader of my arguments – of which there will be many – will point 
out that I have made two statements which seem to contradict each other. I have gone to 
some length to establish that all spoken language is variable, and that all languages change. 
Thus, the Sound Houses we build change over our lifetimes. At the same time, it seems 
that I am arguing that Sound Houses cannot be changed. I have been critical of speech 
therapists who claim this is possible. 
A Sound House is a living, evolving product of our minds, a mirror of our changing 
social beings. We redecorate constantly, with a keen eye for what the neighbors are doing. 
Little by little, we may move a wall, rearrange the bricks, add windows. One person builds 
a patio, and maybe that catches on, in the same way that somewhere, one day (in a way 
sociolinguists have never been able to observe) hundreds of other changes caught on and 
began to gain linguistic and social currency. 
We are all subject to the aging process; no one is exempt from those changes over time. 
Thus our Sound Houses do change over time but in ways which are outside direct control. 
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
What does the idea of style shifting do to the Sound House analogy? Many people are 
bilingual or multilingual, and for each language they also have multiple styles. Is there a 
way to adapt the metaphor to account for this, or does it simply break down? 
How many prominent people (politicians, actors, policy-makers, educators, media 
personalities, etc.) can you think of who speak English with an L2 accent? What impact 
does a foreign accent seem to have on the individual’s life?

----- Page 78 (native) -----
THE MYTH OF NON-ACCENT 
53 
Interview some friends or family – a group of three or four people – and try to elicit how 
they feel about different varieties of English and different L2 accents. Take notes. On 
what do they agree? Where do they differ? (One might ﬁnd accent x “friendly” while the 
other one ﬁnds it “unsophisticated,” for example.) Can you account for the differences, 
or lack of differences? What surprised you? 
What accents do you personally dislike or ﬁnd irritating? Describe a situation in which 
you reacted this way to a variety of English other than your own. After reading this far, 
do you have any insight into your own reactions? 
Think about this statement: Discrimination does not justify discrimination. How might this 
relate to the topic at hand? 
Do an internet search for “accent reduction” and “lose your accent.” What kind of articles 
and advertisements come up? What credentials do the people offering these courses 
have? Do you see any patterns? 
Notes 
1  The Oxford English Dictionary divides the use of myth into three domains: (1) purely 
ﬁctitious narratives which serve to illustrate and explain natural or social phenomena 
(The Legend of Hercules; Noah and the Ark); (2) fictional or imaginary persons, 
objects or places (Big Foot, Santa Claus, Shangri-La); and (3) untruths, or rumors.

3  Dialect is a term which linguists use primarily to talk about language differences over 
geographic space. It is, however, a fairly prickly term. Laypersons often associate the 
word dialect as something less developed, capable, or worthy, and hence always 
subordinate to a “real” language. This is an unfortunate and miscast use of the term 
and for that reason I avoid dialect more generally and use, as many linguists do, the 
term variety.

critical phase hypothesis, and the issue of accent, see Hyltenstam and Abrahamson 
(2000).

There is controversy among linguists about what has been called the critical period 
or the critical period hypothesis (CPH). Some linguists dismiss the concept entirely, 
and others have proposed amendments. In his chapter “Baby Born Talking – Describes 
Heaven,” Pinker summarizes the view of the majority of linguists: 
In sum, acquisition of a normal language is guaranteed for children up to the age 
of six, is steadily compromised from then until shortly after puberty, and is rare 
thereafter. Maturational changes in the brain, such as the decline in metabolic rate 
and number of neurons during the early school-age years, and the bottoming out 
of the number of synapses and metabolic rate around puberty, are plausible causes. 
We do know that the language-learning circuitry of the brain is more plastic in 
childhood; children learn or recover language when the left hemisphere of the brain 
is damaged or even surgically removed (though not quite at normal levels), but 
comparable damage in an adult usually leads to permanent aphasia.

The standard language myth 
4 
I therefore claim to show, not how men think in myths, but how myths operate in 
men’s minds without their being aware of the fact. 
Lévi-Strauss (1964) 
It should be clear by now why linguists consider the idea of a spoken standardized language 
to be a hypothetical construct. In his survey of the evolution of the concept of a standard, 
Crowley (2003) uses the term idealized language, which captures the sense of an honorable 
and rightful perfection. 
Not much has changed since Jonathan Swift wrote his “A proposal for correcting, 
improving and ascertaining the English tongue” (1712). Those who take it upon 
themselves to protect English from its speakers are still quite sure of their right to do so. 
James Kilpatrick is a modern-day example of someone who brings tremendous emotion 
and more than a little melodrama to what he clearly sees as a battle for the one true English: 
The lexicographer’s job is to distill the grapes of usage at the different levels. Thus, 
“he doesn’t go there anymore” conveys the same information that is transmitted by 
“he don’t go there no more,” but the one is standard American English and the other 
is not. 
Is the one “inferior” to the other? Of course. Who says so? This is the silent, common 
judgment of writers, editors, teachers and prescriptive lexicographers. The setting of 
standards in language is a contentious business, but somebody has to do it. Without 
standards, without deﬁnitions, without structural law, we lapse into linguistic anarchy. 
(Kilpatrick 1999) 
Google searches provide a sense of how large these issues loom in the minds of people 
more generally (Table 4.1). A survey of discussions on the topic of grammar brings up 
hundreds of examples. A large portion of them have not to do with grammar in the way 
it has been deﬁned here, but with matters of punctuation. No matter the topic, the tone 
can be affronted, sarcastic, condescending, servile and, on occasion, silly to the point of 
absurdity as in an unattributed adaptation of a Nazi poster originally designed for posting 
in Holland (Figure 4.1).

The idea of a standard language is constructed and re-constructed on an on-going basis 
by those who have a vested interest in the concept. At this juncture, it is necessary to 
consider in some detail exactly what this mythical beast called U.S. English is supposed 
to be.

Standard (American) English 
Non-linguists1 are quite comfortable with the idea of a standard language, so much so that 
the average person is very willing to describe and deﬁne it, much in the same way that 
most people could draw a unicorn, or describe a being from Star Trek’s planet Vulcan, or 
tell us who King Arthur was and why he needed a Round Table. For the most part people 
will undertake describing any of these even though they know that the thing they are 
describing is imaginary. That is, your description of a unicorn would be a great deal like 
everybody else’s, because the concept of a unicorn is a part of our shared cultural heritage. 
You picked up your mental image (a horse with a single pointed horn growing from its 
forehead) someplace along the line; most probably you don’t remember when or where. 
The same is true for what has been called, to this point, Standard American English. A 
comparison of published deﬁnitions for this term reveals some common themes. From 
Pocket Fowler’s Modern English Usage: 
Standard American English. The term has been variously defined and heavily 
politicized, but essentially it is the form of English that is most widely accepted and 
understood in an English-speaking country and tends to be based on the educated 
speech of a particular area . . . It is used in newspapers and broadcasting and is the 
form normally taught to learners of English. 
A more recent deﬁnition from Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary (2009), which proclaims itself 
The Voice of Authority: 
Standard American English: the English that with respect to spelling, grammar, 
pronunciation, and vocabulary is substantially uniform though not devoid of regional 
differences, that is well established by usage in the formal and informal speech and 
writing of the educated, and that is widely recognized as acceptable wherever English 
is spoken and understood.2 
Both deﬁnitions assume that the written and spoken language are equal, both in terms 
of how they are used, and how they should be used. Merriam-Webster sets spelling and 
pronunciation on common footing, and compounds this error by bringing in both formal 
and informal language use. 
While the deﬁnitions make some room for regional differences, they make none at all 
for social ones, and in fact, it is quite deﬁnite about the social construction of the hypo-
thetical standard: it is the language of the educated. 
What is meant by “educated” is left unstated and neither are the implications explored 
anywhere else in the dictionary. People who are not educated – whoever they may be – 
are drawn into the definition by its final component: “Standard American English is 
acceptable wherever English is spoken and understood.” The lexicographer assumes that 
those with lesser education will bow to the authority of those with more education, because 
that is what we are trained to do. 
Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary’s (2009) deﬁnition is more succinct, but it also 
draws on the idea of educated people as the source of acceptable English: “[The] language 
described as standard is the form of that language which is considered acceptable and 
correct by most educated users of it: Most announcers on the BBC speak Standard British 
English.”

----- Page 83 (native) -----
58 
THE STANDARD LANGUAGE MYTH 
More speciﬁc information on exactly how the lexicographer draws on the language of 
the educated is provided by interviews with the pronunciation editor at Merriam-Webster, 
which followed from the dictionary’s tenth edition. It falls to the pronunciation editor to 
decide which possible pronunciations are included in the dictionary, and how they are 
ordered. “Usage dictates acceptability,” he is reported as saying. “There is no other non-
arbitrary way to decide” (Nemy 1993). 
In order to pin down usage, the editor listens to “talk shows, medical shows, interviews, 
news, commentary, the weather” (ibid.) on the radio and on television. The editorial 
preface to the dictionary is more speciﬁc about this procedure; the list of those who are 
consulted about pronunciation includes politicians, professors, curators, artists, musicians, 
doctors, engineers, preachers, activists, and journalists: 
In truth, though, there can be no objective standard for correct pronunciation other 
than the usage of thoughtful and, in particular, educated speakers of English. Among 
such speakers one hears much variation in pronunciation . . . [our attempt is to] 
include all variants of a word that are used by educated speakers. 
(Merriam-Webster 2009: 83) 
The editors claim an objective standard (the language of the educated) and at the same 
time they acknowledge variation among educated speakers. This apparent inconsistency 
is resolved by the policy which includes all variants that are used by educated speakers. A 
close look at the pronunciations listed in the dictionary, however, indicates that this cannot 
be the case. An entry with three or more possible pronunciations is rare. If Merriam-
Webster’s Dictionary truly intends to include all pronunciations of the educated, then this 
deﬁnition of educated must be very narrow. 
The goal is to be representative, but how do the editors of the dictionary go about gather-
ing a representative sample? If the primary source of data comes from broadcast media, 
then the sample is very shallow indeed. How many people appear regularly in a forum which 
is broadcast to a wider audience? The lesser educated, who by the dictionary deﬁnition 
must constitute the greatest number of native speakers of English, are rarely heard from. 
Maybe there is no way to compile a dictionary which is truly descriptive in terms of 
pronunciation; maybe it is necessary to choose one social group to serve as a model. 
Perhaps there is even some rationale for using those with more education as this group. 
But there is nothing objective about this practice. It is the ordering of social groups in 
terms of who has authority to determine how language is best used. 
The rationale for this ordering derives at least in part from the perceived superiority of 
the written language. Persons with more education are more exposed to the written 
language and literary traditions; they may, in simple terms, be better writers than those 
with less education. Why this should mean that their pronunciation and syntax are some-
how more informed, more genuine, more authoritative – that is never made clear. 
Deﬁnitions of standard language supplied by people who do not edit dictionaries for a 
living echo many of the themes already established, but they sometimes become very 
speciﬁc. According to CompuServe (1995): *SAE is . . . 
having your nouns and your verbs agree.

one that few people would call either stilted or “low,” delivered with a voice neither 
guttural nor strident, clearly enunciated but not priggish about it, with no one sound 
having a noticeably distinctive character. It is a non-regional speech but clearly and 
easily understood in all regions . . . Standard American English uses, in general, only 
one syllable per enunciated vowel so most accents from the South and West are not 
to the pattern.3 
These references to the authority of educational institutions and unnamed experts 
correspond to the dictionary deﬁnitions in a fairly predictable way. Like the dictionary 
deﬁnitions, the written and spoken languages are being considered as one and the same 
thing. What is different about these personal definitions is the willingness to identify 
speciﬁc grammatical and phonological points which distinguish the hypothetical standard, 
and a highly emotional and personal element in the deﬁnitions. People feel strongly about 
language and will defend it: “In extreme cases . . . the tone is quasi-religious, even apoca-
lyptic . . . The ideological basis of the most extreme complaints . . . is authoritarian and, 
seemingly, transcendental” (Milroy 1999: 20). 
The most extreme ideological deﬁnitions of standard language come from those who 
make a living promoting the concept. Writers like Edwin Newman, John Simon and James 
Kilpatrick have published extensively on how English should be spoken and written. They 
do not address the source of their authority directly; that is taken for granted. They assume 
you will grant them authority because they demand it, and because it has always been 
granted. These men, and other men and women like them, have made careers for them-
selves as prescriptivists because they meet a demand they created. 
The social domain of the standard has been established: it is the language of the 
educated, in particular those who have achieved a high level of skill with the written 
language (the lack of logic here will be discussed later) or those who control the written 
or broadcast media. However, this attempt at a simple deﬁnition of *SAE begins to falter 
when language variation over space is added to the mix. 
Dennis Preston has compiled a body of empirical studies in which he has quantiﬁed and 
summarized non-linguists’ beliefs about the geographic distribution of a standard 
language. In “Where they speak correct English,” he asked 76 young white natives of 
Southern Indiana to rank all 50 states as well as New York City and Washington, DC. 
The best English was 1, and the worst, 52. Figure 4.2 provides Preston’s visual repre-
sentation of the means for the respondents’ rankings. 
If a high level of education is a primary characteristic of the hypothetical *SAE, then 
the opinions of these college students from Indiana would seem to provide relevant 
information about just where that language is spoken. Preston’s analysis indicates that 
these informants found the most correct English in ﬁve areas: North Central (including 
their own speech); Mid-Atlantic (excluding New York City); New England; Colorado; 
and the West Coast. Standard deviations indicated that the students are most consistent 
in their positive evaluation in the case of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, with their 
agreement decreasing as they move Eastward through Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, 
Delaware and ﬁnally Washington, DC (which showed little consistency in ranking with 
a standard deviation of 15.67). The worst standard deviation is for New York City. Preston 
hypothesizes this has to do with conﬂicting stereotypes about the city: from the center of 
culture to the center of crime. 
Most interesting perhaps is the incredibly high level of consistency in the way his 
subjects found a lack of correct English in the South. Mississippi ranked last in terms of

correct English and also was the most consistently ranked state. Preston takes the scores 
for the Southern states as “further proof of the salience of areas seen as nonstandard” 
(1989b: 56). 
From these various deﬁnitions, a picture begins to emerge. The hypothetical Standard 
is the language spoken and written by persons: 
with no regional accent; 
who reside in the Midwest, Far West or perhaps some parts of the Northeast (but 
never in the South); 
with more than average or superior education; 
who are themselves educators or broadcasters; 
who pay attention to speech, and are not sloppy in terms of pronunciation or grammar; 
who are easily understood by all; 
who enter into a consensus of other individuals like themselves about what is proper 
in language. 
It seems that we want language to be geographically neutral, because we believe that this 
neutrality will bring with it a greater range of communication. The assumption, of course, 
is that Midwest is neutral – at least, that is the way students in Indiana see it. Standard 
language ideology is responsible for the fact that a large percentage of students from other 
parts of the country agree with them. 
We want language to be structured and rule-governed and clear. Something as 
important as language cannot be left to itself: normal people are not smart enough, not 
aware enough, to be in charge of their own language. There must be experts, persons in 
charge, structured authority. In the minds of the respondents, the areas of the country in 
which the hypothetical Standard is not spoken (the South, New York City), are the logical 
home of accent. From this assumption it follows that everybody else speaks the hypo-

----- Page 86 (native) -----
THE STANDARD LANGUAGE MYTH 
61 
thetical Standard and thus, has no accent. A native of Mississippi or Brooklyn may have 
exactly the same educational background, intelligence, and point to make as their counter-
parts in Ohio and Colorado, but many believe that the accent must compromise the quality 
of the performance. 
This mindset is set down quite clearly in the Oxford English Dictionary (1989): 
[Accent is] The mode of utterance peculiar to an individual, locality, or nation, as “he 
has a slight accent, a strong provincial accent, an indisputably Irish, Scotch, American, 
French or German accent” . . . This utterance consists mainly in a prevailing quality 
of tone, or in a peculiar alteration of pitch, but may include mispronunciation of 
vowels or consonants, misplacing of stress, and misinflection of a sentence. The 
locality of a speaker is generally clearly marked by this kind of accent. 
The judgmental tone is quite evident even without the heavily significant choice of 
mispronunciation, misplacing, and misinﬂection. It follows from this deﬁnition that there is a 
correct regional pronunciation, but it is not explicitly identiﬁed. 
From a legal perspective, Matsuda notes the similarities between the construction of 
the hypothetical Standard, or English without an accent, on one hand, and hidden norms 
codiﬁed in our legal institutions, on the other: 
As feminist theorists have pointed out, everyone has a gender, but the hidden norm 
in law is male. As critical race theorists have pointed out, everyone has a race, but the 
hidden norm in law is white. In any dyadic relationship, the two ends are equidistant 
from each other. If the parties are equal in power, we see them as equally different 
from each other. When the parties are in a relationship of domination and sub-
ordination we tend to say that the dominant is normal, and the subordinate is different 
from normal. And so it is with accent . . . People in power are perceived as speaking 
normal, unaccented English. Any speech that is different from that constructed norm 
is called an accent. 
(Matsuda 1991: 805) 
The myth of standard language persists because it is carefully tended and propagated, with 
huge, almost universal success, so that language, the most fundamental of human social-
ization tools, becomes a commodity. This is the core of an ideology of standardization 
which empowers certain individuals and institutions to make these decisions and impose 
them on others. 
Words about words 
One very thorny problem that is not raised very often by sociolinguists is the fact that we 
are, as individuals and as a group, just as hampered by language ideology as the rest of the 
population (Bucholtz 2003; Eckert 2008; Gal 2005; Winford 2003; Wolfram 2007). This 
is best illustrated by the fact that most sociolinguists continue to use terms like standard 
and (worse still) non-standard even while they are arguing that these terms are ideological 
and inaccurate.4 Labov’s seminal paper “The Logic of Non-Standard English” (1972c), 
is a tour-de-force (and purposefully polemic) demonstration of the fact that the young 
men who speak AAVE are just as capable of constructing logical arguments (and sometimes

----- Page 87 (native) -----
62 
THE STANDARD LANGUAGE MYTH 
better at it) as young men who speak other varieties of English. In the forty years since it 
was ﬁrst published there have been hundreds of studies that reinforce Labov’s ﬁndings. 
The persistence of the terms standard and non-standard among linguists is a testament 
to the deep roots of language ideology. This is a problem with no easy solution. Coupland 
summarizes: 
“Standardness” and “non-standardness” are too deeply ingrained into sociolinguistic 
theory and methods for us to dispense with received perspectives and begin again, 
conceptually. Even so, there are good reasons to move on from ontological per-
spectives that reify, describe and account for Standard American English as a “natural” 
or “necessary” sociolinguistic reality. 
(2002: 632) 
In the first edition of this book I attempted to sidestep the use of standard and non-
standard by borrowing mainstream as a reference to the varieties of American English 
which were broadly considered to be correct by prescriptivists. In the years since then, I 
have come to the conclusion that mainstream is just as inaccurate as the term standard. 
Thus in this revised edition, I will use a term which, while not perfect, is an improvement 
on both standard/nonstandard and mainstream/peripheral. 
If you recall, syntacticians use an asterisk to mark utterances which are judged 
grammatically inauthentic. I am adapting that practice here, and will use *SAE to refer to 
that mythical beast, the idea of a homogenous, standard American English. 
There is also the issue of names and labels for language varieties, race and ethnicity. 
The Census Bureau’s terminology for race (Table 4.2) can be challenged on many levels, 
but it does observe the distinction between race and ethnicity. You’ll note that there 
are no terms in this list for someone whose family originated in a Spanish-speaking 
country. That is because Latinos (or Hispanics – more about this below) can be and are 
any race. 
In this volume my policy is to use those labels that people choose for themselves.5 In 
the case of Spanish-speaking Americans, the situation is far more complex in part because 
there are so many different cultures represented, a topic that will be discussed in Chapter 
14 in more detail. 
“White” as a category used by the Census Bureau is a descriptive term that does not 
parallel “African American” or “Asian.” European American is awkward and inexact; in 
Canada Anglophone has come to refer to their English-speaking (rather than French-
speaking) population. Historically Anglo has to do with the Anglo-Saxons in the British 
Isles, but the term has gained wider usage. Here I will use Anglo, Anglo-American, and 
sometimes, White.

For the African American language community I use African American Vernacular English 
(AAVE), African American English (AAE), or Black English. I will not use the term 
Ebonics except in quotations of work that is not my own, or in discussion of the term 
itself. Sclafani relates an anecdote which is an excellent illustration of the corruption of 
the term: 
I was once lectured by a retired airline pilot at a wedding reception on the difference 
between African American English and Ebonics; he held that the former was a 
“legitimate language” and the latter was “that horrible slang you hear on cable TV.” 
(Sclafani 2008: 508) 
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
The Free Online Dictionary’s (2009) deﬁnition of *SAE is interesting. How does the usage 
note relate to the deﬁnition? Is it complementary, or contradictory? 
Standard American English: The variety of English that is generally acknowledged 
as the model for the speech and writing of educated speakers. 
Usage note: People who invoke the term *SAE rarely make clear what they have 
in mind by it, and tend to slur over the inconvenient ambiguities that are inherent 
in the term. Sometimes it is used to denote the variety of English prescribed by 
traditional prescriptive norms, and in this sense it includes rules and usages that 
many educated speakers do not systematically conform to in their own speech 
or writing, such as the rules for use of who and whom. In recent years, however, 
the term has more often been used to distinguish the speech and writing of 
middle-class educated speakers from the speech of other groups and classes, 
which are termed nonstandard . . . Thus while the term can serve a useful 
descriptive purpose providing the context makes its meaning clear, it shouldn’t 
be construed as conferring any absolute positive evaluation. 
English Plus+ (Bair 2009; http://englishplus.com), a website that offers resources to 
prepare for the SAT, provides a deﬁnition of *SAE which covers every possibility: 
Standard American English, also known as Standard Written English or SWE, 
is the form of English most widely accepted as being clear and proper. 
Publishers, writers, educators, and others have over the years developed a 
consensus of what *SAE consists of. It includes word choice, word order, 
punctuation, and spelling. 
Standard American English is especially helpful when writing because it maintains 
a fairly uniform standard of communication which can be understood by all 
speakers and users of English regardless of differences in dialect, pronunciation, 
and usage. This is why it is sometimes called Standard Written English. 
There are a few minor differences between standard usage in England and the 
United States, but these differences do not signiﬁcantly affect communication 
in the English language.

THE STANDARD LANGUAGE MYTH 
Please note that most dictionaries merely report on words that are used, not on 
their grammar or usage. Merely because a word appears in a dictionary does 
not mean that it is standard. 
How does this deﬁnition compare to the others quoted in this chapter? How is it different? 
Consider the last paragraph especially, which strikes a very different tone. The author 
seems to be challenging the authority of dictionaries. Why might that be? 
Consider these two statements: 
The fact that a word appears in a dictionary means ____. 
The fact that a word does not appear in a dictionary means _____. 
Can you come up with clear, consistent and factually accurate ways to finish these 
thoughts? If not, why not? 
In this book I use *SAE to refer to the concept of a standardized, idealized American 
English. How does this term ﬁt, or fail to ﬁt? Can you come up with a better solution? 
Notes 
1  Sociolinguists are still debating the parameters of such crucial terms as prestige, 
education, and standard: “Other[s] might share my sense of institutional frustration 
at how far sociolinguistics is from being able to present a consistent and persuasive set 
of principles and perspectives on [*SAE]” (Coupland 2000: 623). See also Milroy 
(2004a) for a discussion of the importance of resolving these very basic matters. 
2  The equivalent variety of British English will be referenced as *SBE. 
3  These deﬁnitions were answers to queries posted to various CompuServe discussion 
forums in summer 1995 requesting personal deﬁnitions of *SAE. Answers came from 
adults in all parts of the country who provided answers with the knowledge that they 
would be used here in whole or part.

A parallel challenge has to do with how we think about and deﬁne race. In sociology, 
race is not seen as a matter of genetics or biology. Race is not a thing at all, but a very 
complex process, the application of a set of stereotypes through institutions (Omi and 
Winant 1994). That is, race is a social construct, an idea that is imposed by the same 
institutions that promote language ideology. 
In a series of studies Baugh has approached this issue from various directions (1991, 
2005, 2006a) in which he carefully teases apart the question of racial identity to the 
point that terms like “African American” mean very little. “It Ain’t About Race: Some 
Lingering (Linguistic) Consequences of the African Slave Trade and Their Relevance 
to Your Personal Historical Hardship Index” (2006a) is an examination of the greater 
sociopolitical, historical and linguistic context of race in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Katrina. 
5  For example, when writing about American Indians or Native Americans, I make an 
attempt to identify the tribe. This raises the question: Do the Hopi have a different 
variety and accent of English than the Navaho or the Chippewa?

The primary function of myth is to validate an existing social order. Myth enshrines 
conservative social values, raising tradition on a pedestal. It expresses and conﬁrms, 
rather than explains or questions, the sources of cultural attitudes and values . . . 
Because myth anchors the present in the past it is a sociological charter for a future 
society which is an exact replica of the present one. 
Ann Oakley (1974) 
When I read some of the rules for speaking and writing the English language 
correctly, I think any fool can make a rule, and every fool will mind it. 
Henry David Thoreau, Journal entry, February 3, 1860 
Close to ﬁfty years of empirical work in sociolinguistics have established that language is 
ﬂexible and constantly ﬂexing, and that emblematic marking of social allegiances is not 
random. We use variation in language to construct ourselves as social beings, to signal 
who we are, and who we are not and do not want to be. Speakers choose among socio-
linguistic variants available; their choices group together in ways which are obvious and 
interpretable to other speakers in the community. This process is a functional and 
necessary part of the way we interact. It is not an optional feature of the spoken language. 
When an individual is asked to reject their own language, we are asking them to drop 
allegiances to the people and places that deﬁne them. We do not, cannot under our laws, 
ask a person to change the color of her skin, her religion, her gender, her sexual identity, 
but we regularly demand of people that they suppress or deny the most effective way they 
have of situating themselves socially in the world: 
I don’t care about the color of our skin, but speak that dialect of yours someplace where 
it won’t insult my ears. 
You were a successful engineer in the Ukraine, sure, but why can’t you speak real 
English? 
If you just didn’t sound so corn-pone, people would take you seriously. 
You’re the best salesperson we’ve got, but must you sound gay on the phone? 
It is hard for most younger people to imagine a time when Congress and the courts did 
nothing to prevent violence against people of color while the media looked the other way. 
It is even more difficult to acknowledge how slowly things began to improve after the 
Emancipation Proclamation. It’s true that progress was made; Harry Truman achieved 
some signiﬁcant advances by establishing a committee on civil rights, and then charging 
the committee to design policies that would eliminate discrimination and segregation in 
employment, the civil service, the armed forces, housing, access to health care, public 
accommodations, voting, and interstate transportation.1

----- Page 92 (native) -----
LANGUAGE SUBORDINATION 
67 
But it’s also true that anti-lynching legislation came before the Senate some two hundred 
times after the Emancipation Proclamation and before the passage of the Civil Rights Act, 
and two hundred times the Senate did not vote, even once, on that legislation; senators 
from the South went to extraordinary lengths to block such bills by keeping them in 
committee. The House did pass the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill in 1922; this made it possible 
for such cases to be tried in federal courts rather than state and local courts, which were 
biased in favor of the person or persons charged with inﬂicting bodily harm. In 2005, the 
Senate apologized officially for the lack of action on their part, but yet, in 2005, ten 
senators voted against that resolution (Anon 2005). 
All the evidence indicates that there is still blatant discrimination in employment, 
housing, education, the media, the courts and in everyday interaction. Despite the passing 
of Civil Rights legislation, despite what we would like to think of as a more enlightened 
attitude about social issues, discrimination persists. Civil Rights legislation has brought 
about some positive change, but it has also driven those who wish to discriminate under-
ground, where alternate, more subtle approaches to exclusion have been crafted. 
In the wake of ever tighter antidiscrimination laws, language and accent have become 
an acceptable excuse to publicly turn away, to refuse to recognize the other or acknowledge 
their rights. Recognition and misrecognition are concepts that have interested philosophers 
for a long time. Ricoeur (2005) notes that human beings have a common constitution, and 
that our commonalities demand mutual recognition, something that we resist. Everyone 
struggles “against the misrecognition of others at the same time that it is a struggle for 
recognition of oneself by others” (ibid.: 258). 
Taylor describes the opposite of recognition as misrecognition: 
[O]ur identity is partly shaped by recognition or its absence, often by the misrecog-
nition of others, and so a person or group of people can suffer real damage, real 
distortion, if the people or society around them mirror back to them a conﬁning or 
demeaning or contemptible picture of themselves. 
(1994: 25) 
If you look closely at language-focused discrimination, you will ﬁnd that it is not language 
per se that is relevant; instead we need to understand the individual’s beliefs about lan-
guage and following from those beliefs, institutional practices. In short, these beliefs 
and practices are the way in which individuals and groups are denied recognition. In this 
study I use ideology as a framework to examine and understand the subordination process. 
That is, I am interesting in exploring how arguments for standardization reproduce 
“cultural conceptions which are partial, contestable and contested, and interest-laden” 
(Woolard and Schieffelin 1994: 58; see also Schieffelin et al. 1998; Silverstein 1998; 
Woolard 2008). 
For our purposes, ideology is deﬁned as: “the promotion of the needs and interests of 
a dominant group or class at the expense of marginalized groups, by means of disinfor-
mation and misrepresentation of those non-dominant groups.” 
More speciﬁcally, standard language ideology (SLI) is deﬁned as: 
a bias toward an abstracted, idealized, homogenous spoken language which is imposed 
and maintained by dominant bloc institutions and which names as its model the 
written language, but which is drawn primarily from the spoken language of the upper 
middle class.2

LANGUAGE SUBORDINATION 
Silverstein’s work on language ideology (1979, 1998) initiated a long discussion of how 
ideology functions, while Foucault considered the way in which discourse is “controlled, 
selected, organized and redistributed,” or disciplined. In concluding that “discourse is the 
power to be seized” (1984), Foucault was anticipating some of the arguments about 
rhetorical framing which will be raised in later chapters. 
SLI proposes that an idealized nation-state has one perfect, homogenous language. That 
hypothetical, idealized language is the means by which (1) discourse is seized, and (2) 
rationalizations for that seizure are constructed. It is also a fragile construct and one that 
needs to be protected. 
It might be argued that in a culture such as ours which obliges everyone to participate 
in the educational system, everyone has access to discourse. In theory, marginalized groups 
can, by coming through the educational system, make themselves heard. Foucault antici-
pates part of this argument by pointing out the fallacy of the assumption of education as 
an evenly distributed and power-neutral cultural resource: “Any system of education is a 
political way of maintaining or modifying the appropriation of discourses, along with the 
knowledges and powers which they carry” (ibid.: 123). 
The educational system may not be the beginning, but it is the heart of the standard-
ization process. To suggest that children who do not speak *SAE will ﬁnd acceptance and 
validation in the schools is, in a word, ludicrous. A child who tells her stories in stigmatized 
varieties of English is quickly corrected. She must assimilate, or fall silent. Sledd sees this 
as an institutionalized policy to formally initiate children into the linguistic prejudices (and 
hence, language ideology) of the middle classes (Sledd 1972, 1988). Dominant institutions 
promote the notion of an overarching, homogenous standard language which is primarily 
Anglo, upper middle-class, and ethnically middle-American. Whether the issues at hand 
are large-scale sociopolitical in nature or more subtle, whether the approach is coercion 
or consent, there are two sides to this process: ﬁrst, devaluation of all that is not (or does 
not seek to be) politically, culturally or socially marked as belonging to the privileged class, 
and second, validation of the social (and linguistic) values of the dominant institutions. 
The process of linguistic assimilation to an abstracted standard is cast as a natural one, 
necessary and positive for the greater social good. 
What we do not seem to understand clearly, what is mysterious and important, is not 
so much the way in which the powerful deny others acknowledgement and permission 
to be heard in their own voices, but more so how and why those groups cooperate. How 
do the dominant bloc institutions manage to convince whole groups of human beings 
that they do not fully or adequately possess an appropriate human language? And, more 
mysteriously, why do those groups hand over this authority? 
Eagleton puts a more personal face on this question when he summarizes one way 
ideology works with the simple but striking observation that critical language theory tries 
to understand “how people come to invest in their own unhappiness” (Eagleton 2007: emphasis 
added).3 
When speakers of devalued or stigmatized varieties of English consent to the standard 
language ideology, they become complicit in its propagation against themselves, their own 
interests and identities. Many are caught in a vacuum: If an individual cannot ﬁnd any 
social acceptance for her language outside her own speech communities, she may come 
to denigrate her own language, even while she continues to use it. 
A standard language ideology provides a web of (supposedly) common-sense arguments, 
in which the vernacular speaker can get tangled at every turn: at school, in radio news, at 
the movies, while reading novels, at work, she hears that the language which marks her as

Chilean, Muslim, or a native of Mississippi is ugly, unacceptable, incoherent, illogical. 
This is countered, daily, by her experience: she does communicate, effectively, with the 
people who are closest and most important to her, who mark their language similarly. She 
even manages to communicate with the people who are criticizing her, in spite of their 
complaints. The things they say about her language and her social allegiances make her 
uncomfortable and unhappy. The things they promise her if she were to change this 
behavior may be very seductive: more money, success, recognition. She may think about 
trying to change the way she talks, and pay some attention to pronunciation points which 
have been brought to her attention. It isn’t clear to her that her phonology – her accent 
– will be very difﬁcult to change. 
This day-by-day, persistent devaluation of her social self has repercussions. It might 
eventually bring her to the point of resistance, on a personal level. If there is a group of 
people like her going through the same experience, it might bring organized resistance. 
There are occasional signs of this: An accent reduction class scheduled in a South Carolina 
school which must close because of lack of student interest (Riddle 1993); a movement to 
validate Hawai’ian Creole in public forums (Verploegen 1988); a group in Wisconsin 
which publicizes their commitment to AAVE and their wish to have it recognized for the 
functional language it is (Hamblin 1995); a Cambodian-American who takes his employer 
to court for telling him that to get a promotion he must “sound American” (Xieng 1991; 
Court case Xieng 1993: 93, see Appendix). 
In the rest of this book we will see that the institutions that embody language ideology 
do not let these small acts of resistance go by unnoticed; they strike back, and strike hard. 
The institutions which see themselves as protectors of the values of the nation-state work 
hard to validate their favored status in that state, in part on the basis of language. This 
process of resistance and counter-resistance which pits the empowered against small 
groups or individuals who struggle for recognition is an on-going process. It is reminiscent 
of Antonio Gramsci’s recasting of Marxist social theory in terms of what he called 
hegemony, or ideology as struggle.4 
What concerns us in the remainder of this book is the process of linguistic domination 
itself. The arguments which are used to legitimize the values of the mainstream and to 
devalue non-conforming language varieties are well established, and so accepted that they 
are often quite openly used. 
Before we look at speciﬁc instances of the process of misrecognition, it will be useful 
to focus attention on two analytical tools. The first is a working model of the way 
institutions subordinate linguistically. The second is a brief consideration of the way this 
language subordination model is realized in the uneven distribution of what will be called 
the communicative burden. 
A model of the language subordination process 
The steps in the language subordination process included in this model (Figure 5.1) have 
been compiled from an analysis of a wide range of reactions or actions of dominant bloc 
institutions when a threat to the authority of the homogenous language of the nation-state 
has been perceived. The elements in this model grew out of analysis of many kinds of 
public commentary on language use and language communities, but they are similar to 
other models of ideological processes.5

LANGUAGE SUBORDINATION 
Language is mystiﬁed. 
You can never hope to comprehend the difﬁculties and complexities of your mother 
tongue without expert guidance. 
Authority is claimed. 
We are the experts. Talk like me/us. We know what we are doing because we have 
studied language, because we write well. 
Misinformation is generated. 
That usage you are so attached to is inaccurate. The variant I prefer is superior on 
historical, aesthetic, or logical grounds. 
Targeted languages are trivialized. 
Look how cute, how homey, how funny. 
Conformers are held up as positive examples. 
See what you can accomplish if you only try, how far you can get if you see the light. 
Non-conformers are viliﬁed or marginalized. 
See how willfully stupid, arrogant, unknowing, uninformed and/or deviant these 
speakers are. 
Explicit promises are made. 
Employers will take you seriously; doors will open. 
Threats are made. 
No one important will take you seriously; doors will close. 
Figure 5.1 The language subordination model 
Mystiﬁcation is a basic tool in the application of any ideology but the fact is that people 
do communicate with each other in the vernacular, and they do so daily, without special-
ized knowledge of language. The claim that spoken language is so complex that mere 
native speakers can never sort things out for themselves is countered by evidence, but the 
mystiﬁcation message is so strong that many people really believe they don’t speak their 
own language well. 
A particularly striking case of self-denigration comes out of England, where John 
Prescott, a prominent politician, was a constant object of mockery in the print media not 
so much for his policies, but for his English (Wooding 2008). It’s certainly nothing unusual 
for newspapers to target an individual for grievances, real or imaginary. What was unusual 
in this case was the target’s complicit agreement: 
Mr. Prescott said: 
It’s something I’ve not mastered – the language or the grammar – and that’s caused 
a problem for me. It goes back to the education. Secondary modern school education 
wasn’t the greatest, but there were lots of people who learned the grammar – I didn’t. 
It’s often used as part of my characterization – mangle the language. 
Since the popularization of the internet, examples of trivialization abound. Later we’ll 
be looking at two examples: the explosion of websites mocking Ebonics after the 1997 
controversy (Ronkin and Karn 1999), and similar tactics undertaken to peripheralize and 
trivialize Spanish speakers (Hill 1995, 2008).

Any speaker of a stigmatized vernacular is promised large returns if he or she will adopt 
*SAE. Persons who persist in their allegiance to stigmatized varieties of English will be 
cut off from the everyday privileges and rights of citizenship at every turn, regardless of 
inherent talent or intelligence. 
At its most brutal, this turns into personal attacks on whole groups of people. The most 
salient example of this will be seen in the way *SAE speakers and adherents react to any 
attempt to cast a stigmatized variety in a positive or legitimate light. Dominant bloc 
institutions lead the charge in cases like these, and the results are loud and shrill. The best 
recent example of this happening on a large-scale basis is what is generally called the 
Oakland Ebonics controversy, something we will look at in more detail in Chapter 16. 
In this model linguistic form and social structures are connected by means of ideology 
(here used simply in the sense of “what people believe”), an approach that originated in 
its current form with Silverstein (1979), as well as in the work of other anthropological 
linguists and sociolinguists. In fact, all three of these nodes are bound, each to the other 
(Figure 5.2). Ideology cannot be abstracted away; no one can suspend the way they think 
about language from the process of interpreting language. 
Before moving on, it will be useful to consider the nature of communication as a 
collaborative act between two or more persons. 
Rejecting the gift: the individual’s role in the communicative process 
The most common rationalizations for discrimination against non-*SAE accents and 
languages have to do with communication. “I’ve got nothing against [Taiwanese, 
Appalachians, Kenyans],” the argument will go. It is not hard to ﬁnd people who won’t 
hesitate to put these opinions into words in a public forum: 
I cannot stand anyone with a thick Black Southern accent, it sounds racist but I seriously 
cannot understand when the people try to communicate to me. Example: I called my 
cell company and I needed help with why my email pop system did not work. The guy 
had a half Ebonics/Southern slang accent. Trying to explain to me technical shit I had 
to do. It was super annoying. I had to have him keep repeating to me what the hell he 
was saying, it was embarrassing me [sic] for me, and probably for him or not. 
(Electrical Audio, November 30, 2008) 
Communication seems to be a simple thing: one person talks and another listens; they 
change roles. But the social space between two speakers is rarely completely neutral. Think 
Figure 5.2 Ideology as the bridge or ﬁlter between language change and social structures

of the people you talked to today. Each time you begin an exchange, a complex series of 
calculations begins: Do I need to be formal with this person? Do I owe her respect? Does 
she owe me deference? Will she take me seriously, or reject me out of hand? What do I 
want from her, or she from me? Those calculations are more conscious in unusual 
encounters; for example, if you suddenly were introduced to the Queen of England, 
without preparation, would you be comfortable talking to her? For those you interact with 
every day, the calculations are fast and sure and well below the level of consciousness. 
In any situation, a person can simply refuse to communicate. In an adversarial position, 
we may understand perfectly what our partners, parents, friends say to us, but still respond 
with “I cannot understand you.” We can also reject how what we say has been understood: 
We say “You just don’t understand” when in fact the issue is not comprehension, but 
difference of opinion. 
When a person rejects the message in this way, he or she is refusing to accept respon-
sibility in the communicative act, and the full burden is put directly on the other. “I can’t 
understand you” may mean, in reality: “You can’t make me understand you.” 
Clark’s cognitive model of the communicative act is based on a principle of mutual 
responsibility, in which participants in a conversation collaborate in the establishment of 
new information. This involves complicated processes of repair, expansion, and replace-
ment in iterative fashion until both parties are satisﬁed: 
Many purposes in conversation, however, change moment by moment as the two 
people tolerate more or less uncertainty about the listener’s understanding of the 
speaker’s references. The heavier burden usually falls on the listener, since she is in 
the best position to assess her own comprehension. 
(Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986: 34) 
When native speakers of U.S. English are confronted with an accent which is foreign to 
them – either unfamiliar varieties of English, or foreign (L2) accented English – the ﬁrst 
decision they make is whether or not they are going to participate. What we will see again 
and again in the examples that follow, is that members of the dominant language group 
(in the cases we will examine, those who classify themselves as *SAE speakers) feel perfectly 
empowered to reject their responsibility, and to demand that a person with an accent carry 
the majority of the burden in the communicative act. Conversely, when an *SAE speaker 
comes in contact with another *SAE speaker who is nonetheless incoherent or unclear, 
the ﬁrst response is not to reject the communicative burden, but to take other factors into 
consideration and work harder at establishing understanding. 
The whole concept of units of conversation in which two partners work toward mutual 
comprehension assumes a certain state of mind on the part of the participants, and to an 
extent, the question of skill. Intercultural competence is as crucial to successful communi-
cation as underlying motivation, solidarity or hostility. Work in accommodation theory 
(Gallois et al. 2004; Giles 1984; Giles et al. 1991) suggests that a complex interplay of 
linguistic and psychological factors will establish the predisposition to understand or to 
refuse to understand. 
Thakerar, Giles and Cheshire (1982) conducted a series of empirical tests to examine 
accommodation behavior; they were not working directly with L2 accented speech, but 
their findings are generally typical of such studies, which verify something known 
intuitively: listeners and speakers will work harder to ﬁnd a communicative middle ground 
and foster mutual intelligibility when they are motivated, socially and psychologically, to

----- Page 98 (native) -----

73 
do so. Conversely, when the speaker perceives that the act of accommodating or assimilat-
ing linguistically may bring more disadvantages than advantages, in in-group terms, he or 
she may diverge even farther from the language of the listener. 
Degree of accentedness, whether from interference of a native language other than 
English, or a socially or geographically marked language variety, cannot predict the level 
of an individual’s competency in the target language or skill as a communicator. In fact, 
high degrees of competence are often attained by persons with especially strong foreign 
language accents. Nevertheless, accent will sometimes be an issue in communication, 
especially in the case of non-native speakers of English who are in the early stages of 
learning the language 
Accent, in the general way it has been used here, can sometimes be an impediment to 
communication even when all parties involved in the communicative act are willing, even 
eager, to understand. In many cases, however, breakdown of communication is due not 
so much to accent as it is to negative social evaluation of the accent in question, and a 
rejection of the communicative burden. 
When we are confronted with a new person we want to or must talk to, we make a quick 
series of social evaluations based on many external cues, one of them being the person’s 
language and accent. On the phone, of course, the only cues we get are linguistic in nature. 
Based on our personal histories, our own backgrounds and social selves which together 
comprise a set of filters through which we hear the people we talk to, we will take a 
communicative stance. Most of the time, we will agree to carry our share of the burden 
(Figure 5.3). Sometimes, if we are especially positive about the configuration of social 
characteristics we see in the person, or if the purposes of communication are especially 
important to us, we will accept a disproportionate amount of the burden. 
Each of us would group the accents we come across in different conﬁgurations. For the 
majority of Americans, French accents are positive ones, but not for all of us. Many have 
strong pejorative reactions to Asian accents, or to African American Vernacular English, 
but certainly not everyone does. The accents we hear must go through our language 
ideology ﬁlters. In extreme cases, we feel completely justiﬁed in rejecting the communi-
cative burden, and the person in front of us:6 
The supervisor explained that workers would . . . ask the plaintiff what he wanted them 
to do, and then simply walk away, unable to understand. The supervisor refused to 
attribute such incidents to the plaintiff’s accent, but offered no other explanation. He 
said they just couldn’t understand him “like normal people with normal language.” 
I signed up for this chemistry course but dropped it when I saw the Teaching Assistant. 
I shouldn’t have to have TAs who can’t speak English natively. 
She put on a really excellent presentation to the committee, but if she had applied for 
a job on the phones sounding like she does, we wouldn’t have hired her. 
What we have yet to fully understand is how the subjugation process works, why it works, 
and why we let it. We will see that standard language ideology is introduced by the schools, 
vigorously promoted by the media and entertainment industries and further institutional-
ized by the corporate sector. It is enforced in subtle and not so subtle ways by the judicial 
system. Thus, it is not surprising that many individuals do not recognize the fact that for 
spoken language, variation is systematic, structured, and inherent, and that *SAE is an 
abstraction. What is surprising, even deeply disturbing, is the way that many individuals 
who consider themselves democratic, even-handed, rational and free of prejudice, hold

Figure 5.3 Accepting or rejecting the communicative burden 
on tenaciously to a standard ideology which attempts to justify rejection of the other 
because of race, ethnicity, or other facet of identity that would otherwise be called racism. 
Accent discrimination can be found everywhere in our daily lives. In fact, such behavior 
is so commonly accepted, so widely perceived as appropriate, that it must be seen as the 
last back door to discrimination. And the door stands wide open.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
From Nunberg (2009 1983/1997) consider this paragraph from “The Decline of 
Grammar”: 
If we are bent on ﬁnding a decline in standards, the place to look is not in the 
language itself but in the way it is talked about. In the profusion of new books 
and articles on the state of the language, and in most new usage books, the 
moral note, if it is sounded at all, is either wavering or shrill. What is largely 
missing is the idea that there is any pleasure or instruction to be derived from 
considering what makes good usage good. Rather, grammar comes increasingly 
to be regarded as a mandarin code that requires only ritual justiﬁcation. And, for 
all the heated polemics over the importance of grammar, it appears that each 
party at least implicitly accepts this view. 
What is it that Nunberg wants? Is he appealing to linguists, prescriptivists or both? On 
what basis? The entire piece is available online, for a deeper understanding of his position. 
How might Accommodation Theory serve as a tool to analyze disagreement more 
generally? Can you reconstruct an argument you’ve had (or can imagine having) using 
the idea of the communicative burden? 
Do you remember an occasion when you witnessed or overheard one person refusing 
to understand another, though the communicative content was clear? Why was the 
communicative burden rejected? 
Discuss how standard language ideology has been a positive or negative force in your 
own life or your family’s. Has it afforded you advantages, or disadvantages? How have 
you used language ideology yourself? 
Consider the contribution from Electrical Audio to an online discussion of accents that 
are attractive or displeasing on p. 71. How is (or isn’t) this an example of language 
ideology at work? If not language ideology, what is going on here? 
Read “Help for today’s Eliza Doolittles,” a newspaper article that appeared in the Christian 
Science Monitor (Gardner 1999). How does this article demonstrate the language 
subordination process? What steps are used? Why is the tone relevant? 
Consider two (unlikely, but useful) scenarios: 
Walking along the street in London, you come around a corner face to face with Mick 
Jagger. He’s wearing a torn concert t-shirt and ripped jeans, and he grabs you by 
the arm. His breath is bad, and he’s slurring his words. He is looking for his runaway 
terrier and he’s talking very fast. You don’t understand everything he says in his high 
agitation, but it’s clear he wants your help. 
You’re waiting for a bus in a small crowd of people when a shabbily dressed stranger 
who looks a lot like Mick Jagger approaches you, slowly and with deference. In a 
very heavily accented English (maybe it’s Polish, you think, or some other Eastern 
European language) this person asks for directions. 
Are you equally willing to help in both situations? Do you in fact help both these people? 
If not, how do you handle it?

Notes 
1  The committee issued their report, To Secure These Rights, in October 1947. During 
this same period, The United Nations began to put together the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights , which establishes that all people are entitled to basic human rights 
without regard for race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status. In his study The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights: Origins, Drafting, and Intent, Morsink (2000) provides 
insight into the discussions that went on behind the scenes while the declaration was 
being drafted. 
2  The term standard language ideology was coined by James and Lesley Milroy. Their 
work in this area was the first impetus for much of my own thinking on this issue, 
which has been further inﬂuenced in particular by the work of Fairclough, Silverstein, 
Eagleton, Bakhtin, Bourdieu and Foucault as well as by linguists Eckert, Bucholtz, 
Schieffelin, Woolard, et al. The definition I provide here has evolved from those 
provided in earlier publications. 
3  A classical Marxist might look at the way language ideology works and find it an 
excellent example of “false consciousness,” or the process by which the working class 
is manipulated into accepting a status quo which denies their own claims while 
preserving the interests of those with property and power, because it is right and good 
and common sense to do so. But the Marxist ideological model has limitations; its 
unidirectionality does not resemble the give-and-take process of standardization well 
enough to make it useful in this discussion. 
4  The more common use of hegemony is in the sense of dominance or domination, but 
here I use the Gramscian deﬁnition. Gramsci provides an interesting example of an 
attempt to bend linguistic facts to a particular end. In his writings he argues strongly 
for teaching the lower and working classes a standardized Italian, and equates this 
process with passing on literacy, a necessary tool to fight oppression. Gramsci’s 
confusion of symptom with cause (he sees friction following from the fact of language 
heterogeneity) and his rejection of rural values would seem to be at odds with his goals 
more generally. He was apparently able to deal with language as if it were a commodity 
to be willfully manipulated and cleansed of regional and social variation on command. 
This is particularly strange as he very early recognized the relationship between the 
rise of public discourse around language and accelerated shifting in the established 
power structures and hegemony (ibid.).

War and elsewhere.

The educational system

Fixing the message in stone 
The situation of our youth is not mysterious. Children have never been very good at 
listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them. 
James Baldwin, “Nobody Knows My Name” (1985b: 208) 
Education is commonly understood to be the key to success of all kinds, and formal 
education is built on the cornerstone of literacy. School is ﬁrst and foremost the place 
where children learn to read and write. 
The majority of children in the United States are educated in state-run and ﬁnanced 
schools, where attendance is mandatory and the curriculum goes well beyond reading and 
writing. We hold schools responsible for turning the children in their care into a 
productive body of citizens capable of critical thought. The goal is an informed electorate, 
one which will accept and perpetuate the values of the nation-state. 
The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) explicitly links goals in literacy 
to those of citizenship: “Standards [in language arts education] can help us ensure that all 
students become informed citizens and participate fully in society” (National Council of 
Teachers of English 1996).1 Thus the primary educational goal in our schools equates the 
acquisition of literacy with the adoption of both a spoken and written *SAE. 
Teaching is a difficult profession, a particularly challenging way to make a living, 
undertaken by people who are for the most part deeply dedicated and truly wish to do well 
for the children in their charge. A teacher is both an authority ﬁgure and a role model and 
as such has tremendous influence in a child’s life. What follows in this chapter is an 
examination of the beliefs and practices of educators in so far as they address language 
issues, and how language ideology affects goals in both abstract and concrete ways. This 
is not a frontal attack on the crucial but undervalued profession of teaching, but a 
consideration of how inequality and disadvantage are perpetuated – for the most part 
unwittingly – in the classroom. 
There is a large body of work on the way teachers’ attitudes play out in the classroom, 
and it is remarkably consistent in its ﬁndings. For example, Briggs and Pailliotet (1997) 
undertook a study of education majors who had had extensive coursework emphasizing 
process-based (rather than error-based) evaluation of student work. In this study, the 
education majors were asked to correct a number of essays but despite their training, the 
subjects were highly consistent in attributing usage errors with student carelessness, 
laziness, and incompetence. These findings supplemented Briggs and Pailliotet’s own 
observations on the power of language conventions, and provided some insight into “how 
grammatical instruction remains a locus of power and control in English instruction at 
any level” (ibid.: 1).2 There is a crucial question without any clear answer: Most teachers 
are aware of the power and control they have, but how many of them realize how very

influential their personal opinions are in student success?3 Ideology is indeed most 
powerful when it is least visible; the invisibility of ideology also makes it much easier to 
propagate in a classroom. 
Language ideology in education is a multi-faceted and complex subject that cannot be 
addressed by means of a handful of academic studies; instead, I focus here on two speciﬁc 
angles: ﬁrst, children who speak stigmatized varieties of English (Appalachian English, 
British West Indian English, Sea Islands Creole, Gullah, Mexicano English, Hawai’i 
Creole English, among many others) and how they cope, or fail to cope. Second, I’ll look 
brieﬂy at the language spoken by the teachers themselves. When a teacher who grew up 
speaking a stigmatized vernacular is assigned to teach a first grade class in his old 
neighborhood, what does institutional policy tell him about the kind of English he should 
use with those children? Do teachers in this position follow prescripted usage rules, or do 
they simply use whichever language works best in reaching the children? How do they 
talk to children about their language? What advantages and disadvantages might there be 
to this? This second issue will be taken up again in Chapter 9, which deals with cases where 
teachers have sued their schools and school districts for language-focused discrimination 
under Title XII of the Civil Rights Act. 
The setting of goals 
Figure 6.1 provides some insight into one of the most difﬁcult and intractable problems 
in public education: there are large populations of children who do not learn to read.4 This 
is not a new problem, but it is one that has evaded solutions. While educators, social 
scientists, government agencies, psychiatrists and linguists spend a lot of time trying to 
ﬁgure out (1) what’s going wrong, and (2) how to ﬁx it, whole generations of children leave 
school unprepared and perhaps even worse, uninspired. Certainly language conﬂicts are 
relevant, but whether they are a part of the cause or simply a symptom, that is yet to be

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
fully determined. When the subject comes into the public consciousness, it is almost always 
in connection with issues of race and ethnicity, bilingualism and stigmatized varieties of 
English. Despite strong evidence that poverty is at the root of many of the problems, the 
subject is rarely raised (but see especially Baugh 1999: 115 ff.). 
Educators are aware of larger language-related issues as well. In 1972, the executive 
committee of the Conference on College Composition and Communication5 passed a 
statement which was ratiﬁed by the membership in 1974: 
We afﬁrm the students’ right to their own patterns and varieties of language – the 
dialects of their nurture or whatever dialects in which they ﬁnd their own identity 
and style. Language scholars long ago denied that the myth of a standard American 
dialect has any validity. The claim that any one dialect is unacceptable amounts to an 
attempt of one social group to exert its dominance over another. Such a claim leads 
to false advice for speakers and writers, and immoral advice for humans. A nation 
proud of its diverse heritage and its cultural and racial variety will preserve its heritage 
of dialects. We afﬁrm strongly that teachers must have the experiences and training 
that will enable them to respect diversity and uphold the right of students to their 
own language. 
Despite these clearly deﬁned and articulated goals and a great many dedicated professionals 
who believe in the stated principles, more than 30 years have not seen much progress 
in terms of large-scale policies.6 Nevertheless, the discussion continues and individuals 
have been working on ways to incorporate these goals into their research and teaching 
methodologies (Bruch and Marback 2005; Kinloch 2005; Katz et al. 2009; Scott and 
National Council of Teachers of English 2009). Kinloch (2005) has taken an integrative 
approach, encouraging her colleagues 
[to] reimagine our educational commitments, our shared values, in ways that mobilize 
public and professional attitudes circulating around the education of monolingual and 
multilingual students. This mobilization, I believe, needs to be grounded in linguistic 
and cultural negotiation and not in a wrong language/right language debate. 
(2005: 94) 
Consider that every child comes to school with a home language (sometimes, more than 
one). They arrive fully fluent in that language. The child must now learn a series of 
concrete and abstract skills – reading and writing as well as an understanding of how and 
when different varieties are used to greatest effectiveness.7 But it is at this point that trouble 
arises. The solid and reasonable arguments for literacy are now attached to the spoken 
language without discussion or pause. If Student A can learn to read and write, this mindset 
seems to go, then Student A can also learn to speak a different language variety. The two 
goals (mastering the standardized written language, and replacing one spoken language 
with another) have different underlying motivations, and in fact they stand in opposition 
to each other. What may seem minor in the ﬁrst grade (reminding students to use a certain 
verb form) can mushroom into broad exclusionary practices that go beyond issues of 
spelling to the silencing of discourse, to the detriment of everybody (Gee 2007a [1996]: 
221). This is an issue that is always close to the surface in the African American commu-
nity, in part because of what Baugh has called educational malpractice stemming from 
educational apartheid (1999: 4). According to June Jordan (1989): “Black children in

America must acquire competence in white English, for the sake of self-preservation. But 
you will never teach a child a new language by scorning and ridiculing and forcibly erasing 
his ﬁrst language.” 
Appropriacy arguments 
The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), together with the International 
Reading Association (IRA) regularly reviews, revises and publishes Standards for the 
English Language Arts, a 12-point list which emphasizes reading and reading com-
prehension skills. The spoken language is mentioned only three times. A survey of 
language arts textbooks provides a similar picture, in which the focus is primarily the 
written language. In this view of education, children are potentially productive members 
of literacy communities rather than language communities (National Council of Teachers 
of English 1996: 3). 
One variety of English can be targeted for culling with a ready-made but shallow set of 
appropriacy rationalizations. 
Tightly bound to the concept of linguistic appropriacy is that of communicative 
competence, a term ﬁrst coined by anthropological linguists, but appropriated by educa-
tional theorists. Taken in its loosest form, to become communicatively competent, a child 
learns how to adapt speech and writing on the basis of context, audience, and intention. 
Add to this the subjective nature of social appropriacy which is rarely challenged and the 
stage is set. If communicative competence is taken as a speaker’s ability to use language 
appropriately in social context, and we do not challenge the construction of “appropriacy,” 
then we have opened a back door to exclusion on the basis of another kind of “correctness” 
logic.8 
Appropriacy judgments that cloak subjective, culturally bound judgments of “correct-
ness” might be made clearer by the contrast between two statements: 
1 
It is inappropriate for a law student to pose a question in Hawai’ian Creole English in 
the classroom. 
2 
It is inappropriate for a wife to contradict her husband. 
While the second statement was once unremarkable, it would now evoke resounding 
criticism in most quarters. The ﬁrst statement might still pass without comment, although 
the underlying issue; silencing of voices considered unworthy or unequal, is the same.9 To 
challenge the ﬁrst statement in the U.S. educational system is to question the primacy of 
one language variety over all others.10 
At the same time, it is important to remember that ideologies and social strategies for 
the limitation of one language over another are not limited to one segment of the 
population. The following statements indicate that the concept of appropriacy has a wider, 
and quite relevant place in the discussion of the distribution of language varieties over 
social space: 
1 
A child who is a native speaker of Hawai’i Creole English may be criticized for using 
her home language rather than *SAE in the classroom. 
2 A child who is a native speaker of Hawai’ian Creole English may be criticized for 
speaking “school English” rather than her family’s home language at the dinner table.

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
The varieties of English spoken in peripheralized communities persist because they are a 
primary way to establish solidarity and loyalty. Minority language community ideologies 
can be just as powerful as the ideologies and strategies of the dominant bloc institutions, 
and both are worthy of study. Individuals caught between competing ideologies must learn 
to deal with this “push–pull.” 
The argument put forth by teachers in support of *SAE-only classrooms and schools 
generally sounds something like this: 
Student A must give up her home language in certain situations for her own good. This doesn’t 
mean she has to give it up completely; there’s no reason to deny that language; instead, redirect the 
student’s use of that language to those environments and circumstances in which it is appropriate. 
At the same time, give the student another language (*SAE) – for those situations in which it will 
be the only socially acceptable language. This is necessary if she is to pursue a career or education 
in the wider world where potential employers would otherwise reject her because of the variety of 
English she speaks. 
The NCTE guidelines for teaching the English language arts includes this very idea, but 
in different terms: 
All of us who speak English speak different varieties of English depending on whom 
we are communicating with, the circumstances involved, the purpose of the exchange, 
and other factors. Indeed, creative and communicative powers are enhanced when 
students develop and maintain multiple language competencies. 
Nonetheless, some varieties of English are more useful than others for higher 
education, for employment, and for participation in what the Conference on College 
Composition and Communication (1993) in a language policy statement calls “the 
language of wider communication.” Therefore, while we respect diversity in spoken 
and written English, we believe that all students should learn this language of wider 
communication. 
(National Council of Teachers of English 1996: 22–23) 
Teachers are directed to appreciate and respect the otherwise stigmatized languages of 
peripheral communities, but at the same time, reminded that those languages must be 
kept separate. This faux-egalitarianism is well known to African Americans and others 
who fought for the reversal of the separate but equal doctrine. As has always been the case, 
the divide between socially stigmatized and socially sanctioned language runs along very 
predictable lines: certain vernacular varieties of U.S. English should be restricted to the 
home and neighborhood, to play and informal situations, to the telling of folktales and 
stories of little or no interest to the wider world. 
With both feet firmly planted on the false assumptions of the standard language 
ideology and the literacy myth, a teacher may be adamant about the need to weed out the 
bad language and replace it with the good. To give children what they really need, these 
educators believe, they must supply them with a currency they don’t have: *SAE, which 
is deﬁned by default; it is not what these children speak. 
What is more destructive than this reliance on the idealized *SAE, however, is the way 
in which these targeted varieties of English are devalued. Ofﬁcial policies draw strong dis-
tinctions: *SAE is preferred, obligatory, appropriate, widely used, while Other Languages 
are narrow, inappropriate, and something to be tolerated rather than accepted. Fairclough,

looking at similar problems in the English school system, highlights the underlying 
ideology in formal policy statements and ﬁnds wording that “lifts the veil on a tradition 
of prescriptive bigotry towards non-standard varieties which is largely absent from the 
[Cox] Report” (1992: 37). 
Teachers and school administrators are not hesitant to put forward appropriacy 
arguments in public, as was the case with the head of the Philadelphia School Board, an 
African American woman, in explaining why it was necessary to “drum Standard English 
into the heads” of AAVE speakers: 
In the process of young people applying for jobs, employers would ask them a question 
which would elicit a response, “I bees ready for coming here next week.” This – um 
– utilization of the word and insertion of bees is rampant and I think really throws an 
employer off in terms of what the young person’s talking about. “Uh, now that you’re 
ﬁnished with me I bees going home.” . . . If we relegate them only to that narrow, 
limited, provincial dimension of life and language, we do them a disservice because I 
see that they will not go beyond the borderlines of their immediate neighborhood. 
And we have no right to do that to any child. 
(McCrum et al. 1986) 
The misinformation offered here is not uncommon: while AAVE invariant “be” is one of 
those points of contrast between AAVE and other varieties of English which elicits a lot 
of negative response, it is quite silly to claim that it would cause a breakdown in under-
standing among speakers of English. What this administrator is really saying is that 
employers have a negative emotive reaction to this feature of AAVE, which may well cause 
them to reject their fair share of the communicative burden. 
And she is right in this point. Language-focused discrimination does exist in the wider 
world, and it does have a negative impact on individuals. From this, her logic follows, 
it is necessary to eradicate this offending grammatical feature and all of AAVE in favor 
of the language – and the prejudice – of the employer. Here AAVE is narrow, limited, 
provincial – by which she means that it is restricted to inner city Philadelphia. This kind 
of appropriacy rhetoric can be found again and again across the country in arguments for 
the subordination of languages and language varieties out of social favor. Sometimes the 
argument is that the subordinated language must be eradicated (as in the Philadelphia 
case); at other times the message is softened by arguments for supplementation in the form 
of an uneven bilingualism, a separate-but-equal language policy which relegates home 
languages to the peripheral and disposable. 
In contrast, a Massachusetts teacher of Puerto Rican students makes no economic 
argument at all, but one which is purely ideological and unapologetically racist: 
These poor kids come to school speaking a hodge podge. They are all mixed up and 
don’t know any language well. As a result, they can’t even think clearly. That’s why 
they don’t learn. It’s our job to teach them language – to make up for their deﬁciency. 
And, since their parents don’t really know any language either, why should we waste 
time on Spanish? It is “good” English which has to be the focus. 
(cited in Zentella 1995: 8–9) 
In this second approach, a teacher has effectively summarized all of the conclusions drawn 
from Basil Bernstein’s theories of restricted and elaborated codes, also known as verbal

----- Page 109 (native) -----
84 
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
deﬁcit theory (1966). In Bernstein’s view, children who do not speak *SAE do not possess 
sufficient human language to think or reason, and must be helped to overcome these 
language and cultural handicaps. The fact that Bernstein’s theories and the resulting 
pedagogical innovations were thoroughly and resoundingly debunked some 40 years ago11 
is an indication of how receptive teachers can be to such rhetorical strategies. 
It seems to be easier to approach language as a one-size-ﬁts-all proposition. If there is 
only one proper language for the children in our care, and only one proper variety of that 
language – which happens to be the language of the socially and economically dominant 
– then it becomes easy, even prudent to dismiss the work that comes along with making 
teaching a dialogue rather than a lecture. 
Yet another approach to rationalizing linguistic subordination is seen in the essay 
“Standard English vs. the American Dream” (Winsboro and Solomon 1990) which con-
solidates appropriateness and economic arguments with assimilationist rhetoric: 
While we must continue to manifest pluralistic approaches to integrating Black 
English into the curriculum, as necessary, we must simultaneously teach those who 
speak with a dialect that a realistic chance of success in American society is frequently 
based on mastery of Standard English. 
Studies consistently demonstrate that educators manifest a generally negative reaction to 
the “less familiar dialect” in favor of *SAE. Black educators are candid about the socio-
economic disadvantages of speaking AAVE in a predominantly Anglo society. Often, 
African Americans are the most vehement supporters of *SAE and intolerant of the very 
idea of AAVE. To further complicate this issue, those educators are understandably 
hesitant to consider what it means if the language ideology they have embraced turns out 
to be based on fallacies. 
Vershawn Ashanti Young is an example of an African American teacher and scholar 
who has looked carefully at these complex and sensitive issues, which he has experienced 
from both sides: as a boy growing up in Chicago’s Horner Projects, and as someone who 
left that life behind himself and became a professor of rhetoric. Young writes about a 
student, Cam, who comes into his classroom and deliberately uses AAVE to draw attention 
to things that Young has taken great pains to suppress in himself. Young asks: “What had 
I really achieved if Black males like Cam were coming to college and being successful? 
And would not my validating his use of the vernacular in order to affirm his Black 
masculine identity demean my own?” (Young 2007: 93). 
Evidence clearly suggests that speakers of Black English and Hawai’i Creole English 
are presented with more obstacles to educational success than professed speakers of *SAE. 
The consequences are broad, not only in the way individuals are silenced, but also because 
the community as a whole is deprived of those voices, and the contributions that would 
have been. 
Those who argue that it is right and good to help those children substitute *SAE for 
their home languages never seem to carry the argument to its ultimate conclusion. First, 
it has been established that teachers discriminate against speakers of stigmatized varieties 
of English; second, it is agreed that in such an atmosphere of rejection, no child can thrive. 
From these two facts come the conclusion that *SAE must be acquired and the vernacular 
put aside. This may seem to be common sense and logical, but it is in fact logical only in 
so far as one accepts the underlying premise of linguistic superiority and the primacy of 
economic motivations.

FACT: Language A and Language B are equal in linguistic and cultural terms. → 
FACT: Language B is rejected by teachers and employers. → 
FACT: Rejection has a negative effect on the speakers of Language B. 
↓ 
*CONCLUSION: Language B must be discarded in favor of Language A. 
When successful middle-class African Americans argue that AAVE must not be tolerated 
in public forums, the tone is often highly defensive, and one reason for that must be the 
awareness of the undeniable conclusion that to take such a stance is “surrendering to 
prejudice” (Young 2007: 108–109). 
The teacher discriminates because the employer does; the child pays the price of that 
discrimination by accommodating and assimilating. The only way to achieve pluralistic 
goals, we are told, is to make everyone alike. In a confrontation between the powered and 
the disempowered, it is very rarely the empowered who must give way in the resolution 
of conﬂict. It is never suggested that speakers of language A stop and consider the nature 
of their prejudice, and how to end it. 
The results of appropriacy argumentation 
By the time they ﬁnish their elementary education, most children are ﬁrm believers in the 
appropriacy argument. If they are native speakers of a language other than *SAE, they will 
confess their uneasiness: “The more you get into [learning *SAE],” says a student in South 
Carolina, “the more I realize not how bad I sound but how much better I could sound” 
(ABC Evening News, December 15, 1991). 
“I don’t want my accent to hurt my self-esteem anymore,” says a native speaker of 
Spanish. “I know I can get my point across in English, but I don’t want to feel uncom-
fortable every time I say something” (Hernandez 1993: 1). 
In a series of studies using matched-guise testing, Carranza and Ryan (1975) showed 
that African American, Anglo and Hispanic students all found Spanish-accented English 
to be lacking in prestige and inappropriate for a classroom setting. According to Ryan, 
Carranza and Mofﬁe (1977) “Small increments in accentedness were found to be associated 
with gradually less favorable ratings of status, solidarity, and speech characteristics” (as 
summarized in Eisenstein 1983: 173). 
In the teaching of language, there is a very striking division between educational psy-
chologists and theorists, on the one side, and boards of education and classroom teachers, 
on the other. The NCTE circulates a publication list to its 90,000 members which includes 
titles such as Kids Come in All Languages (Spangenberg-Urbschat and Pritchard 1994) and 
(more than 20 years ago) Afﬁrming Students’ Right to Their Own Language (McCrum et al. 
1986). For the most part, these are well-balanced reports on those factual issues which 
should be clear to every teacher involved in language instruction. 
In spite of the availability of such resources, however, the language arts classroom is 
one of the best places to watch the way that language communities and individuals who 
do not use *SAE are subordinated by means of misinformation, trivialization, and a 
carefully constructed set of threats and promises.

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
Good enough English 
In the second half of the nineteenth century, the U.S. government was hard pressed to 
find some kind of lasting resolution for the on-going conflicts with the continent’s 
indigenous peoples. Disease, warfare and systematic routing had reduced the great variety 
of native cultures to a handful. Tribes that were not wiped out entirely were decimated 
often to less than 10 percent of their original numbers (Stannard 1992). By the mid-
nineteenth century, the Native American diaspora and the accelerated western push by 
European immigrants had increased pressure to find a lasting solution. A remedy was 
needed which moved beyond the writing of treaties which the U.S. government drew up 
and signed, but ignored at whim. 
In a series of policy statements written between 1868 and 1887, the Federal 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs put down a very clear strategy which involved moving 
away from traditional warfare to a policy which depended on forcibly breaking up family 
and tribal units to speed up the process of assimilation. Very astutely, the commissioner 
pinpointed the matter of language as crucial. Without tribal languages which functioned 
as the primary marker of social identity and provided a cohesive force in the face of so 
much turmoil, the indigenous peoples could be more easily drawn into the fold. His 
reasoning is worth quoting at length: 
The white and Indian must mingle together and jointly occupy the country, or one 
of them must abandon it . . . by educating the children of these tribes in the English 
language these differences would have disappeared, and civilization would have 
followed at once. Nothing then would have been left but the antipathy of race, and 
that, too, is always softened in the beams of a higher civilization . . . through sameness 
of language is produced sameness of sentiment, and thoughts; customs and habits are 
molded and assimilated in the same way, and thus in process of time the differences 
producing trouble would have been gradually obliterated . . . in the difference of 
language to-day lies two-thirds of our trouble . . . schools should be established, which 
children should be required to attend; their barbarous dialects should be blotted out 
and the English language substituted . . .The object of greatest solicitude should be 
to break down the prejudices of tribe among the Indians; to blot out the boundary 
lines which divided them into distinct nations, and fuse them into one homogeneous 
mass. Uniformity in language will do this – nothing else will . . .There is not an Indian 
pupil whose tuition and maintenance is paid for by the United States Government 
who is permitted to study any other language than our own vernacular – the language 
of the greatest, most powerful, and enterprising nationalities beneath the sun. The 
English language as taught in America is good enough for all her people of all races. 
(Atkins 1887, as quoted in Crawford 1992: 48–49) 
Reading this passage, one is calmed, somewhat, by its date. This was written over a 
hundred years ago, the rationalization might go. We have a more democratic and fair-
handed approach now. We are making slow progress on the rights of the continent’s 
indigenous peoples. 
In matters of indigenous language use and retention, there is some evidence that the 
native peoples are determining their own educational language policies and looking for 
ways to encourage use of the mother tongue. New Mexico, in particular, has instituted 
procedures by which state educational administrators work together with tribal authorities

----- Page 112 (native) -----
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM

to set up bilingual education policies acceptable to the tribal administration. This would 
seem to be a necessity in a state where 73.1 percent of the population was born in Mexico 
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2006–2008 American Community Survey Three-Year Estimates). 
As a part of these policies, the New Mexico Department of Education worked together 
with the Pueblo Indian community, for example, to establish an assessment protocol for 
those Pueblos who teach in the bilingual education program (Sims 1992). Because each 
tribe has a different set of views on bilingual education, each designs its own program.12 
More recently, New Mexico has instituted a path to alternative certification that has 
provided a way for American Indian language speakers to teach language and culture in 
public schools. Even more important, it gave tribes in New Mexico the means to conceive 
and develop internal tribal certiﬁcation processes of their own (see especially American 
Indian Language Policy Research and Teacher Training Center 2008). In a similar way, 
there are healthy and growing immersion schools for the Kanien’kehaka (Mohawk) – 
primarily in Canada – where policy and curriculum are directed exclusively by and for that 
language community. 
But these are questions of bilingualism, it must be pointed out, and since the first 
boarding school for Native Americans was opened at Carlisle in Pennsylvania (Coleman 
1993), the language issue for Native Americans has become complicated by the develop-
ment of varieties of English distinct both from tribal languages and the English of non-
Native Americans. Thus, much like Mexican-Americans, Native Americans are confronted 
with educational challenges of two types: bilingualism, and bidialectalism. Leap (1992) 
makes the salient point that for each Native American tribal language there is a distinct 
and functioning variety of English with phonological, morphological, syntactic and 
discourse features speciﬁc to it. This variety of English must be taken into consideration 
in the classroom, and not just as an object to be replaced with another, less socially 
stigmatized *SAE. 
In the current day, language education policies are rarely overtly racist or Eurocentric, 
and it is precisely for that reason that they work so well. There are no conspiracy plots to 
kidnap Mexican children in Texas or Chinese children in San Francisco or Arabic children 
in Detroit. Educators do not suggest that children of a speciﬁc ethnicity or race would be 
better off if they were removed from their homes. We ask those children to learn English, 
the argument goes, but it’s for their own good. The more they willingly submit to 
mainstreaming, the better the mainstream will treat them. 
The most commonly heard position on this issue of the appropriate language of 
education was summarized quite saliently by William J. Bennett, a former Secretary of 
Education: 
Our origins are diverse. Yet we live together as fellow citizens, in harmony . . . Each 
of us is justly proud of his own ethnic heritage. But we share this pride, in common, 
as Americans, as American citizens. To be a citizen is to share in something common 
– common principles, common memories, and a common language in which to discuss 
our common affairs. Our common language is, of course, English. And our common 
task is to ensure that our non-English-speaking children learn this common language 
. . . We expect much of [our schools] – to impart basic skills, to help form character, 
to teach citizenship. And we expect our schools to help teach all of our students, the 
common language that will enable them to participate fully in our political, economic, 
and social life. 
(Bennett 1988)

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
Maybe we would like to believe that current-day policies are more enlightened, that things 
have improved over the past 20 years, but evidence indicates that the opposite is true. 
Reading academic work on issues of language rights in the schools, one established theme 
comes repeatedly to the surface: separate but equal language policies are ugly, but 
necessary. 
Valencia and Solórzano provide a sobering overview of educational policies founded 
on the idea of language deﬁcit, and come to a simple conclusion: “Whether its rationale 
is genetics, poverty, culture and language, or home environment, the end result is that the 
deﬁcit ideology defrauds marginalized students” (2004: 125). 
The debates around bilingual education seem to pose very simple questions: 
Should children be required to learn English, and learn in English, regardless of their 
own home languages and the primary languages of their communities? 
Can one policy – based on allegedly common views of the responsibilities of citizenship 
– be just for all students in all schools, whether that child is a native speaker of Navajo, 
Arabic, or Spanish? 
Despite many years of debate and experimentation no resolutions have been found, but a 
different question might help clarify some of the issues: If by magic it were possible to 
make every school-aged child in the nation instantaneously bilingual, equally proﬁcient 
in English and in their native language, would the problem of discrimination in the schools 
go away? 
Teacher talk 
Formal expectations about teachers’ language skills are easy enough to document. Each 
state has a complex administrative body which is responsible for reviewing and licensing 
teachers, and each publishes those guidelines openly. Guidelines for Michigan, New 
Mexico, California and New York, for example, all have similar language about the native 
language skills of any teacher, which include phrases such as “demonstrates excellent skills 
of pronunciation and grammar” and “carries out instruction in content areas of the 
curriculum using a standard variety of the native language” (New Mexico guidelines, 
effective July 1, 1989). Whether or not this latter expectation is realistic or enforceable is 
never addressed. 
While the ofﬁcial pronunciation and accent test once administered by New York City 
to prospective teachers is no longer used, such policies have been employed elsewhere: in 
the 1970s, speakers of Chicano English were still failing the speech test required for 
teacher certiﬁcation in California (Pelosa 1981: 8), while in 2010 Arizona Governor Jan 
Brewer signed a controversial Anti-immigration Act into law. As a result, the Board of 
Education initiated a purge that would remove teachers with “heavy accents” from class-
rooms. These measures were met with great enthusiasm by Tom Horne, Superintendent 
of Public Instruction, who had long been agitating for the exclusion of ethnic studies from 
those Tucson schools where Mexican American students were rude to him and critical of 
his administration. Note that it is on the basis of his dislike of a “small group of students” 
that he argues for abandonment of the entire Ethnic Studies curriculum. Note also the 
blatant partisanship:

----- Page 114 (native) -----

An open letter to the citizens of Tucson . . . 
The citizens of Tucson, of all mainstream political ideologies, would call for the 
elimination of the Tucson Uniﬁed School District’s ethnic studies program if they 
knew what was happening there . . . I personally observed this at the Tucson Magnet 
School. My Deputy, Margaret Garcia Dugan, who is Latina and Republican, came 
to refute the allegation made earlier to the student body, that “Republicans hate 
Latinos.” Her speech was non-partisan and professional, urging students to think for 
themselves, and avoid stereotypes. Yet, a small group of La Raza [Ethnic studies] 
students treated her rudely, and when the principal asked them to sit down and listen, 
they deﬁantly walked out. By contrast, teenage Republicans listened politely when 
Delores Huerta told the entire student body that “Republicans hate Latinos.” In 
hundreds of visits to schools, I’ve never seen students act rudely and in deﬁance of 
authority, except in this one unhappy case. I believe the students did not learn this 
rudeness at home, but from their Raza teachers. 
(Horne, June 11, 2007) 
Just three years after this letter was made public, Arizona citizens passed laws that brought 
Horne’s vision of a homogenous and obedient student body closer to realization: 
While much condemnation has rightly been expressed toward Arizona’s anti-
immigrant law, SB 1070, a less-reported and potentially more sinister measure is set 
to take effect on January 1, 2011. This new law, which was passed by the conservative 
state legislature at the behest of then-School Superintendent (and now Attorney 
General-elect) Tom Horne, is designated HB 2281 and is colloquially referred to as 
a measure to ban ethnic studies programs in the state. As with SB 1070, the implications 
of this law are problematic, wide-ranging and decidedly hate-ﬁlled . . . With HB 2281, 
the intention is not so much to expel or harass as it is to inculcate a deep-seated, second-
class status by denying people the right to explore their own histories and cultures. It 
is, in effect, about the eradication of ethnic identity among young people in the state’s 
already-ﬂoundering school system, which now ranks near the bottom in the nation. 
(Amster 2011) 
Even in parts of the country where ethnic studies and bilingual education are less volatile 
subjects, it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd school systems with formal guidelines designed to win-
now teachers with social and regional accents out of the teaching force. In a telephone 
interview, a high-level administrator in a major eastern school district was quite candid, 
speaking on the matter of accent in the teaching force. He noted that in the evaluation of 
potential employees, there are different sets of expectations, so that 
if you are interviewing for a laboratory specialist who has no contact with the students, 
then you have lower expectations. An African-American accent would be more 
acceptable in a phys ed teacher, for example, than it would be in a teacher of speech. 
(Director of Evaluation Programs, interviewed June 1994)13 
These issues rarely come to the attention of the public, unless the news media takes inter-
est in some particular case, as in the 1992 controversy around teachers with foreign accents 
in Westﬁeld, Massachusetts, a town of about 36,000 people and a broad ethnic mix.14 
In July of that year, a petition signed by 403 residents was presented to the school board 
in protest of a decision to reassign two bilingual education teachers to positions as regular

----- Page 115 (native) -----

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
classroom teachers. The petition speciﬁcally addressed the issue of accent, urging that no 
teacher be assigned to ﬁrst or second grade classrooms “who is not thoroughly proﬁcient 
in the English language in terms of grammar, syntax, and – most important – the accepted 
and standardized use of pronunciation.” 
George Varelas, former mayor of Westﬁeld and simultaneously the chair of the city’s 
school committee, had spearheaded the effort behind this petition, promoting it vocally 
and with the press. Mr. Varelas is himself a native speaker of Greek and speaks English 
with that accent, but he found this proposal to the school board a compelling one. 
“Persons like myself – and I cannot be confused with someone from Boston or Alabama 
– should not be in a self-contained classroom for a full year teaching 5- and 6-year olds 
the multitude of phonetic differences that exist in the English language,” the Mayor said 
in an interview. “I would only impart my confusion and give them my defects in terms of 
language” (New York Times, July 5, 1992, Sec. 1, p. 12). 
A debate ensued between Mr. Varelas and Piedad Robertson, a native of Cuba, former 
kindergarten teacher and at the time of the petition, Massachusetts Secretary of Education. 
Ms. Robertson openly called for the rejection of the petition: “instead of fostering the 
acceptance of cultural diversity, [it] would appear to encourage bigotry, racism, and 
discrimination” (ibid.). 
In the end, the school board voted down the petition quite resoundingly, but whether 
or not this was out of conviction of the wrongness of the proposal or the fact that the State 
Attorney General had pointed out that it would violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 
is unclear. After the issue settled, a number of questions had yet to be answered. 
Commentators observed that the parents feared not so much that the teachers would be 
incomprehensible, but that their children would pick up the teacher’s accent. 
In linguistic terms, this fear has no foundation. Children learn their phonologies ﬁrst 
from their families and then from their peers, and that process is largely ﬁnished by the 
time they get to school. Phonetics and phonology do not pass from adult to children like 
viruses. A teacher provides a language role model, certainly, but of a different type: with 
schooling the lexicon and stylistic repertoire expands, but these are additions to the basic 
structure or the grammar of language, which is well established by age 6. In terms of the 
Sound House analogy used in Chapter 3 of this book, a child has already constructed a 
Sound House by the time they enter school. If any major remodeling is done (and it can 
be done at this age), the moving of walls or the addition of a staircase, it is done out of 
wanting to imitate the Sound Houses of other children. In contrast, the stylistic effects of 
certain grammatical strategies and lexical items might be seen as interior decorating with 
drapes and carpets, fabrics and colors, and will be greatly affected by the acquisition of 
literacy and hence by interaction with the teacher. Accent is not an issue; communicative 
effectiveness may be, but that is true whatever the native language of the teacher. 
While these fears are easily addressed, the underlying issues remain. There is con-
siderable resistance in this country to teachers with foreign accents, and nowhere is that 
resistance so loudly voiced as in the university setting. Most large research universities 
with graduate programs employ graduate students to teach, or assist in teaching, large 
introductory courses in their areas of expertise and scholarship. This is both a reasonable 
part of the training of future teachers, and an economic necessity in larger institutions. 
Many of these graduate students come from outside the U.S., and speak English as a 
second language and with an L2 accent. Emotions on the matter of graduate student 
instructors in the classroom sometimes run very high. The following examples all originate 
at the University of Michigan, during my tenure there:

A more recent experience concerns my daughter, a recent graduate of the engineering 
college. Most of her undergraduate experience was with TAs, many of whom were ill 
equipped to communicate the language let alone ideas. For $10,000 a year in out-of-
state tuition we expected more.

the University of Michigan LSA magazine) 
The ONE problem with Ann Arbor (aside from construction, too many coffee shops): 
Graduate Student Instructors who don’t know how to speak English. 
(From a column in the student paper, The Michigan Daily, April 18, 1996) 
Of course it’s hard to understand them, and of course I resent it. Why can’t I get what 
I pay for, which is a teacher like me who talks to me in my own language that I can 
understand? 
(From a questionnaire distributed annually 
to incoming students in a linguistics course) 
The issues raised here, directly and indirectly, have to do with unmet student expectations. 
One set of expectations has to do with the contract between student and university, both 
formal and implied. Whether or not that contract is fairly interpreted to include student 
preferences on the nationality or ethnicity of instructors and faculty cannot be taken up 
here. What is relevant to this discussion are the issues of accent, comprehensibility, and 
communication. 
In response to complaints from the University of Michigan student body on this issue, 
the university administration took a number of steps to ensure that graduate student 
instructors were indeed prepared to teach in English. The Center for Research on 
Learning and Teaching, in cooperation with the English Language Institute, also provided 
extensive training for teaching assistants whose ﬁrst language was not English, including 
a three-week intensive workshop.15 International TAs must successfully complete the 
workshop and also must pass an oral proﬁciency screening before being allowed to teach. 
Those who do not pass the oral screening continue to take English classes until their 
English is acceptable. 
In an open letter to the student body, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and 
Sciences drew up a set of proposed remedies for the students’ unhappiness about faculty 
with foreign accents. While the university recognizes its responsibility in screening and 
training non-native speakers of English who will be given teaching responsibilities, there 
is no parallel recognition of the need to educate undergraduates to discern between real 
communicative difﬁculties and those stemming not from language, but from stereotype 
and bias. 
These issues are also relevant for faculty with advanced degrees; a Ph.D. cannot render 
anyone accentless. Undergraduate complaints, however, focus almost exclusively on gradu-
ate student teachers, which indicates that the underlying issues are complicated by the 
power and authority structures of any university setting. Undergraduates who come into 
the university system directly from high school are often very unclear on the organization 
of the faculty and the degree system; they might not even realize what roles a graduate 
student instructor plays. As a body, graduate student teachers seem to occupy a role in the 
minds of the undergraduates which is both subordinate and superordinate: because they

----- Page 117 (native) -----
92 
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
teach, evaluate and grade, they have a signiﬁcant amount of power. Conversely, because 
they are themselves still in training and perhaps close in age to their undergraduate stu-
dents, they may be perceived as socially subordinate in ways which clash with origin, 
academic expectations and language, thus undergraduate willingness to challenge the 
graduate students’ authority seems to rise exponentially (Table 6.1). 
A small body of research has been established which moves beyond the anecdotal data 
usually called forth in this debate. A few studies have concentrated on the undergraduate’s 
ability to distinguish between accents and make fair assessments of English proﬁciency. 
Orth (1982) found that undergraduates were not very good at making such assessments; 
their evaluations of non-native English-speaking instructors were biased by the grades 
they anticipated receiving from the instructor. More recently, a group of Canadian and 
American scholars have looked very closely at issues of comprehensibility, intelligibility 
and the importance of listener attitude for students of English as a second language (please 
see suggested additional readings at the end of this chapter). 
Such studies indicate that success in communication between L1 and L2 speakers is far 
more complex than has been suggested here. For example, native speakers of Chinese, 
Japanese, Polish, Spanish and English listened to the same set of recordings of English 
spoken with a foreign accent. Despite the differences in their native languages, they 
showed an unexpected degree of agreement on the intelligibility and accentedness of the 
recordings (Munro et al. 2006). That is, a native Japanese speaker is no more or less able 
to understand Japanese-accented English than a native English speaker, which suggests 
that the properties of speech itself are important in how accent is perceived. 
Rubin and Smith (1990) found that students were not always able to distinguish between 
different levels of accentedness and yet perceptions, right or wrong, served as a very good 
predictor of how the student rated the teacher. Thus, if students assessed an instructor 
with a very slight Cantonese accent as highly accented, they also found that person to be 
a poor teacher. In another study that drew a great deal of attention, Rubin (1992) used an 
interesting technique to see how students’ expectations of foreign instructors played into 
their attitudes and learning experience. 
In that study of how expectations built around accent and race affected student per-
ceptions and performance, 62 undergraduate native speakers of English participated. 
Each undergraduate listened to a 4-minute lecture on an introductory topic, pre-recorded 
on tape. There were two possible lectures, one on a science topic and the other on a 
humanities topic. While listening, the student saw a projected slide photograph which was 
meant to represent the instructor speaking. Both of the recordings heard were made by 
the same speaker (a native speaker of English from central Ohio), but there were two 
possible projected photographs: half of the students saw a slide of a Caucasian woman

lecturer, and the other half saw a woman similarly dressed and of the same size and hair 
style, but who was Asian. Both were photographed in the same setting and in the same 
pose, and in fact no difference was registered between the Caucasian and the Asian 
photographs in terms of physical attractiveness. 
Immediately after listening to the 4-minute lecture, each student completed a test 
of listening comprehension, and then a testing procedure which was designed to test 
homophily, which in effect asks the respondents to compare the person speaking to 
themselves and to judge the degree of similarity or difference. This measurement has been 
found to be very useful in studying communicative breakdown across cultural boundaries. 
Studies indicate that students “respond more positively to teachers of optimal homophily” 
(ibid.: 513). There were other items included in this questionnaire which asked the students 
to rate accent (speaks with an American accent, speaks with an Asian accent), ethnicity, 
and quality of teaching. 
Figures 6.2 and 6.3 indicate that students clearly perceived the difference in ethnicity 
in the slides they looked at. As hypothesized, the Asian instructor was perceived to be more 
“Oriental/Asian” than was the Caucasian instructor, regardless of the subject of the lecture. 
These ﬁgures indicate that perceived ethnicity on the basis of the photograph did have 
a great deal of signiﬁcance on the way students evaluated language. Depending on the 
slide projected, the students evaluated the same native speaker of U.S. English as having 
more or less of a foreign accent. To put it more bluntly, some students who saw an Asian

were incapable of hearing objectively. It can be stated with absolute certainty that the pre-
recorded language they listened to was native, non-foreign-accented English; students 
looking at an Asian face, however, sometimes convinced themselves that they heard an 
accent. Here it becomes clear that the students’ negative preconceptions are at work. 
Even more interesting is the fact that overall, students scored lower in the com-
prehension test when they believed that the lecturer was Asian (Figure 6.4). Not only were 
some of these students incapable of hearing objectively when confronted with an Asian 
face, their block extended to the way they absorbed and understood factual material. This 
was more extreme in the case of the science lecture, something not totally unpredictable. 
Rubin notes: 
For many undergraduates, introductory courses in mathematics and the natural 
sciences have reputations as extremely inhumane courses designed to winnow out 
marginal students. And it is well known that [non-native English speaking graduate 
student teachers] are disproportionately assigned responsibility for such high-anxiety 
classes. 
(1992: 512) 
Thus it seems likely that preconceptions and fear are strong enough motivators to cause 
students to construct imaginary accents, and ﬁctional communicative breakdowns.

The proposed rationale for the rejection of instructors with foreign accents in teaching 
must be carefully examined: 
ACCENT → COMMUNICATIVE BREAKDOWN → POOR  
CLASSROOM/LEARNING EXPERIENCE  
Rubin’s study indicates that whether or not an instructor actually does need further 
training in English may be irrelevant, if racial and ethnic cues are more important than 
degree of accentedness. If any cue is enough to shift the communicative burden entirely 
to the other party, the formula takes on another dimension: 
INSTRUCTOR’S PERCEIVED ACCENT → STUDENTS’ NEGATIVE 
EXPECTATIONS 
↓ 
COMMUNICATIVE BREAKDOWN → POOR CLASSROOM  
EXPERIENCE  
Of course, it is possible that a true communicative breakdown may cause difficulties 
between a non-native speaker of English and a student. One important difference remains,

----- Page 121 (native) -----

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
though. A student new to the lecture hall has no way of knowing whether or not the person 
teaching the course is going to be a good communicator and dedicated teacher or not, but 
the native language of the instructor is incidental to this question. Native speakers of 
English are usually given the beneﬁt of the doubt; some turn out to be good teachers, and 
others do not. However, non-native speakers of English – speciﬁcally, speakers of Asian, 
African and South American languages – are often not given a chance at all. 
While universities and colleges across the country are trying hard to deal with the 
complicated issue of graduate student instructors who are not native speakers of English, 
it seems that policies to address the question of quality of classroom instruction have to 
take a broader view. Foreign students need help in acclimating to a very different academic 
and social culture, in a variety of matters. Language is of primary importance, and deserves 
careful attention. In addition to the training of the foreign students, it must be noted that 
our own students have to be educated about matters of language and communication in 
the classroom, and be taught to take a reasonable amount of responsibility for a successful 
educational experience. 
Summary 
Educators have a difﬁcult job. We want them to provide our children with a great variety 
of skills, from reading and writing to job training. Furthermore, we entrust them with 
teaching our children the basics of good citizenship and responsible behavior as social and 
sexual beings; we charge them with occupying and entertaining, even on occasion with 
passing on parenting skills. On top of all these expectations, we want the teacher to give 
our children that mythical perfect spoken language we call *SAE, a language which is 
grammatically homogenous and accentless. Whether or not the child can do anything 
constructive with that language is in many instances secondary to the social construction 
of accent. 
Teachers have responded to these expectations by developing authority structures 
around language – written and spoken – which are projected as absolute and inviolate. We 
trust their intuitions and whims above all others. This authority is sometimes abused. 
Teachers are for the most part ﬁrm believers in a standard language ideology which rejects 
or marginalizes those varieties of U.S. English which are markedly non-middle-class, 
middle American, and colorless. Arguments for this overt limitation of discourse which 
affects huge numbers of children are usually based in economics. If asked about a wider 
possible view, and policies of acceptance, every teacher will point to the other institutions 
which support and propagate a standard language ideology. Employers have expectations, 
they will argue. There will be repercussions. 
The teachers themselves are capable of seeing this circular logic: “Since English teachers 
have been in large part responsible for the narrow attitudes of today’s employers, changing 
attitudes toward dialect variations does not seem an unreasonable goal, for today’s students 
will be tomorrow’s employers” (The National Council of Teachers of English 1974), but 
actual attempts to resolve this conﬂict are harder to ﬁnd. 
Are there no examples of educators with more informed and enlightened approaches 
to diversity in language? Teachers who strive to teach children to read and write, and at 
the same time respect the wholeness of the home language and the social identity attached 
to it? Are there teachers who question underlying assumptions?

----- Page 122 (native) -----

97 
Of course there are. At a college in the Midwest, there is at least one single English 
teacher who does not ﬁnd it necessary to eradicate one variety of English to teach reading 
and writing in another. The Chicago Tribune found this method so remarkable that they 
ran an article on the approach, and highlighted a classroom practice of “[not] scold[ing] 
Black students . . . when they said ‘ax,’ rather than ‘ask’” (Warren 1993: 2). In New Mexico, 
the Hopi Nation oversees the training and evaluation of bilingual teachers who come from 
the community and teach in the community, so that the experiences of Luther Standing 
Bear do not have to be repeated. A Sioux enrolled in an English-Only boarding school, 
he wrote, “How hard it was to forego the consolation of speech” (Standing Bear 1928, as 
cited in Reyhner and Eder 2006). 
These stories of teachers and administrators who resist the process of language 
subordination are rare. What our schools do, for the most part, is to insist that some 
children forego the expressive power and consolation of speech which is the currency of 
their home communities. This gesture of denial and symbolic subordination is projected 
as a ﬁrst and necessary step to becoming a good student and a good citizen. 
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
Write your own linguistic history. Where did your inﬂuences come from? What ideologies 
were you exposed to? Which did you accept, and to what degree? Have you studied 
any foreign languages? Do you feel as though you could survive in a country where that 
language is spoken? What would it take? 
Do you have any memories of being corrected for the way you said something? Who did 
the correcting? What reason was given, and how did you react? Anger? Shame? 
Confusion? 
Describe your own experiences in school. Were there speakers of stigmatized varieties 
of English in your classroom? Were you one of those speakers? How did perceptions 
make things easier or harder for them (or you)? 
Search online in communities that discuss education and look for terms such as “standard 
English,” “non-standard English,” “dialect,” “grammar,” and “ugly.” Was it easy or hard 
to ﬁnd discussions of the issues covered in this chapter? What trends (if any) did you 
come across? 
Interview a friend who has never taken a linguistics class. Ask that person for deﬁnitions 
of “standard” and “non-standard” English, and be sure to ask for examples. Don’t 
give away your thoughts or reactions, just record what your informant has to say, no 
matter how much you agree or disagree. Compare your findings with others in the 
class.

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
Have the materials in this chapter raised questions for you? Doubts? Do you feel the 
same way you did before this course on matters of language in the classroom? 
Write a short list of guidelines you might go over with a biology class where all of the 
teaching assistants are non-native speakers of English. How can the students contribute 
to making communication work? Are there concrete steps to take when communication 
breaks down? 
Interview a graduate teaching assistant or a professor or instructor who speaks English 
with a strong accent of any kind that contrasts with the average person on campus. For 
example, someone with a strong Texas accent teaching in Northern California, or 
someone whose ﬁrst language is Japanese teaching in Cincinnati. Ask what experiences 
they have had because of accent. Positive, negative, neutral? 
Notes 
1 Between 1996 until the writing of the second edition of this book, there has been no 
ofﬁcial or published revision to the NCTE’s Standards for the English Language Arts. 
2 A 2003 study went one step further, asking non-academic professionals to evaluate 66 
written sentences, each with one error (and a few with no errors, as a control). Their 
choices were “does not bother me,” “bothers me a little,” “bothers me a lot,” or “no 
error.” The researchers found that the professionals were very inconsistent and 
sometimes incorrect in their evaluations, and more interesting still, “while nonacademics 
are less bothered by usage errors, the errors that they ﬁnd most bothersome are still 
common dialectical features” (Gray and Heuser 2003). In other words, the subjects had 
retained bias and ideology better than the grammatical rules they had been taught. 
3 Here I touch only brieﬂy on the question of children who come to school speaking a 
language other than English. Native speakers of Russian and Portuguese, for example, 
face a different set of institutionalized challenges. Bilingual education is an important 
– and very large – topic that cannot be addressed in any depth here. 
4 The U.S. Department of Education is the home of the NAEP (National Assessment 
of Educational Progress) which is the “primary federal entity for collecting and 
analyzing data related to education” (NAEP website at: http://nces.ed.gov/). NAEP 
makes their raw data available to other public and private organizations, one of which 
is the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The NAEP uses a three-level assessment of 
achievement levels, in which reading skills are ranked as basic, proﬁcient or advanced

essay “The Historic Struggle for Language Rights in the CCCC.” 
7 There comes a point where the argument for a strictly standardized written language 
will also collapse. In creative writing of all kinds, the rules of the written standard are 
sacriﬁced for the sake of story.

length.

does not evoke the same kind of strong reactions that AAVE does, which makes it 
especially useful in trying to grasp the issues discussed here. 
10 Appropriacy arguments are not always inappropriate, and often quite necessary when 
it comes to matters of public behavior. Children who get into a ﬁght on the playground 
hear words like inappropriate and unacceptable. 
11 See especially Labov’s “The Logic of Non-Standard English” (1972c), which is pur-
posefully polemic but also illustrates the inaccuracy of Bernstein’s theories very clearly.

13 Quotes in this section originate from a series of telephone interviews conducted with 
school administrators in four states: two in the Northeast, one in the Midwest, one in

and administers the testing and evaluation procedure for an entire state. Most parties 
agreed to be interviewed and quoted only if they remained anonymous. Notes from 
these interviews as well as partial transcripts are on ﬁle with the author. Questions 
were posed about the way teachers were evaluated in matters of language, and the 
hiring process more generally.

Teaching children how to discriminate 7  
(What we learn from the Big Bad Wolf)1 
We are faced first-off with indexical facts, facts of observed/experienced social 
practices, the systematicity of which is our central problem: are they systematic? If 
so, how? 
Silverstein (1992: 322) 
“Poor little guy! He just makes mistakes. He doesn’t know any better. I’ll just have 
to be patient and teach him the right way to do things,” said Mickey. 
Disney Inc., “Mickey Mouse and The Boy Thursday” (1948) 
Storytellers, Inc. 
This chapter is about the ways children are systematically exposed to a standard language 
ideology by means of linguistic stereotypes in ﬁlm or television entertainment. 
Stories are more than entertainment, of course. Stories are in fact essential to the species 
and “second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and shelter” (Price 
1978: xiii). As all human beings dream, we also all think and structure our understanding 
of the world in terms of narrative. A child takes in his or her family and community’s 
stories and begins to experiment with storytelling at a young age. This process is crucial 
to socialization; thus, it is fair to say that storytellers have a crucial role to play in the lives 
of children. 
Since the early twentieth century, the broadcast media have steadily increased in 
importance as agents of socialization. While we tend to think of Disney as a magical 
kingdom (mostly because Disney has convinced us this is so), in fact it is ﬁrst and foremost 
a large and complex corporation. As such, its ﬁrst and primary concern is its shareholders, 
and shareholders are primarily interested in proﬁt, something a former head of Disney 
made clear in a memo to his staff: “We have no obligation to make history. We have no 
obligation to make art. We have no obligation to make a statement. To make money is 
our only objective” (Rowan 2005; Stepakoff 2007: 170). 
To maintain and increase its customer base, Disney constantly reintroduces children 
to their world view. What sets Disney apart from other corporations is the fact that all 
this goes on in an indulgent atmosphere where critical discussion is actively discouraged 
(Giroux and Pollock 2010; Ward 2002). For example, while there may be scattered protests 
about gender roles, racism and historical inaccuracies in Disney ﬁlms, those complaints 
never seem to have much of an impact on box-ofﬁce numbers.

----- Page 127 (native) -----
102 
TEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO DISCRIMINATE 
Giroux suggests reasoning for pursuing the questions raised here: 
Questioning what Disney teaches is part of a much broader inquiry regarding what 
it is parents, children, educators and others need to know in order to critique and 
challenge, when necessary, those institutional and cultural forces that have a direct 
impact on public life. 
(2001: 10–11) 
To look at this from another angle, most people reading this book will consider themselves 
to be free of racism. If that is truly the case, then a question comes up that few people are 
comfortable discussing: in this enlightened twenty-ﬁrst century, how is it that inequality 
persists? 
Bonilla-Silva suggests that this conﬂict (we are not racists; racism persists) is one that 
the privileged resolve by looking elsewhere for explanations – the concept of market forces 
is a favorite stand-in or pretext for racism, as will be seen in Chapter 14 when employers 
are asked directly about the way ﬁeld workers are hired. In this way the dominant group 
develops standardization ideologies which can be called upon when the conﬂict becomes 
too visible for comfort (Bonilla-Silva 2009: 3–11). The privileged have become expert at 
talking about race without talking directly about race. This is something to keep in mind 
while reading this chapter. 
The purpose here is not to condemn Disney or any other producer of animated ﬁlm;2 
but neither is it reasonable to simply overlook, rationalize or laugh off discriminatory and 
exclusionary behaviors, especially given the ubiquitous presence of Disney in the lives of 
children. That is, while nothing may be gained by latching onto what seem to be trivialities, 
neither is any progress made by refusing to look more closely at systematic patterns that 
have a profound impact on the way children come to see the world. 
To discuss Disney’s role in the socialization of young children, it is first necessary 
to demonstrate that their products have a regular, systematic effect on children on a 
day-to-day basis, and that children are inﬂuenced by the content of what they are seeing. 
The ubiquitous mouse 
In a 2009 report, the Nielson Company3 calculated that children aged 2–5 watch more 
than 32 hours of television each week, while the 6–11-year-olds watch slightly less. These 
ﬁgures include what they call time-shifted programming (broadcasts recorded to be viewed 
at another time) and digital video. Roberts and Foehr (2004: 324) found that 4-year-olds 
spent about 60 percent of their total media time (which includes everything from video 
games to reading) in front of television or movie screens. With the rapid increased 
exposure to additional types of digital media, these numbers jumped signiﬁcantly between 
Roberts and Foehr’s (2004) and Robert’s (2008) reports. 
In the present day, safeguards have been put in place to protect the youngest and most 
vulnerable from unhealthy or dangerous everyday items such as toys, food, and clothing. 
The broadcast entertainment industry is subject to the same kind of inspection, but in a 
way that is far less consistent. Some producers of child-focused materials have an extra-
ordinary amount of unquestioned access to children, and relatively little or perfunctory 
oversight. Disney is probably the most prominent of the companies who rely on reputation 
and nostalgia to deliver a message.4 It is also true that a great deal of overtly discriminatory

material has come out of all the animation studios from the earliest days of the industry. 
There is a large body of animated short ﬁlms or cartoons that denigrate, trivialize or mock 
the mentally ill, the handicapped, Native Americans, African Americans, Africans, Asians, 
Middle Easterners, Eskimos, Italians, Latinos, Jews, the English, Irish, Scots, Russians 
and just about every other nationality and ethnicity. 
Disney is the focus here because it holds such a large share of the market; for example, 
among its holdings are ﬁve ﬁlm studios in addition to a majority share in twenty different 
television stations (Giroux and Pollock 2010: 285). 
There is another kind of authority that Disney has claimed for itself that is rarely 
acknowledged or questioned. That is, Disney has systematically appropriated traditional 
stories and retold them in ways that isolate and exclude other storytellers and cultures. 
Zipes refers to this as the Disney Spell: 
It was not once upon a time, but at a certain time in history, before anyone knew what 
was happening, that Walt Disney cast a spell on the fairy tale, and he has held it captive 
ever since . . . [He] used his own “American” grit and ingenuity to appropriate 
European fairy tales [so that] his signature has obfuscated the names of Charles 
Perrault, the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, and Carlo Collodi. 
(Zipes 1995) 
In my own experiences teaching Disney ﬁlm I have come across students who are under 
the impression that Beauty and the Beast was conceived and written in 1990 speciﬁcally to 
be animated in the Disney studios. They are surprised and sometimes unsettled to learn 
that the story was originally titled La Belle et la Bête (ﬁrst published in France – in French 
– in 1740). At various points I have had students who assumed that The Legend of Sleepy 
Hollow (Irving 1819) and Winnie the Pooh (Milne 1926)5 originated with and belong to 
Disney. 
Stories are retold, by everyone, again and again; in this, Disney has not broken any 
sacred ground. The problem is that Disney appropriates and reinterprets stories and 
legends with significant meaning and importance to specific cultures without acknow-
ledging what they are doing. This habit of appropriating cultural icons is not limited to 
English language stories; for example, the Chinese have expressed dismay over Disney’s 
appropriation and remodeling of one of China’s most beloved legends in Mulan (Dong 
2010). Disney’s versions are often the first and sometimes the only versions children 
see and hear. And because the sociocultural values are consistent from ﬁlm to ﬁlm, the 
cumulative effect is considerable. 
The film that has garnered the most severe criticism in this regard is Pocahontas 
(Buescher and Ono 1996; Dundes 2001; Edgerton and Jackson 1996; Jhappan and Stasiulis 
2005; Ono and Buescher 1996, 2001). Some have condemned Disney’s version of this ﬁlm: 
“Disney commodiﬁes the past into digestible bits of information for the U.S. palate . . .  
Indeed, Pocahontas transforms an historical abomination into kid’s candy – genocide into 
a contemporary romance” (Ono and Buescher 2001: 35). 
Others are simply dissatisﬁed with the historical inaccuracies, but even those who take 
note will often just shrug, as in the Globe and Mail’s (1994) review of a live-action Disney 
ﬁlm Squanto. The reviewer acknowledges the liberties Disney took but notes that “history 
is written by the winners, and you can’t get much more victorious than Daddy Disney” 
(5 November 1994, as cited in Schaffer 1996). There is often debate and difference of 
opinion about Disney’s portrayal of American Indian history. In the case of Pocahontas,

TEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO DISCRIMINATE 
while most were critical of the ﬁlm, there were a few who thought it showed positive and 
forward movement in the way native cultures are portrayed. These contrasting views play 
out both inside and outside Native American circles.6 
The fact that children are exposed to broadcast media of all kinds on a regular, 
systematic basis has been established. Now the question must be: so what? Little kids – so 
this argument goes – don’t really pay much attention to details, there’s so much going on. 
They couldn’t possibly be taking notes from Bugs Bunny or King Louie on how to be 
prejudiced. But children – even very young children – are tireless observers of human 
behavior, and research indicates that they do indeed take in what they see and put it 
to use. 
Language acquisition is part and parcel of cognitive development more generally. While 
one part of the 4-year-old’s mind is sorting through strategies for passive constructions, 
another is working on categorization and category awareness. Categorization is a universal 
cognitive strategy, a tool humans use to cope with the complexity of the world. It is also 
the very cornerstone of stereotype and following from that, prejudice (Brown 2010). Some 
aspects of learning to differentiate and categorize are not well understood, but it is clear 
that children use similarity in this process. Furry creatures with four legs – dogs, goats, 
horses – are all doggies or waggies or something similar to 2-year-olds. By age 4, the same 
child can identify a dog reliably. The important thing to note here is that children see 
patterns in the data the world presents on a day-to-day basis, and those patterns are put 
to use. 
That is, children are not passive vessels who sit in front of the television and let stories 
ﬂoat by them. What they take in is processed and added to the store of data on how things 
– and people – are categorized. Children absorb things both abstract and concrete. Rice 
and Woodsmall (1988) conducted an experiment in which 3- and 5-year-olds were shown 
two 6-minute animated television programs. Included were twenty words which were not 
known to the children prior to the viewing, in normal conversational context. After a single 
viewing of the two clips, 3-year-olds gained an average of 1.56 new words, while 5-year-
olds retained 4.87 new words. 
Now given this general and vastly simplified information about children, language, 
cognition, and identity, consider the fact that by age 4, some children begin to exhibit 
prejudicial attitudes (Persson and Musher-Eizenman 2003: 531). In fact, numerous studies 
indicate that preschool children not only categorize by race, they also demonstrate bias 
(Aboud 2003, 2005; Katz 2003). Working with children between the ages 3 and 5 in a 
racially and ethnically diverse day care center, Van Ausdale and Feagin (2001) found that 
the children used racial categories to identify themselves and others in conversation, to 
include or exclude others from activities, and to “negotiate power in their own social/play 
networks.” 
The use and manipulation of language variation to establish character are long-
established practices in storytelling; Disney is by no means the ﬁrst or only practitioner. 
Long before Disney came on the scene, stage actors used language accent to draw character 
quickly, building on well-established, preconceived notions associated with specific 
regional loyalties, ethnic, racial alliances or economic status. This shortcut to charac-
terization means that certain traits need not be laboriously demonstrated by means of a 
character’s history and actions and an examination of motive. The blatant use of stereotype 
in any kind of storytelling (print, small or large screen, stage) may sometimes be used for 
satirical effect, but more usually stereotypes indicate lack of imagination, laziness, bias, or 
some combination of the three.

However, the issue here is not the quality of the storytelling; more important is the way 
storytelling behaviors and reactions reﬂect deeper beliefs and opinions. As we will see, 
stereotypes do not have to be overtly negative to be problematic and limiting. 
The wolf’s backstory 
In 1933, while the U.S. was in the depths of a severe depression, Walt Disney’s animators 
created a short cartoon which would make an $88,000 proﬁt in the ﬁrst two years of its 
release (Grant 1993: 56). By 1930 there were some 20,000 motion-picture theaters in 
business, serving 90 million customers weekly (Emery and Emery 1988: 265) and the price 
of admission was approximately 25 cents.7 Thus Disney’s animated The Three Little Pigs, 
a familiar story with a message of hard work in the face of adversity, was widely seen from 
the early days of entertainment ﬁlm. The theme of good triumphing over evil was clearly 
a timely and popular one, and one that has not gone out of favor: Disney’s The Three Little 
Pigs is still shown with regularity, in part or whole, on Disney’s cable television channels. 
It has also been released numerous times on video, laserdisc, and DVD, in at least four 
distinct editions. 
One of the topics which is often discussed in relation to this particular Disney animated 
short is a scene included in the original release, in which the wolf – in yet another attempt 
to trick the pigs into opening the door to him – dresses as a Jewish peddler (Grant 1993; 
Kaufman 1988; Precker 1993a). Kaufman interprets this in a way that is deferential to 
Disney: 
Ethnic stereotypes were, of course, not uncommon in ﬁlms of the early Thirties, and 
were usually essayed in a free-wheeling spirit of fun, with no malice intended. By the 
time the ﬁlm was reissued in 1948 . . . social attitudes had changed considerably. 
(Kaufman 1988) 
Kaufman’s claim that such stereotypes came across as fun and free-wheeling with no malice 
intended cannot be taken at face value and must be examined more closely. It serves as an 
excellent example of the general inclination to isolate Disney from critical commentary. 
Disney’s caricature of a Jewish peddler stands out for the way it mirrors the anti-Semitic 
propaganda coming out of Germany in the same time period. Disney would not allow a 
screenshot of the original animation of the wolf as Jewish peddler to appear in this book 
(or anywhere else, for that matter). This refusal to allow reproduction of the image protects 
their corporate image, but it also stiﬂes discussion about the role of animated ﬁlm in the 
socialization of children and the history of anti-Semitism in the U.S.8 
It is likely that many younger readers are not familiar with the visual stereotypes that 
were so common prior to World War II. These images include features which are visual 
shorthand for Jew, a context that is provided by the poster in Figure 7.1. The poster was 
designed to advertise an exhibition called The Eternal Jew (Der ewige Jude) in Germany in 
the late 1930s (Hippler et al. 1940, directors). 
The similarities between the Disney version of the Big Bad Wolf as Jewish peddler and 
the Nazi propaganda are more than simply striking. Both images have large hook noses, 
straggly beards and wear side locks; both wear long black coats and a dark hat similar to 
those worn by some Orthodox Jews; both hold out a palm full of coins, a common way to 
invoke the stereotype of Jews as unscrupulous and greedy moneylenders. We know that,

Figure 7.1 The Eternal Jew

because all of these virulent anti-Semitic statements were published openly in the “The 
Eternal Jew” exhibit itself, and also in the ﬁlm based on the exhibition. This text which 
accompanied one set of still shots from the ﬁlm provides a representative sample: “While 
millions of long-established native Germans were propelled into unemployment and 
misery, immigrant Jews achieved fantastic wealth within a few years. Not by means of 
honest work, but rather through usury, swindling, and fraud” (Hippler 1940: translated 
from the original German by this author).

107 
There is no direct evidence that the Disney animators and ﬁlm makers shared in any 
of these beliefs, but still it is not possible to overlook the similarities of the images 
produced.9 Kaufman (1988) recounts that the anti-Semitic depiction of the wolf as a Jewish 
peddler remained intact until The Three Little Pigs was re-released in 1948, 14 years later. 
At that time the Jewish peddler was replaced with an all-around rough guy, and then only 
because of pressure from the Hays Ofﬁce, which brought the issue of Jewish sensibilities 
and the Holocaust to Disney’s attention.10 Grant (1993: 54) reports that Disney later 
admitted that the original scene was in bad taste.11 
In addition to the visual clues, the actor who supplied the voice for the wolf used a 
distinctive Yiddish accent to make the stereotype complete.12 That is, while Disney did 
change the animation in 1948, the peddler’s Yiddish accent was left intact for much longer. 
At an unspeciﬁed date the segment was ﬁnally revoiced: “[I]n case the Yiddish dialect of 
the original scene might itself be found offensive, the dialogue was changed as well. Now 
the Wolf spoke in a standard ‘dumb’ cartoon voice” (Kaufman 1988: 43–44). This means 
that even after that part of The Three Little Pigs was reanimated to remove the offensive 
stereotyped image, the wolf continued to speak with a Yiddish accent. Thus the underlying 
message rooted in anti-Semitism and fear of the other was maintained, establishing a link 
between the evil intentions of the wolf and Jewish identity. Grant also relates that the 
newer animation and dialogue still leaned on more general stereotypes and fears, in that 
the “disguised wolf no longer has Hebraic tones or mannerisms, instead saying: “I’m the 
Fuller brush-man. I workin’ me way through college” (Grant 1993: 54). 
Grant and Kaufman both claim that the original image of the Wolf-as-Jewish-Peddler 
had been edited out upon urging of the Hays Ofﬁce. In 1997, I bought a VHS tape of 
three classic Disney cartoons from an ofﬁcial Disney store, however, and found, to my 
surprise and disquiet, that the original animation of the Wolf with a yarmulke and side 
locks, large nose and peddler’s pack was intact. How – and why – this release of the cartoon 
came to include this particular redacted scene is unclear. 
In 1992, a similar controversy would arise over the portrayal of characters in Disney’s 
Aladdin, a movie set in an imaginary, long ago Arabic kingdom. An offending line of 
dialogue in an opening song “Where they cut off your ear if they don’t like your face/It’s 
barbaric, but hey, it’s home” was partially changed in response to complaints from the 
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (AAADC), but as the representative of 
the AAADC pointed out, the accents of the characters remained as originally ﬁlmed: 
[They] particularly objected to the fact that the good guys – Aladdin, Princess Jasmine 
and her father – talk like Americans, while all the other Arab characters have heavy 
accents. This pounds home the message that people with a foreign accent are bad. 
(Precker 1993b) 
Talking the talk 
Any actor necessarily brings to a role his or her own native language. In many cases, the 
variety of English (we are still focused here on ﬁlm and theater in the United States) is 
irrelevant to the characterization and can be left alone. Some actors are infamous for never 
trying to portray an accent other than their own, regardless of the nature of the story or 
the character. Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Ricky Gervais, Diane Keaton all made or make 
public statements about their unwillingness to attempt an accent other than their own.

TEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO DISCRIMINATE 
More often, however, the director and actor, working together, will target a particular 
social, regional or L2 accent, perhaps because it is intrinsic to the role and cannot be 
sacriﬁced. U.S. audiences may or may not suspend disbelief when Robin Hood sounds 
like he grew up in Nevada, but it would be harder to cast someone with an upper-class 
British accent as Ronald Regan or Richard Nixon and not do serious harm to credibility, 
audience expectations and reception. 
In a similar way, non-native speakers of English who come to the U.S. to be actors bring 
their L2 accents to their work. This accent may restrict the roles they can play, or they 
may have roles written or rewritten to suit the immutable nature of their accents (Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Djimon Hounsou, Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, Chow Yun-Fat, 
Marion Cotillard, Benecio del Toro, and Juliette Binoche provide examples). American 
actors may undergo accent training of various kinds in an attempt to learn to imitate what 
they need for a particular role, although there are many examples where this effort fails 
despite expensive and careful tutoring, even in the limited way it is asked of them during 
ﬁlming. 
What is particularly relevant and interesting in this context, however, is the way that 
actors attempt to manipulate language as a tool in the construction of character, sometimes 
successfully, sometimes not. Educational programs for the training of actors for stage and 
screen often include classes on speech, dialogue, and the contrivance of accent. Simply 
put, with a lot of hard work and good editing it may be possible to fool some of the people, 
some of the time. 
The materials used in actor-oriented accent courses are interesting in and of themselves, 
because the approach often includes not just the mechanics and technicalities of one 
particular regional or foreign accent, but also issues of content and approach. 
Dialect actors must avoid going so far with certain speech traits that they end up 
creating ethnic or linguistic stereotypes . . . language or dialect background does not 
dictate character actions. Characters with accents must have the same range of choices 
available to them as characters whose speech is identical to yours. 
(Karshner and Stern 1990: Preface) 
This is an enlightened and realistic position, certainly. Other materials prepared for actors 
are not always so even-handed, as seen in Foreign Dialects: A Manual for Actors, Directors 
and Writers (Herman and Herman 1943 [1997]). The pointers on how to imitate one 
particular national dialect (an abstraction in itself) are chock full of stereotypes. The 1997 
edition has been stripped of the worst passages but some stereotypes remain, such as the 
advice on how to talk like an Irishman: “The pace is a bit faster than American but this is 
because of the Irishman’s ability to voice his thoughts quickly and easily and also because 
of his habit of falling back on verbal clichés and other hackneyed expressions” (Herman 
1997: 67). 
Of course, a person using Herman’s book to learn a particular accent for a particular 
role on stage or screen would not necessarily buy into Herman’s characterizations of whole 
nations. But it’s not adult viewers at the center of this discussion; we are looking at 
entertainment media and the way children are bombarded with stereotypes. 
In a ﬁlm set in a country where English is not spoken, the writers and director have 
to come to an initial decision: they could hire actors who are native speakers of the 
language that is spoken in that setting and use subtitles; they could have the dialogue 
spoken in English, each actor using his or her native variety and simply abstracting away

----- Page 134 (native) -----
TEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO DISCRIMINATE

from the question of logical language spoken; or the more common approach, at least in 
recent times: Native English-speaking actors speak English, but sometimes take on the 
accent of the language they would logically be speaking in the time and setting of the 
story. 
If a French accent is meant to remind viewers that the story is taking place in France, 
then logic would require that all the characters in that story speak with a French accent. 
But this is not the case in animated or live action; for the most part, in movies set outside 
English-speaking countries only a few actors will contrive the accent of that country. The 
decision about which actors will try to sound French, for example, is not random, but 
follows logically from the dominant stereotypes (or in some cases, from the actor’s native 
language). Consider Disney’s Beauty and the Beast (Trousdale and Wise 1991, directors) 
set in France (Table 7.1). All of the major characters speak English with American accents 
with three exceptions: the sexy chamber maid, the amorous butler, and a temperamental 
cook are voiced by actors contriving French accents. 
The exact opposite approach was taken with The Hunchback of Notre Dame, also set in 
France; in this case, there were no French accents used, but those voice actors who were 
portraying the dark-skinned Romani took on inconsistent and unidentiﬁable L2 features. 
A ﬁnal consideration that is very relevant to analysis of language manipulation in these 
ﬁlms has to do with a new direction in casting that began in the 1960s with the production 
of The Jungle Book. This was the ﬁrst animated feature in which voice actors were cast on 
the basis of public recognition and popularity. Actors and musicians who had already 
established a personality and reputation with the movie-going public were drawn, quite 
literally, into the animation and story-telling process so that the relationship between 
voice, popularity, language and characterization in Disney ﬁlm entered a new era. This 
strategy was not greeted with enthusiasm by all ﬁlm critics: 
[B]reathing heart and soul into a ﬁlm is not so easily accomplished. The Jungle Book 
lacked this quality, and substituted for it a gallery of characters whose strongest 
identity was with the stars who provided their voices. The animators enjoyed working 
with people like George Sanders, Louis Prima, and Phil Harris, and incorporated 
elements of their personalities into the animated characters. Audiences naturally 
responded, so the animators felt justified in continuing this practice. “It is much 
simpler and more realistic than creating a character and then searching for the right 
voice,” [producer] Reitherman contended. 
(Maltin 1987: 74–75) 
The issue of recognizable voice actors will be relevant in the discussion of AAVE language 
features in speciﬁc ﬁlms.

TEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO DISCRIMINATE 
Time and place 
Disney’s animated ﬁlms are set in a wide range of places and time periods (Table 7.2). It 
must be noted that in some cases Disney seems unconcerned with the setting and time 
and simply puts modern-day people and sensibilities in exotic places. Tarzan takes place 
in the Victorian era, somewhere on the African continent – which we must take on faith, 
as there are no local (African) humanoids in speaking roles. The Lion King is set in Africa, 
but again the story does not involve human beings; here we know it is Africa because the 
writers go out of their way to remind the audience. The Jungle Book is set in India, with a 
single human character – Mowgli – to establish that this story is set somewhere else. In 
extreme cases the film makers seem to want to draw on the atmosphere and cultural 
awareness associated with speciﬁc times and places, but the more pressing concern is how 
to engage the interest of the viewers by making the setting familiar and comfortable. 
In all of these movies, the logical setting dictates a particular language or set of lan-
guages, but there is no attempt to try to build those social behaviors into the story. It makes 
a certain amount of sense to set aside issues of logical language use and simply tell the 
story in English, especially if the audience is very young. However, in most cases the 
directors or actors continue to draw on language-focused social differences to establish 
character. A case in point here is Tarzan’s best friend, another smart-aleck sidekick with 
a strong Brooklyn accent (voiced by Rosie O’Donnell). 
The Emperor’s New Groove (Dindal 2000, director) is probably the most extreme case of 
a disconnect between the proposed time and place and the way the story is told. Groove is 
set in Incan Peru, a fact that is never explicitly named or identified in the film itself 
(Silverman 2002), but was spoken about freely when the creative staff were interviewed. 
Animators and producers talked at length about research into Incan culture and the fact 
that they went through many centuries of archeological artifacts to find those which 
appealed to them as supportive of a light-hearted, comedic plot. Silverman, an archeolo-
gist, estimates that as it is presented the ﬁlm contains elements that span 3,000 years and 
275,000 square kilometers of space (ibid.: 309). As a result, “In Disney’s hands, Groove so 
signiﬁcantly departs and appropriates from the archaeologically known Inca Empire and 
other pre-Columbian civilizations of ancient Peru, that it is a textbook example of 
hyperreality and simulacra.” The terms hyperreality and simulacra are often used in media 
studies; simulacra are copies of an original that no longer exists, or as in this case, that 
never existed to begin with. That is, Disney’s ancient Peru looks as though it is meant to 
be a copy of the original, but in fact is created out of whole cloth. Baudrillard (1994: 1) 
calls this hyperreality, or a map that precedes the territory it supposedly describes.

It could be argued that Groove is simply a well-intentioned but failed attempt to 
represent Incan culture. Images and icons might be seen as nothing more than an attempt 
to establish an unusual and exotic setting. In fact, the feel of the ﬁlm is distinctly present-
day U.S. in narrative strategy, social conventions, humor, and language. 
This is a case where all voice actors use their own varieties of English. There are no 
attempts at an accent that would evoke Incan culture, because the story, in reality, has 
nothing to do with that time and place. The goal seems to be to evoke other cultures only 
in so far as they will mesh with the expectations of an American audience. This is done by 
assimilation and objectification, and the result is children’s film which strips an entire 
culture of its history and trivializes what is left behind. And accomplishes all this in some 
90 minutes. 
The unfortunate result of all this is that the majority of children who see this movie – 
many more than once – will retain Disney’s version of Incan culture because it is the only 
version they will ever be exposed to. Few American students will have an opportunity to 
learn in more detail about the more complex – and interesting – history of the Incan 
people. 
Animated ﬁlms offer a unique way to study how a dominant culture reafﬁrms its control 
over subordinate cultures and nations by re-establishing, on a day-to-day basis, their pre-
ferred view of the world as right and proper and primary. Precisely because of animation’s 
(assumed) innocence and innocuousness, the ﬁlm makers have a broader spectrum of tools 
available to them and a great deal more leeway: 
As non-photographic application of photographic medium, [animators] are freed from 
the basic cinematic expectation that they convey an “impression of reality” . . . The 
function and essence of cartoons is in fact the reverse: the impression of reality, of 
intangible and imaginary worlds in chaotic, disruptive, subversive collision. 
(Burton 1992: 23–24) 
A study of accents in animated cartoons over time reveals the way linguistic stereotypes 
mirror the evolution of national fears: Japanese and German characters in cartoons during 
World War II, Russian spy characters in children’s cartoons in the 1950s and 1960s 
(Natasha and Boris meet Rocky and Bullwinkle), Middle Eastern characters in the era of 
hostilities with Iran and Iraq. All of this in addition to long-standing prejudices against 
people of color and minority religious groups. 
In the following discussion of systematic patterns found in a deﬁned body of children’s 
animated ﬁlm, the hypothesis is a simple one: animated ﬁlms entertain, but they are also 
a vehicle by which children learn to associate speciﬁc characteristics and life styles with 
speciﬁc social groups, and to accept a narrow and exclusionary world view. In fact, they 
are particularly adept at this precisely because they do entertain, an irony that might be 
called A Spoonful of Sugar.13 
Disney feature films 
A large-scale study was carried out for the ﬁrst edition of this book, in which 371 char-
acters in 24 full-length animated Disney ﬁlms were analyzed. The 24 ﬁlms represented 
everything available at that time on VHS (DVD technology was not yet commonly 
available). For this second, revised edition, an additional 14 films were watched and

----- Page 137 (native) -----

analyzed (Table 7.3).14 To be included, a ﬁlm had to be: (1) fully animated – no live action; 
(2) full length (i.e., not a short ﬁlm or cartoon); and (3) produced by Disney. This last 
restriction excludes ﬁlms that were produced by Pixar but distributed by Disney, a step 
taken for the sake of consistency. 
Even a cursory look is enough to get a sense of the range of social and linguistic 
stereotypes Disney presents to young children repeatedly. Before the advent of the VCR, 
repeated viewings of Cinderella, for example, was simply not possible. Since the technology 
boom, however, Disney ﬁlms can be rented or purchased and watched over and over again, 
so that the messages and morals become deeply ingrained (Buescher and Ono 1996; 
Edgerton and Jackson 1996; Giroux and Pollock 2010; Lacroix 2004). With this comes 
the merchandising storm. In the months prior to the release of any full-length animated 
ﬁlm, Disney begins to release marketing tie-ins, which include “toys, apparel, accessories,

footwear, home furnishings, home décor, health, beauty, food, stationery and consumer 
electronics” (The Walt Disney Company Fact Book 2008, http://goo.gl/P9UrJ). 
Stereotypes (whether or not language and accent are manipulated) are not subtle, 
ranging from Lady and the Tramp’s cheerful, musical Italian chefs to Treasure of the Lost 
Lamp’s stingy, Scottish-accented McScrooge. In the post-1997 ﬁlms this trend continued; 
for example, Disney continues to portray side-kicks as scrappy inner city tough guys with 
hearts of gold. Consider the following: 
Bolt (Howard and Williams 2008, directors), in which the side-kick street-smart 
character is a cat voiced by Susie Essmann, a native of Brooklyn. 
Mulan (Bancroft and Cook 1998, directors) where the main character has a small, very 
scrappy guardian dragon called Mushu voiced by Eddie Murphy. The illogic of a 
sidekick who speaks twentieth-century AAVE in ancient China seems to have been 
secondary to the need for this particular character type. 
The Hunchback of Notre Dame’s (Trousdale and Wise 1996, directors) Quasimodo has 
only three friends, stone gargoyles (inanimate objects who become animated for him 
alone) two of which speak American English with distinctly urban accents (Hugo, 
voiced by Jason Alexander, and Laverne, by Mary Wickes). 
While Disney did not hesitate to include an AAVE-speaking sidekick in Mulan (set in 
ancient China), someone involved in the production of Brother Bear (Blaise and Walker 
2003, directors) balked at that particular jump in logic. Instead, the odd side-kick 
characters – two moose – speak with the caricatured Canadian accent made popular by 
the ﬁctional Great White North SCTV hosts Bob and Doug McKenzie (comedians Rick 
Moranis and Dave Thomas). Note also that in all of these cases, the characters who speak 
with stigmatized accents appear in animal or inanimate form, a pattern that will be seen 
elsewhere as well. 
Original study methodology 
This body of animated ﬁlms was chosen because the Disney Corporation is the largest 
producer of such ﬁlms, as seen in Figure 7.2. Together Disney and the rest of the Buena 
Vista empire15 produced about half of the one hundred top grossing animated films 
between 1980 and the present, which means that they took in about 6 trillion US dollars 
in that time period, for one set of ﬁlms only. Clearly Disney reaches many people, and a 
good proportion of them are children. This would be reason enough to study their ﬁlms, 
but they are also the most highly marketed and advertised of the ﬁeld. 
The movies listed under the label 1997 in Table 7.3 were analyzed by a group of 
advanced graduate students and myself. In that process, each character was coded for a 
variety of language and characterization variables. The detailed linguistic description for 
each character consisted of a mix of phonetic transcription, quotes of typical syntactic 
structures, and marked lexical items. 
In cases where an actor is clearly contriving an accent, a decision was made as to what 
language variety was most likely intended to be portrayed. For example, a poorly executed 
British accent was still counted as such for the creators and (most) viewers. In Aladdin, one 
of the minor characters, a thief, speaks primarily Midwestern or West Coast American 
English, but also has some trilled r sounds – deﬁnitely not a feature generally associated

with American English. This particular character’s accent was still classified as *SAE, 
however, since only one atypical feature appeared in his phonology. Another character 
whose speech exhibits features from two or more dialects is Cogsworth, the butler/ 
clock in Beauty and the Beast. He speaks with a contrived British accent in which some 
American features crop up unpredictably; thus, though it is not an accurate imitation 
of a middle- or upper-class British dialect, for the purposes of this study it is classiﬁed 
as such. 
Disney’s world 
Of the 371 characters with speaking roles in the 24 movies examined in 1997, 259 or 69.8 
percent are male (Figure 7.3). Female characters make up the other just over 30 percent. 
A look at the way female and male characters are deployed, overall, indicates that within 
the proportions established, they are equally distributed as major and minor characters. 
Female characters are rarely seen at work outside the home and family; where they do 
show up, they are mothers and princesses, devoted or (rarely) rebellious daughters. When 
they are at work, female characters are waitresses, nurses, nannies, or housekeepers. Men, 
conversely, are doctors, waiters, advisors to kings, thieves, hunters, servants, detectives, 
and pilots. The situation is roughly the same in the newer ﬁlms added to the analysis (but 
see the discussion of The Princess and the Frog). 
The universe displayed to young children in these films is one with a clear division 
between the sexes in terms of life style and life choices. Traditional views of the woman’s

TEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO DISCRIMINATE 
115 
Figure 7.3 371 animated characters by language spoken 
role in the family are strongly underwritten, and in Disney ﬁlms, from Snow White to Meet 
the Robinsons, the female characters see, or come to accept, their ﬁrst and most important 
role in life as that of wife and mother. What does an examination of language use have to 
add to this observation? What do characters, male and female speak? 
For the most part (43.1 percent) they speak something approximating *SAE. Another 
13.9 percent speak varieties of U.S. English which are associated with particular geographic 
area, racial, ethnic or economic groups. Less stigmatized varieties of British English are 
spoken by 21.8 percent. 
While 91 of the total 371 characters occur in roles where they would not logically be 
speaking English, there are only 34 characters who speak English with a foreign accent. 
The tendency to use foreign accents to convey the setting of the story is conﬁrmed by 
these distributions; there are twice as many characters with foreign-accented English in 
stories set in places like France and Italy. 
Of particular interest are the two movies set in Africa, Tarzan (Buck and Lima 1999, 
directors) and The Lion King. It is not unreasonable to assume that for stories set in Africa 
the logical language would not be English. There is no acknowledgement of this fact in 
Tarzan, but some of the characters in The Lion King are derived from Swahili. The good-
natured but dumb warthog is called Pumbaa, or simpleton; Shenzi, the name of the leader 
of the hyena pack, means uncouth. 
However, the only character who actually uses traces of Swahili and a contrived Swahili 
accent is Raﬁki (Swahili for friend), the wise and eccentric baboon who fulﬁlls the role of 
spiritual guide. Why there are not more characters in these settings who speak with an 
accent is a logical question, and one which will be addressed below. 
Some 90 percent of all the characters speak English natively, with an American or British 
English or Australian accent. However, a closer look (Figure 7.3) makes it clear that

----- Page 141 (native) -----
116 
TEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO DISCRIMINATE 
60 percent of all the characters appear in stories set in English-speaking countries; 
thus, a signiﬁcant number of English-speaking characters appear in stories set outside the 
U.S. 
Sometimes these are Americans abroad, as was the case in Treasure of the Lost Lamp; 
sometimes these are characters who are not logically English-speaking, given their role 
and the story, as is the case for all the characters in Aladdin. Here three language settings 
are considered: stories set in English-speaking lands, those set in non-English-speaking 
countries, and ﬁnally, those set in mythical kingdoms where it would be difﬁcult to make 
an argument for one language or another as primary (The Little Mermaid, for example, 
seems to take place in a Caribbean setting) (Figure 7.4). 
Since a contrived foreign accent is often used to signal that the typical or logical 
language of the setting would not be English, it is not surprising to see that the highest 
percentage of characters with foreign-accented English occur in the second type of 
language setting. But it is also signiﬁcant that even more characters with foreign accents 
appear in stories set in the U.S. and England (Figure 7.5). 
The breakdown of characters by their language variety (Figure 7.4) becomes interesting 
when we examine that variety in relationship to the motivations and actions of the 
character’s role. Disney ﬁlms rely heavily on traditional themes of good and evil, and with 
very few exceptions they depend also on happy endings. Characters with unambiguously 
positive roles (185 of them) constitute 49.9 percent; those who are clearly bad or even evil, 
only 19.4 percent. The remainder is divided between characters who change signiﬁcantly 
in the course of the story (always from bad to good) and those characters whose roles are 
too small and ﬂeeting to make such a judgment (86, or 23.2 percent of the total).

Figure 7.5 Character distribution by story setting 
Further, female characters are more likely to show positive motivations and actions 
(Figure 7.6). Unlike male characters who sometimes are bad and then become good, bad 
females show no character development. At this point it seems that there is no relationship 
between non-native English accents and the portrayal of good and evil. 
There are 72 characters who are truly bad, in major and minor roles. They include the 
poacher and would-be child-murderer Percival McLeach in Rescuers Down Under with his 
contrived Southwestern accent and idiom (“purty feather, boy!” “I whupped ya’ll!” “Home, 
home on the range, where the critters ’r ta-id up in chains”), and the whip-and-cleaver-
wielding Stromboli of Pinocchio, with his threats of dismemberment, incredible rages, and 
florid, contrived Italian accent. Of these evil 72, however, a full 85 percent are native 
speakers of English; almost half are speakers of U.S. English. Bad guys with foreign accents 
account for only 15 percent of the whole (Figure 7.7 and Table 7.4). 
Taken in context, however, this impression cannot stand firm. In Figure 7.8, which 
compares positive, negative and mixed motivations (the marginal characters have been 
removed for the sake of this discussion) by major language groups, it becomes clear the 
overall representation of persons with foreign accents is far more negative than that of 
speakers of U.S. or British English. About 20 percent of U.S. English speakers are bad 
characters, while about 40 percent of non-native speakers of English are evil. 
Additional interesting patterns come forward when we examine the representation of 
speciﬁc languages linked to national origin, race, or characterization.

Getting the hang of Technicolor 
Race and ethnicity are particularly sensitive issues in all Disney animated films. The 
company has repeatedly and soundly offended different segments of the population, but 
the most glaring missteps have to do with the representation of African Americans and 
people of color more generally. Examples include irresponsible Latinos and gregarious 
Italians (Lady and the Tramp, Oliver and Company, The Lion King), nefarious Asians (Lady 
and Tramp, Mulan, The Aristocats), smart-mouthed, lazy, disrespectful African Americans 
(Dumbo, The Lion King, Song of the South, The Princess and the Frog, The Little Mermaid), 
and savage Native Americans (Peter Pan, Pocahontas). 
Table 7.5 is an attempt to draw together all characters from the animated ﬁlms who 
fulﬁll one or more of the following categories: 
The voice actor is African American.  
The voice actor was most likely cast on the basis of voice recognition, regardless of  
race.  
The animated character is Black either in actuality or symbolically.  
The animated character speaks English with some degree of AAVE inﬂection or other  
salient markers (that is, the character’s English would be heard as African American  
in origin).

TEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO DISCRIMINATE 
The ability to identify an individual’s race or ethnicity on the basis of voice alone is a 
phenomenon that has been referred to as linguistic proﬁling, a topic that will be taken up 
in more detail in the discussion of discrimination in the housing market. 
Baugh’s work on linguistic proﬁling and the role of vowel shapes, intonation, timing 
and voice quality in social and racial identiﬁcation becomes potentially relevant in this 
context (Thomas and Reaser 2004). Unfortunately, no studies have been done, to date, of 
the way linguistic proﬁling might work in an entertainment setting such as animated ﬁlms. 
It needs to be stated quite clearly that this discussion does not include the sum total of 
all African American actors who have ever had speaking roles in Disney animated ﬁlm. 
For example, a thorough examination would require close study of The Song of the South, 
which Disney has yet to release on VHS tape or DVD for reasons that may or may not 
have to do with concerns about image and racism. 
The most ideology-laden of the ﬁlms examined here is probably the Lion King, which 
fulﬁlls all four of criteria listed above. The Lion King is set in Africa, which may be the 
reason why many of the voice actors were African American. Of the three major roles, two 
of the voice actors are Anglo (Simba and Scar, his uncle), and one is African American 
(Mufasa). Mufasa is voiced by the immediately recognizable James Earl Jones; Mufasa’s 
evil brother Scar is voiced in an exaggerated and distinctly effeminate British English 
(Jeremy Irons). This falls into a well-established practice of rendering evil geniuses as Brits 
(see, for example, Aladdin and Bolt), but it also portrays homosexuality as evil, untrust-
worthy, and inauthentic. Scar is also the only lion with a black mane. 
But it is the casting of the primary character – Simba – which stands out. As cub and as 
an adult lion, Simba is voiced by Anglos. That is, the prince, the son of African Americans, 
is white, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the critics and scholars who consider race and 
ethnicity (Benshoff and Grifﬁn 2009; Martin-Rodriguez 2000; Sun 2008; Walker 1994),16 
gender issues, sexuality and sexism (Benshoff and Grifﬁn 2009: “Case study: The Lion 
King”) or class, power and hegemony (Gooding 1995; Morton 1996; Sun 2008). 
What the directors and producers were thinking when they cast the voice actors cannot 
be known; if notes on this process exist, they are not available to researchers, nor do the 
producers respond to requests for interviews. Nor is there any way to know which voice 
actors were considered for the role of Simba, whether young African American actors were 
considered and auditioned, or if the entire pool of candidates was Anglo. It is unfortunate 
that so much of the process remains out of the public eye, as that information would 
provide invaluable insights. 
More subtle is stratiﬁcation of characters voiced by actors who are recognizably African 
American. James Earl Jones (Mufasa) has a deep and commanding voice without AAVE 
intonation or grammatical structure; Whoopi Goldberg shifts in and out of AAVE as the 
leader of the pack of hyenas who do Scar’s bidding. Thus the message is a familiar one: 
AAVE speakers occupy the dark and frightening places, where Simba does not belong 
and should not be; he belongs on the sunny savannah where *SAE speakers like his father 
live. 
The three primary hyenas who threaten Simba are composed of the AAVE-speaking 
Shenzi, Ed, a hyena who slobbers and grunts without any language, and Banzai, voiced by 
Cheech Martin. Martin shifts in and out of Latino-accented English, throwing in Spanish 
at one point (¿que pasa?) to make sure there is no mistake about his ethnicity. 
At the same time, none of the characters, whether they speak *SAE or AAVE, show any 
clear connection to things African with the exception of the wise baboon, Rafiki, who 
occupies a special but peripheral role in the ﬁlm’s story.

TEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO DISCRIMINATE

Other types of entertainment media use these same strategies, of course, as bell hooks 
has observed: 
[It is the] current trend in producing colorful ethnicity for the white consumer 
appetite that makes it possible for blackness to be commodified in unprecedented 
ways, and for whites to appropriate black culture without interrogating whiteness or 
showing concern for the displeasure of blacks . . . white cultural imperialism . . . allows 
white audiences to applaud representations of black culture, if they are satisﬁed with 
the images and habits of being represented. 
(hooks 1996: 223) 
The role of King Louie – an orangutan – in The Jungle Book provides an example of another 
kind of stereotype: the African American entertainer, the jokester or trickster. Louis Prima, 
who voiced the role of King Louie, was an Italian American who grew up in New Orleans 
in the early twentieth century and spent a lot of time with the blues and jazz musicians, 
primarily African Americans, in the French Quarter. Given his musical training, back-
ground and reputation for scat singing, it’s not surprising that movie viewers generally 
believe that King Louie is voiced by an African American. This might be seen as a fairly 
neutral case of linguistic proﬁling. 
Much has been made of King Louie and his manipulation of Mowgli, the only human 
being in this story. He convinces Mowgli and the audience that he has one goal in life, 
and that is to be the one thing he is not: a human being, a man. African American males 
who are not linguistically assimilated to the sociolinguistic norms of a middle and colorless 
United States are allowed very few possibilities in life, but they are allowed to want those 
things they do not have and cannot be. 
Other infamous stereotypes occur in Dumbo (the shiftless, aimless but friendly crows 
who advise Dumbo speak and sing AAVE – one of them is called Jim Crow); and The Fox 
and the Hound where the protective and wise Big Mama is voiced by Pearl Bailey. 
While in the first study 161 *SAE speakers appear in proportions of 43.1 percent 
humanoid, 54.4 percent animal and 2.5 percent inanimate creatures (such as the talking 
teapot in Beauty and the Beast), all AAVE-speaking characters appear in animal rather than 
humanoid form. Given the low overall number of AAVE speakers, however, it is hard to 
draw any inferences from that fact. The issue is further complicated in that every character 
with a Southern accent appears in animal rather than humanoid form as well. Further 
examination of unambiguously positive and negative characters indicates that a full 43.4 
percent of 90 characters in human form show negative actions and motivations while only 
18.6 percent of the 156 animal characters are negative. 
This correlation of African American to animal held true until Atlantis:The Lost Empire 
(Trousdale and Wise 2001, directors) and the character of Dr. Joshua Strongbear Sweet. 
Dr. Strongbear Sweet is presented in human form, clearly African American in appearance. 
Like Mufasa, Dry Strongbear Sweet doesn’t use AAVE features so that another correlation 
is maintained: powerful, educated = *SAE. 
Following Atlantis, Disney made some progress away from these stereotypes with Lilo 
& Stitch and the 2009 ﬁlm The Princess and the Frog. Lilo & Stitch stands apart for its sensitive 
portrayal of Hawai’i, Hawai’ian culture and people of color. The difference here had to 
do with the way the ﬁlm was made: Chris Sanders and Dean DeBois were given “near-
complete creative control as co-writers, storyboard artists and directors – a first for a 
Disney ﬁlm” (Davis 2002). Lilo, her older sister and her sister’s boyfriend have features

TEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO DISCRIMINATE 
that are not Anglicized, and their lives are neither romanticized nor trivialized; they all 
speak with Hawai’i Creole (HC) intonation and rhythms, and HC is heard now and then 
in the background. The one African American character is Cobra Bubbles, a social worker 
who looks a great deal like a professional weight lifter. His looks are frightening and his 
voice – distinctly African American – is imposing, but this character is in fact one of the 
good guys, sincere in his concern for the orphaned sisters. Unfortunately Disney did not 
repeat this unusual arrangement, and the usual style of production oversight was restored 
for The Princess and the Frog, 
The story is set in New Orleans in the 1920s, and features a young African-American 
woman as the main character, one who has both father and mother as the story opens.17 
The issue of language variety and accent was made somewhat easier for Disney because 
all the characters – humanoid and animal – speak a variety of English marked, at the very 
least, as Southern. It’s important to recognize that the film makers made an effort to 
acknowledge the wide variety of language and language varieties spoken in New Orleans 
and environs in that time period: beyond African American English, there are also speakers 
of Southern American English, Cajun and French Creole. How well they handled these 
various languages is a subject worthy of close examination, and cannot be undertaken here. 
The language of the main African American characters is only slightly distinct from 
that of their Anglo counterparts, in part because the voice actors restrict themselves to 
intonation patterns. There are no AAVE grammatical constructions or idioms that would 
make that Anglo/African American differences more distinct. One of the strongest speakers 
of AAVE – Tatiana’s father – dies before the story ever really starts. 
The issue of language variety is sidestepped in the case of the Prince, as well. The char-
acter, while charming and handsome, as are all the Disney princes, is also not American. 
Neither is he African American, nor is he Anglo. The voice actor is a native of Brazil, which 
freed the writers and directors of dealing with the issue of AAVE. Many critics and 
commentators took note of this equivocation, pointing out that by turning both prince and 
princess into frogs, the issue of color could be set aside. Some see this as a maneuver by 
Disney to anticipate and nullify the potentially explosive topic of miscegenation (Gehlawat 
2010: 424). Others took a more sarcastic tone: “They say it ain’t easy bein’ green, but it’s 
certainly a hell of a lot easier than being black” (Foundas 2009). Commentary on the web 
was often emotional and angry, as was the case on Black Voices, an AOL discussion forum 
where commentators faulted the prince’s light skin color. Commentator Angela Bronner 
Helm wrote: “Disney obviously doesn’t think a black man is worthy of the title of prince. 
His hair and features are decidedly non-black. This has left many in the community shaking 
their head[s] in befuddlement and even rage” (as quoted in Barnes 2009). 
Lovers and mothers 
Romance is a major plot device in many of Disney’s animated films. Of the 24 stories 
examined in the first study, 13 depend in part or whole on the development of a 
relationship between a male and a female character which has not to do with friendship, 
but love and mate selection. Those characters who are young and in search of a potential 
mate or love interest provide some of the most interesting material in these ﬁlms overall. 
There has been much commentary in the popular press on the extreme and unrealistic 
portrayal of young people’s physical beings, for both sexes. Doe-eyed heroines with tiny 
waists and heroes with bulging necks and overly muscular thighs have been roundly

TEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO DISCRIMINATE 
125 
criticized, with little effect. There is little or no discussion of the language spoken by lovers, 
however.18 
In spite of the setting of the story or the individual’s ethnicity, lovers and mothers 
speak mainstream varieties of U.S. or British English, with some interesting exceptions 
(Tables 7.6 and 7.7). Of the male characters, only two can be said to be logically and 
certainly speakers of U.S. English: Bernard who appears twice (Rescuers and Rescuers Down 
Under) and Jock (Lady and the Tramp). All the other characters are speakers of British or 
Australian English, or of languages other than English. The languages of the three princes 
(from Cinderella, Snow White and The Little Mermaid) are debatable: the Disney version 
never speciﬁes where these magical kingdoms are located (whether in the country of the 
story’s origin or elsewhere). 
Two of the male romantic leads speak socially marked varieties of U.S. English: in The 
Aristocats O’Malley (voiced by Phil Harris, a popular entertainer and singer of his day and 
cast on the power of voice recognition) does nothing to change or disguise his own English, 
which is rich in those characteristics which are often thought of as “working class” 
(simplified consonant clusters, double negative constructions, and other stigmatized

phonological and grammatical features). This is also the case with Jock from Lady and the 
Tramp. Both of these characters are prototypical rough lovers, men with an edge who need 
the care and attention of good women to settle them, and both are rewarded with such 
mates – females who speak non-stigmatized varieties – because they prove themselves 
worthy. There are no male romantic leads with foreign accents. 
There is even less variation among the female romantic leads. There are no rough, 
working-class equivalents of O’Malley and Jock. In fact, there is only one unambiguous 
case of a character who would logically speak U.S. English: Lady of Lady and the Tramp. 
The use of a typical or logical language for the part and background of the character is 
clearly less important in this case than a consistent portrayal of an ideal lover and potential 
mate which stresses the lack of “otherness.” 
However, there are two female characters (one of which occurs in two movies, Rescuers 
and Rescuers Down Under) with foreign accents, but they are both voiced by the same 
woman, Eva Gabor. The Gabor sisters were widely known and recognized in U.S. culture 
in the 1950s and 1960s for their glamor and demanding behavior in many highly publicized 
affairs with rich men. They were recognizable on the basis of their Hungarian accents, 
and they brought with them a set of associations about sexually aware and available females 
that resulted in typecasting. The roles that Eva Gabor voiced for Disney were thus of 
elegant, demanding and desirable females and as such have to be considered separately 
from other characters with foreign accents. 
In short 
Film producers like Disney are primarily concerned with engaging the audience and ﬁlling 
seats in the theater. As professional storytellers they understand a great deal about 
characterization, plot, setting, and all the other elements that make or break a production. 
Is it too much to expect ﬁlm makers to consider other issues, as well? Does the storyteller 
have any obligation to the viewers? These are questions that cannot be answers in this 
context, but they require close consideration. 
As one of the primary storytellers in the life of American children of all colors and 
ethnicities, Disney’s films have a deep and long-lasting effect on socialization and the 
development of identity – for both self and other. There is a growing body of scholarship 
which looks at Disney in a wider context and without apologist rhetoric, and that work 
makes clear how systematically Disney animated ﬁlm goes about setting up conceptions 
of good and evil with strong correlations to race and ethnicity. (Giroux’s The Mouse that 
Roared: Disney and the End of Innocence (2010) provides an overview of this literature.) The 
manipulation of accent is part of that process, and it works very well. 
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
Compile a list of Disney characters who speak English with a clear Anglo-New York City 
area accent. What do these characters have in common? Look at sociocultural 
characteristics, personality traits, motivations, style, and role in the plot. How do your 
ﬁndings support or contradiction the idea that stereotype does not have to be overtly 
negative to be limiting and prejudicial?

Murnane (2007) proposes that Disney films can be used in the classroom to teach 
multiculturalism. See: http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/whc/5.1/murnane.html. 
Choose one of the Disney animated ﬁlms and outline a middle school lesson plan that 
would accomplish such a goal. Be sure to include some aspect of language use and 
accent manipulation and to cite the sources of your information. 
Read “Demonizing in Children’s Television Cartoons and Disney Animated Films,” a short 
quantitative study of the concept of evil in Disney ﬁlms (Fouts et al. 2006). How do the 
findings of this paper contradict or support the data and conclusions drawn in this 
chapter? 
Consider the way you and others talk about Disney. Do you hear phrases such as 
“allowances have to be made for the times,” or “that’s the way things were,” or “everybody 
felt that way,” or “come on, it’s supposed to be funny”? Where do such reactions 
originate, and are they meant to move discussion forward, or to shut down discourse and 
critical analysis? For close readings of examples of this kind of reasoning, see especially 
Hill (2008). 
Notes 
1 Since the ﬁrst edition of this book appeared in 1997, formal study of all aspects of the 
Disney empire has grown signiﬁcantly (Doherty July 21, 2006). Of the work released 
over the last decade, perhaps most relevant to the issues raised here is Giroux’s The 
Mouse that Roared: Disney and the End of Innocence (2010: 2nd edn). 
Over that same period of time, Disney has released a number of full-length animated 
films. Given technical limitations, it is not possible to include those films in the 
quantitative analysis used for the pre-1997 ﬁlms, which remains intact. Instead, I have 
viewed and analyzed the newer films, and where they best fit into the discussion, I 
include my qualitative analysis. 
2 Fisch (2005) presents arguments for the constructive aspects of television viewing for 
children, who are exposed to positive role models and educational exercises in 
programming such as Sesame Street. 
3 Nielsen Media Research produces Nielsen ratings to measure U.S. television audience 
size and composition. 
4 Of course, other broadcast entertainment venues for children are not given a free pass. 
Consider the widely broadcast accusations of homosexuality among Teletubbies and 
Sesame Street characters (New York Times, February 11, 1999; Mikkelson 2007), or of 
satanic worship in the Harry Potter books.

about Pocahontas on her website at http://www.kstrom.net/isk/poca/. Note also that 
Russell Means, a Native American rights activist, was very vocal with his unconditional 
praise of Disney’s version of Pocahontas. His opinion is rendered suspect, however, 
because he took a prominent acting role in it.

dropped again during the Depression. In 1965, the average movie ticket price rose

and use of materials in academic publications for those scholars and academics whose 
work conﬂicts with the image they want to project. This may well be within their legal 
rights, but in the end it amounts to limiting and censoring discourse. 
9 There has been a great deal of speculation about Walt Disney’s ties to Nazi Germany 
and his anti-Semitic feelings more generally. While some evidence points to that 
conclusion, there is certainly not enough of it to make any claims along these lines. 
10 In 1930, the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) created 
a self-regulatory code of ethics. The ofﬁce charged with this duty was put under the 
direction of Will H. Hays, and went into effect on July 1, 1934. The Hays Office 
outlined general standards of good taste and speciﬁcally forbade certain elements in 
film. The code specified that “no picture shall be produced which will lower the 
standards of those who see it. Hence the sympathy of the audience should never be 
thrown to the side of crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin.” The speciﬁc regulations included 
(in paraphrase): (1) Revenge in modern times shall not be justiﬁed. (2) Methods of 
crime shall not be explicitly presented. (3) The sanctity of the institution of marriage 
and the home shall be upheld. (4) Miscegenation (interracial sexual relationships) is 
forbidden. The Code speciﬁcally addressed the inadvisability of caricaturing national 
origin groups or portraying them in offensive ways. In 1968 a Rating system was put 
into effect, and the Code was no longer used. 
11 Brode (2005: 101–103) argues that the representation of the wolf as Jewish peddler 
is not racist. As a part of his argument he acknowledges that such stereotypes existed 
(and he knows this because this is part of his own family history). “Besides, cartoons 
– with their extremely (and, for anyone who understands the medium, necessarily) 
broad form of portraiture – rely more heavily on caricature than any other cinematic 
form.” Brode goes on to add this odd bit of rationalization: “Disney may have created 
the wolf, but it is the wolf – the film’s villain – who invokes ethnic stereotyping” 
(ibid.: 103). 
12 Yiddish is a variety of German that originated in Jewish communities in Eastern 
Europe and spread to Jewish communities all over the continent. It was the first 
language of many Jews who immigrated to the United States in the last two centuries. 
While Yiddish spoken in Russia and the East is still vigorous, Western European 
Yiddish is dying out. In the U.S. about 150,000 people report speaking Yiddish at 
home, most of them resident in New York or Florida, with smaller populations in 
California, Pennsylvania and Illinois. 
13 It might be argued that many aspects of animated ﬁlms are actually aimed at the adults. 
14 Included in the study were full-length feature ﬁlms (generally between one and a half 
to two hours in length); speciﬁcally excluded short features and compilations of shorts 
grouped together for thematic reasons. Only fully animated films were included, 
excluding those that combine live-action sequences with animation (The Song of the 
South, Three Caballeros). Animated ﬁlm created for adult audience (the war-time ﬁlm 
Victory through Air Power is one example) were also omitted, as were Pixar ﬁlms which 
are not produced by Disney. All characters with speaking roles of more than single 
word utterances were included in the analysis. 
15 Note that Buena Vista is an umbrella term used for all aspects of Disney’s business 
entities. 
16 This reversal also occurs in The Hunchback of Notre Dame: Quasimodo, the son of two 
dark-skinned Romani (gypsies), has the milky complexion of a red-headed Irishman. 
A hero may be physically disabled, but he must also be Anglo, and his speech must 
sound Anglo.

and language markers but other patterns are still there, if muted. Critics have 
questioned the fact that the young African American main character spends about 
three-quarters of the ﬁlm as a frog: 
To make the ﬁrst African American princess a frog, then, seems to literally conﬂate 
her with animality. Tiana, mixing her dreams of success with a lack of intelligence 
and reason, is a black girl who must hop around like a frog in the way early twentieth-
century black actors had to don blackface and hop around like dogs. 
(Gehlawat 2010: 418) 
18 Characters of an age to pursue a partner who do not do so in the story line are usually 
portrayed as awkward, fat or ugly (examples include the stepsisters in Cinderella, the 
witch-like Cruella de Ville in 101 Dalmatians, and LaFou in Beauty and the Beast).

All media exist to invest our lives with artiﬁcial perceptions and arbitrary values. 
Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, 1965 
Media manipulation in the U.S. today is more efﬁcient than it was in Nazi Germany, 
because here we have the pretense that we are getting all the information we want. 
That misconception prevents people from even looking for the truth. 
Mark Crispin Miller, The Project on Media Ownership 
The voice of authority 
There is a large and very active community of academics who study the history, structure 
and function of the media, in all its guises. In contrast, the focus of this book is quite 
narrow, and can be summarized in a single question: how does the mass media – speciﬁcally 
the broadcast and print media outlets concerned with the dissemination of news – use the 
language subordination model presented in Chapter 5?1 
Media representatives claim authority in matters of language, and use that manufactured 
authority as a tool to coerce agreement on a wide range of public issues. This is a conscious, 
focused goal, as openly acknowledged in The Art of Editing: “The copy editor plays a major 
role in protecting the language against abuse” (from the chapter “Protecting the Language” 
in Baskette et al. 1986, cited in Cotter 1999: 175). 
The same is true of all dominant institutions, but the media have one advantage over 
the others. Educational institutions begin the formal process of inculcating individuals 
into an SLI, but at a certain age everyone moves beyond school and educational inﬂuence 
loses some or all of its intensity. Some – but not all – employers require adherence to an 
SLI. A skilled forklift driver is not likely to be scolded about the variety of English she 
speaks; nor is a shipping clerk in an auto parts store likely to be called onto the carpet 
because of her phonology;2 only the tiniest proportion of the population will ever submit 
a complaint or start legal proceedings on the basis of language-focused employment 
discrimination, and thus few will ever experience the way the judicial system and courts 
claim authority in these matters. 
But a very large proportion of the population has regular and intense exposure to 
broadcast or print news media of one kind or another. 
Language – the intrinsic and functional variability of language – is far more deeply 
integrated into our understanding of the world than any external symbol of wealth or 
inﬂuence. Linguistic variation linked to social identity is far more subtle. One way to think 
about this is by means of what Bourdieu calls the linguistic marketplace. In this theoretical 
model, an exchange between speaker and listener is about more than deciphering surface 
meaning. Sociolinguistic markers are “also signs of wealth, intended to be evaluated and

----- Page 156 (native) -----
THE INFORMATION INDUSTRY 
131 
appreciated, and signs of authority intended to be believed and obeyed” (Bourdieu and 
Thompson 1991: 66). A speech act’s value is based on power relations that have already 
been established, such as the mastery of linguistic competences marked for class. 
Linguistic utterances or expressions are always produced in particular contexts or 
markets, and the properties of these markets endow linguistic products with a certain 
“value” (ibid.: 18). It is important to note that there are multiple linguistic marketplaces, 
so that in some contexts a stigmatized variety of vernacular U.S. English may in fact have 
more persuasive power and capital than the smoothest talking National Public Radio 
reporter. This complexity was absent in the theory as Bourdieu ﬁrst developed it, but other 
scholars – in particular, anthropological linguists – have reﬁned it (Gal 2005; Schieffelin 
et al. 1998; Seargeant 2009; Woolard 2008). 
Media representatives have claimed for themselves a spot as national role models. And 
in fact, we allow them to chide us when our language differs from those varieties of English 
they speak, or think they speak. They have convinced us that they have the right to do 
this, and we do not challenge them. That unwillingness or inability to question such claims 
of authority does the real damage. “The most successful ideological effects are those which 
have no need for words, and ask no more than complicitous silence” (Bourdieu 1987: 188, 
emphasis added). 
In what follows, the focus is on the media as a powerful institution that plays a major 
role in the stability and perpetuation of the nation-state, and the way language serves 
as both a tool and a target in that process. Consider, for example, the phrase “voice of 
authority.” 
In the 1990s, ABC News produced a print advertisement featuring a head-shot of Peter 
Jennings, then senior editor and chief anchor of the news desk. Beneath the image of the 
photogenic Jennings was a single line of text: “The Voice of Authority.” Regardless of 
Jennings’ skill and the quality of his reporting, it requires a jump of faith to accept him – 
or any one person – as the ultimate voice of authority in the interpretation and reporting 
of current events.3 
A study of the various media outlets provides many examples of how representatives see 
themselves and want to be seen. Sometimes the claims are very boldly stated, as in the 
following during a (2005) National Public Radio broadcast: 
NPR is considered by many to be the standard bearer for Standard American English. 
Listeners from around the country and around the world say that they find NPR 
English is the clearest and most comprehensible broadcast English available. They 
can hear that crisp American English on NPR member stations, on their Web sites, 
on line at npr.org or on the listeners’ shortwave receivers. 
(Dvorkin 2005) 
As is often the case when authority is claimed in public forums, the identity and credentials 
of the cited expert are left conveniently in the shadows. The passive construction 
“considered by many” is a classic dodge in the tradition of “mistakes were made” (Broder 
2007). 
Such claims are not the largest part of the media’s participation in the language 
subordination process, which requires that the non-compliant be dealt with summarily. 
The newscasters and reporters seem to have two primary methods for drawing attention 
to non-conformers: mocking or condescension. In looking at how this works, there are 
two types of data to be considered: commentary made about matters of language, often

----- Page 157 (native) -----

derisive or condescending and news reports which are language focused. The following 
examples come from both broadcast and print new media. 
The idea is to teach them how to speak English so that it sounds like English, and not, 
as Henry Higgins might put it, like warmed-over grits. Think of them as prisoners – 
prisoners of their own accents. 
We like Hahn, 34, who was born in South Korea and whose positions on controlling 
growth are much like our own. Unfortunately, we think his heavy accent and some-
what limited contacts would make it difﬁcult for him to be a councilman. 
For all the damage now being done to the English language there are people who 
continue to care about its health. Dr. Grammar is one of them. 
No matter how qualiﬁed a person is, a voice twisted by regional or ethnic inﬂuences 
can be a stumbling block socially and professionally. If others can’t understand you 
or your words are too richly ﬂavored with down-home spice, you could ﬁnd all your 
skill and intelligence thwarted by a telltale tongue.4 
Newspaper headlines alone are sometimes quite sufﬁcient evidence of a particular slant 
on language issues: “Bad English Spoken Here” (McKenzie 1992); “Language is the 
Guardian of Culture” (Nenneman 1992); “Speak English, Troops” (Hamel 1989); “Black 
English Not Spoken Here” (Jarrett 1979a); “Oy Gevalt! New Yawkese an Endangered 
Dialect?” (Sontag 1993); “Today’s Youth’s Inability to Speak Proper English” (Quad-City 
Herald 2004). 
A new business venture may begin with a hole in the market – a real need which has 
not been ﬁlled – or with a need that has been placed in the mind of the public. Whiter 
teeth, for example, have been extensively promoted through advertising media. Someplace 
along the way such a need for a better, more efﬁcient, more elegant language was created 
in the minds of Americans.5 This followed not because speakers of English were suddenly 
no longer able to communicate with each other and required a solution, but because they 
were made to feel inadequate or ashamed. 
The parties sounding dire proclamations about the decline of spoken English are, not 
coincidentally, the ones with the cure to sell – those right-thinking and right-speaking 
individuals who are able to set the public on a straight and narrow path to the one true 
way of speaking. 
Opinion, spin, propaganda 
Editorial opinions are not out of place in any kind of information media, as long as they 
are clearly marked as such. The presentation of alternate interpretations is a public service, 
and an important one. In the past twenty years, however, the distinction between editorial 
commentary and news, between news and entertainment has given way to what has been 
called infotainment (Thussu 2011). 
Objectivity is a theoretical concept and hardly attainable in real-world communication, 
even by the best trained, widely experienced and most professional and sincere journalists. 
Every exchange of information comes with a context that is relevant to understanding the

----- Page 158 (native) -----
THE INFORMATION INDUSTRY 
133 
speaker’s intent. The purposeful lack or withholding of information is just as signiﬁcant 
as the presentation of demonstrable fact. It might be more useful to speak of a continuum 
from absolute, unvarnished truth to purposeful, unapologetic falsehood; from a theoretical 
purely objective to purely subjective. On this continuum, spin sits somewhere between the 
center point and the purely subjective. 
Everybody practices spin in communication. If you do very poorly on a performance 
review, you might tell your co-workers by starting with the fact that you had the ﬂu that 
day, or that everybody came in below the 70 percent mark, or that you were thinking of 
changing jobs anyway. You might not mention it at all. You might deny you were reviewed. 
Or, if you state the fact outright “My performance review came back totally unsatis-
factory,” the people you’re talking to might provide the spin for you and remind you that 
you had the ﬂu that week, or that nobody did very well because the manager conducting 
the reviews is a jerk. One of the most fruitful areas for study of spin and objectivity is the 
political campaign. 
The study of political language can take many points of departure. There are studies of 
style in public debate, audience focus, rhetorical tropes, metaphor, ritual insulting, and the 
use of humor, to name a few (Cienki and Mueller 2008; Clayman 1995; Dillard and Pfau 
2002; Lim 2008; Santa Ana 2002). George Lakoff (Lakoff 2004, 2006, 2008; Lakoff and 
Rockridge 2006) is one of very few linguists whose theories have come to the attention of 
the public. This happened at least in part because his work in discourse analysis and cognitive 
linguistics aroused the interest of a senior members of the Democratic Party, who were 
scrambling for new, more effective ways of reaching the public (Bai 2005). Lakoff became 
a consultant to many politicians who were interested in the concept of rhetorical framing. 
Lakoff’s work suggests that success in swaying public opinion has to do with a more 
effective and consistent set of rhetorical strategies, or a frame of reference so that “through 
cultural narratives, metaphors, and frames . . . we understand and express our ideals (Lakoff 
2008). 
In the late twentieth and early twenty-ﬁrst centuries, Republicans have tended to be 
much better at getting their message out to the public, and getting the public to listen. 
They do this, in part, by coining new, ideologically laden and emotive terminology and 
repeating those terms until they become embedded in the public consciousness. Two 
things are crucial to such a strategy: uniformity of style and rhetoric across the party, and 
repetition. 
In Whose Freedom?, Lakoff claims that liberals run into trouble because they operate on 
the basis of a self-defeating political rationalism, which is “a myth about reason and its 
relationship to politics” (Lakoff 2006: 249–251). Some primary characteristics of political 
rationalism are: (1) its defining nature for humans (it distinguishes us from other life 
forms); (2) its universality (everyone is rational); and (3) the fact that rational thought is a 
conscious process. 
A person who believes strongly in the value of rationalism will conclude that once the 
public has the facts, they will come to the same reasonable conclusion. Elections are (in 
Lakoff’s view) the proof that this model is simply wrong: “The facts alone will not set you 
free. If the frames that deﬁne common sense contradict the facts, the facts will be ignored” 
(ibid.: 251). 
The topic of frames will come up again shortly, but in the meantime, it is good to keep 
in mind that rational thought or rationalism is often called upon, but rarely proves useful 
as a tool to combat the language subordination process. It can be seen as a type of spin, 
and thus must be carefully examined.

THE INFORMATION INDUSTRY 
Propaganda goes far beyond spin and is generally understood to be the planned, 
systematic distribution of disinformation to achieve a particular end, as in the manufacture 
of consent, a concept that is central to this chapter. In matters of language, we can also 
speak of propaganda, albeit of a more subconscious and subtle variety. In as much as 
language about language is factually incorrect or misleading, it becomes self-referential 
propaganda: it serves as both the vehicle of disinformation and its object. This process is 
a difﬁcult one to look at closely, for while it is not so hard to reconstruct the motivations 
for the media’s positive representation of, for example, the outcome of the 2000 presi-
dential election, given the corporate structure and economic dependencies of broadcast 
and print journalism, the motivations that underlie the limiting of discourse are carefully 
masked. 
Among the wealth of material about propaganda in political discourse, there are two 
schools of thought which might be familiar to the general public. The first is George 
Orwell’s extensive writing on the subversion of power by means of language manipula-
tion, most particularly by the media in reporting on politics. The second is the concept 
of doublespeak (often falsely attributed to Orwell), which William Lutz describes as 
deliberate, calculated misuse of language (Lutz 2004; Orwell 2005). In both cases, the 
emphasis is on the use and manipulation of language by individuals associated with the 
government, politics, and the media. 
As an American, Lutz never denied the importance of freedom of the press as a basic 
liberty clearly stated in the Bill of Rights: “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the 
freedom of speech, or of the press. As a nation we are proud of the rights established by 
the ﬁrst ten amendments to the Constitution and generally very protective of those rights.” 
But the Founders did not deﬁne what they meant by “press” or “speech,” nor did they 
address the question of truthfulness or objectivity in reporting; that is, the idea of a fair 
and balanced press does not originate in our Constitution. The evolution of this idea is 
complex and worthy of close examination on its own. And yet, it seems that there is no 
ofﬁcial journalistic stance on issues such as spin, propaganda, framing and rationalism. 
Currently the Society of Professional Journalists has a Code of Ethics (http://www.spj.org/ 
ethicscode.asp): 
Public enlightenment is the forerunner of justice and the foundation of democracy. 
The duty of the journalist is to further those ends by seeking truth and providing a 
fair and comprehensive account of events and issues. Conscientious journalists from 
all media and specialties strive to serve the public with thoroughness and honesty. 
Professional integrity is the cornerstone of a journalist’s credibility. 
In the ﬁrst line, the setting of standards and ethics for journalists is not a matter of law, 
but of self-governance. That is, organizations like the Society of Professional Journalists 
can discuss what journalism can and should be; they can publish guidelines; they can even 
hold journalists who fail to meet those guidelines up for peer review and public criticism. 
In an extreme case, where a journalist has broken hard-line rules (quoting non-existent 
sources, knowingly presenting ﬁction as fact; direct plagiarism), he or she will simply no 
longer be unemployable as a journalist. If poor journalistic standards exceed a certain point, 
then the law may come into play. 
There are external watchdog organizations which take up the task of monitoring 
journalists and news sources – Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting and FactCheck.org are 
two of many. For the most part these non-proﬁt groups are scrupulously fair, pointing

out misrepresentations and exaggerations in both the Democratic and the Republican 
campaign rhetoric, for example. But beyond bringing questionable practices to the public’s 
attention, there is little they can do.6 
Traditional and new media outlets claim to strive for objectivity, but study of practices 
over time provides evidence that bias is widespread. Media outlets are businesses like any 
other, one that must answer to corporate owners; this fact necessarily influences the 
context in which they do their work. The media’s most effective tool in forming public 
opinion is quite obvious: they control the ﬂow of information, what we hear about, for 
how long, how that subject is framed, and in what detail. This is so widely acknowledged 
that dozens of organizations publish lists of the most underreported news stories at the 
end of every year.7 For example, there has been very little news from the mainstream 
outlets on the excesses of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which maintains 
more than a hundred secret facilities where persons suspected of immigration violations 
are warehoused (Stevens, January 4, 2010).8 
Not so long ago, the traditional media’s ability to withhold, misrepresent or trivialize 
potentially important or relevant news was a tool that could stop major legislation. More 
recently the rise of the internet and alternate media has made it much harder – and 
sometimes impossible – to bury a story.9 However, the media can still lift a story into the 
spotlight and keep it at the forefront for as long as it likes. In extreme cases, the media can 
institute or attempt to institute a moral panic (see the case study of the Oakland Ebonics 
debate in Chapter 16 for an example of how this process works). 
Bad is stronger than good 
Research in psychology and sociology has established beyond a doubt that negative and 
positive evaluations are not symmetrical (Baumeister et al. 2001). That is, it seems to be 
human nature to assign more weight and importance or validity to bad news than to good 
news. 
It is important to keep this in mind when considering the impact the media have on 
political campaigns and candidates. Bad news is far more interesting to the public than 
good news, from which follows the fact that bad news sells more papers and gets more 
broadcast coverage. However, there are many cases where a media outlet prefers to 
overlook the bad in favor of the good for a wide variety of reasons, few of which are neutral. 
Two examples at either extreme: during the Reagan presidency, there were multiple 
opportunities for the news media to show the administration and the president in a very 
unflattering light. They declined to do, and instead began referring to Reagan as “the 
Teflon president.” There’s an irony to that pronouncement – a sort of self-fulfilling 
prophecy – that was largely lost on the public. At the other extreme, it was the print news 
media that initiated a string of events that culminated in President Nixon’s impeachment 
trial and resignation. Woodward and Bernstein’s reports about break-ins at the Watergate 
Hotel and their refusal to give up the chase got the attention of the public and Congress, 
which was eventually compelled to act (Sigleman and Tuch 1997). 
Here I look more closely at the 2008 presidential election; ﬁrst, at issues of language 
ideology, social class, and media gatekeeping as reﬂected in the media coverage of former 
governor Sarah Palin, followed by a similar study of the Obama campaign and rhetorical 
framing.

----- Page 161 (native) -----

THE INFORMATION INDUSTRY 
The 2008 presidential election 
In the 2008 presidential election – and in all elections to come – the mainstream media 
outlets found themselves competing with cable television offerings and, more signiﬁcantly, 
the internet. An unprecedented wealth and variety of information, analysis and opinion 
became – and continues to become – available. This has both complicated and ampliﬁed 
the framing process. 
There was a striking and unprecedented contrast between candidates in 2008. Some 
mainstream news outlets capitalized more extensively on these contrasts than others. 
On one extreme (the conservatively oriented Fox news programs) news reporters and 
commentators were very positive about Governor Palin and negative about Senator 
Obama; MSNBC News reporters and commentators took the opposite stance.10 When 
rhetoric got out of hand, responsible media and watchdog organizations that set out to 
correct the public record were usually lost in the roar of the crowd. 
To establish one point very clearly at the outset: every politician, every public speaker, 
every individual adjusts style and language to suit their audience and elicit desired 
reactions.11 We adjust without thinking about it, for the most part. In politics, however, 
there is a performance aspect to public speaking, and thus the way in which politicians 
shift can be very deliberately planned. Whether spontaneous or planned, some individuals 
are more successful than others at shifting in style to engage the audience. 
Framing Palin 
We believe that the best of America is not all in Washington, D.C. . . . We believe 
that the best of America is in these small towns that we get to visit, and in these 
wonderful little pockets of what I call the real America, being here with all of you 
hard working very patriotic, um, very, um, pro-America areas of this great nation. 
Sarah Palin, public address, Greensboro, NC, October 16, 2008) 
As is the case with every politician who comes into national focus, as soon as former 
Governor Sarah Palin had accepted the Republican vice-presidential candidacy in the 2008 
presidential election, the media outlets began their investigations. Broadcast, print and 
internet news sources reported on the Governor’s history, her performance as a politician 
and a government ofﬁcial, and her positions on topics relevant to the role she sought. In 
Palin’s case, additional subjects were added: her appearance, the nature of her religious 
beliefs, and her children and family circumstances were also brought into play.12 That is, 
much of the debate around Palin’s candidacy was gendered, and as such, overtly sexist.13 
Beyond sexism was the issue of socioeconomic class. 
In the course of an election campaign, political parties focus on speciﬁc groups within 
the population where they need support. Palin was presented as a small-town, working-
class American mother with a no-nonsense approach to politics. At the same time, she 
accused her Democratic opponents of being too removed from “real Americans” to know 
what was needed. She emphasized the difference (as she saw it) between city and country, 
secular and non-secular, and the classes. 
Palin speaks a regional variety of American English speciﬁc to the Matanuska-Susitna

public appearances, the Governor chose to emphasize her regional features, which was 
one way to underscore her origins and claim a certain kind of authority.14 Sarah Palin’s

stylistic choices got the immediate attention of the media and the public, in large part 
because her public speaking style was remarkably informal (Purnell et al. 2009). 
An open and frank discussion of socioeconomic class is not the usual way of things in a 
national campaign. Instead Palin used language features to set her own frame. This policy 
provided a way for detractors to zero in on what some saw as a serious lack of education 
and world knowledge. The Governor’s folksy style was apparently designed to establish 
her authenticity, and so in challenging her linguistic choices, observers were also chal-
lenging her sincerity and the authenticity of the frame she established for herself. 
Questions about the origins of Palin’s regional variety of American English,15 the way 
she sometimes “dropped the g sound” in words like going (Liberman 2004); her pro-
nunciation of the word nuclear;16 and her use of euphemistic forms such as heck, darn, and 
doggone (Evans Davies 2009; Purnell et al. 2009) all became the focus of negative attention. 
Note that I am distinguishing between the content, logic and quality of Palin’s state-
ments (which I will not evaluate here), on the one hand, and, on the other, the socio-
linguistic markers in her speech. 
It is likely that everyone who ever ran for higher ofﬁce has had detractors who focused 
on their variety of English and speciﬁc language traits. The difference in Palin’s case was 
the extent to which the news media chose to be a part of the process. A few words about 
the nature of satire and parody will help in understanding the media’s role in the linguistic 
subordination of Sarah Palin. 
Satire uses humor to make an emotion-laden subject easier to approach, while in parody, 
the humor is an end unto itself. Those who employ parody aim in the ﬁrst line to entertain 
with extreme portrayals of established ideas or characters. Satire is less dependent on 
mimicry, and has a larger underlying purpose that arises out of anger and frustration. 
It is possible to achieve both at one time. Currently the most popular example is The 
Comedy Network’s The Colbert Report. Colbert’s parody of a conservative talk-show host 
is humorous on the surface, but his purpose is more than humor. The entire show is an 
elaborate satire that is meant to throw light on what Colbert believes is wrong and what 
needs to change in the American government. 
In the time running up to a presidential election, all candidates are open targets for 
parody and satire. Political cartoonists, comedians, commentators all take part in this 
ritual. In parody, the performer begins by studying a candidate in order to identify his or 
her most distinctive characteristics. In the first line these are often linguistic features 
(phonology, lexical items, grammar), gestures, mannerisms, and other distinctive aspects 
of communication. There may be an attempt to look and dress like the object of the 
parody, while the content of the communication originates in the subject’s ideas, beliefs 
and actions. By contrast, the comedian reproduces the subject’s language and style, 
emphasizing certain aspects for humor’s sake. Mockery of this kind is meant to expose 
what is silly or ridiculous (in the opinion of the performer), and to open the object up 
for criticism and ridicule. 
In its extreme form, mockery provides a shortcut to language-focused subordination. 
Sociolinguists, critical language theorists and anthropological linguists are interested in 
mocking as an overt gesture of gatekeeping, one clearly intended to pass on a negative 
message about the person being mocked. In the study of linguistic and stylistic mocking, 
the emphasis has been primarily linked to race and ethnicity. There is a great deal of work 
on Mock Spanish (Hill 1995; 1998; 2008); African American English (Ronkin and Karn 
1999) and the accents of Asians who learn English as a second language (Huebner and 
Uyechi 2004; Klein and Shiffman 2006; Lo 1999), among others. Less work has been done

when the underlying motivator is not racism or xenophobia, but socioeconomic class dis-
tinctions. 
In the case of Palin’s candidacy for vice-president, it is precisely such socioeconomic 
class distinctions which were brought into play. The campaigners took a carefully 
calculated stand when they presented Palin to the electorate using associations that come 
along with her constant references to small-town, Joe Six-Pack, hockey-mom, and the 
working class. Darling (2009: 16) contends that terms like these “represent a set of conﬂa-
tions which link whiteness, rurality and poverty to backwardness and conservatism.” 
In the months before a presidential election, there is an upswing in parody and mockery 
that no major candidate escapes. In the 2008 election campaign, one of the most watched 
sources for this kind of parody was NBC’s Saturday Night Live (SNL), a television sketch 
comedy show which has provided parody and satire of presidential candidates since the 1970s. 
In the 2008 election, SNL’s Tina Fey (a former cast member who returned in order to 
take on this role) performed several parodies of Sarah Palin to great acclaim. Critics and 
commentators drew attention, repeatedly, to the facility with which Fey recreated Palin’s 
dialect or accent. 
In “The Linguistic Mocking of Sarah Palin,” Davies (2009) compares the SNL parodies 
of all four candidates (McCain, Palin, Obama, Biden) and finds that in three cases, 
idiosyncratic traits were ampliﬁed for the sake of humor, but in Palin’s case the underlying 
message was distinctly different. Davies proposes that those who wrote the skits about 
Palin meant to expose the candidate’s faults and make them available for ridicule, in order 
to demonstrate her unsuitability for ofﬁce. 
In fact, there was nothing unusual or inappropriate in this; parody and satire are 
protected rights, and SNL has a proud history of taking a political stand. But with every 
new parody of Palin, the tone intensiﬁed. Finally, the information industry got involved. 
Rather than simply observing and reporting news from the campaign, news media began 
to fold information and reports about Fey’s parody of Palin into their coverage, obscuring 
the line between satire and news. Clips of the skits began to show up on major news 
broadcasts, sometimes paired with clips of Palin herself. On a CNN news broadcast, Wolf 
Blitzer took pains to point out how Fey’s parody had further solidified the general 
impression that Palin had performed very badly in a televised interview (CNN’s Late 
Edition, September 28, 2008). 
This phenomenon did not elude the Republican campaign organizers or Palin’s 
supporters. Writing for The Rocky Mountain News after Fey’s parody of Palin’s interview 
with Katie Couric had aired, Littwin noted that “Palin needed to be perceived as semi-
credible again, meaning that when people looked at her, they didn’t see Tina Fey. In other 
words, she needed a debate that didn’t provide a late-night TV punch line” (2008). 
Darling posits that when mocking has reached this stage, the object has lost all 
credibility and cannot be taken seriously, something borne out by the commentary of the 
time in news reports of all kinds: 
Communication is critical for Palin, since she mangles the English language so 
consistently that she’s become the subject of ridicule. 
(Zirin 2008) 
But Palin is also alarmingly unskilled when it comes to a more indigenous matter: 
speaking the English language. 
(Maura Kelly, an American freelance journalist writing for The Guardian)

There is a broader perspective to take into account when looking at the variety of media 
commentary. Thinking in terms of the linguistic marketplace, mockery and parody are 
not all powerful and do not transcend every social barrier. Many observers dismissed out 
of hand the recasting and parody of Palin’s language and ideas. For such persons, the 
parody may not have discredited Palin, but it certainly further cemented sky-high social 
class animosities. Commentators who ridiculed Palin’s accent or pronunciation of certain 
words were offending a large part of their audience, because the features of Palin’s speech 
that were mocked were features prominent in a wide variety of regional accents closely 
allied to working class communities and individuals. 
CNN commentators and Keith Olberman (MSNBC) drew attention to Palin’s 
pronunciation of nuclear (4 October 2008) and openly mocked her informal style (7 
October 2008); writing in The New York Times, Maureen Dowd went into detail about 
what she saw as Palin’s grammatical errors: 
She dangles gerunds, mangles prepositions, randomly exiles nouns and verbs and also 
– “also” is her favorite vamping word – uses verbs better left as nouns, as in, “If 
Americans so bless us and privilege us with the opportunity of serving them,” or how 
she tried to “progress the agenda.” 
(October 4) 
Robert Schlesinger of U.S. News and World Report went so far as to point out a typo in one 
of Palin’s mailings. 
Commentators and news reporters who were openly critical of the way Palin expressed 
herself (instead of, or in addition to, commentary on the ideas she was trying to com-
municate) were gatekeeping. That is, they drew attention to Palin’s pronunciation or style 
in order to bolster the argument she is not one of us. This is a common strategy in political 
campaigns. But in Palin’s case, that approach added credibility to Palin’s frame for herself; 
rather than be embarrassed about the faults held up for public ridicule, she embraced the 
associations made. Her linguistic choices seemed to telegraph her dislike and distrust of 
what she characterized as the liberal mindset and intellectualism.17 The goal, it seemed, 
was to reach those who identified with her and “the overall theme that Ms. Palin and 
Senator John McCain have been trying to advance: that expertise is overrated, homespun 
sincerity is better than sophistication, conviction is more important than analysis” (Pinker 
2008). Palin’s anti-intellectualism has been compared to class warfare, both by her critics 
and those who supported the Republican Party and its candidates in the 2008 campaign: 
Palin is smart, politically skilled, courageous and likable. Her convention and debate 
performances were impressive. But no American politician plays the class-warfare 
card as constantly as Palin. Nobody so relentlessly divides the world between the 
“normal Joe Sixpack American” and the coastal elite 
(Brooks 2008). 
It would be a mistake to generalize on the basis of observations about Palin to conservatives 
more generally. The National Review, founded by William F. Buckley, Jr., is generally seen 
as a cradle of conservative intellectualism and a home “for erudite and well-mannered 
debate” (Arango 2008). In this conservative setting, intellectualism and education are 
highly valued; those conservative elites who trained in Buckley’s model (such as David 
Frum and David Brooks, quoted here) did not seem so focused on Palin’s intelligence or 
lack of intelligence in their public commentary during the campaign. Far more interesting

was Palin’s willingness and seemingly instinctive ability to take on the party strategy built 
on language ideology, confrontational rhetorical style and class conﬂicts: 
But over the past few decades, the Republican Party has driven away people who live 
in cities, in highly educated regions and on the coasts. This expulsion has had many 
causes. But the big one is this: Republican political tacticians decided to mobilize their 
coalition with a form of social class warfare . . . The nation is divided between the 
wholesome Joe Sixpacks in the heartland and the oversophisticated, overeducated, 
oversecularized denizens of the coasts. What had been a disdain for liberal intellectuals 
slipped into a disdain for the educated class as a whole 
(Brooks 2008)

[O]ur most brilliant presidents often work hard to seem publicly dumb in order to 
avoid the stain of elitism. 
Lim, The Anti-Intellectual Presidency: The Decline of 
Presidential Rhetoric from George Washington to George W. Bush, 2008 
Lim based the observation above on his study of presidential speech between 1913 and 
the end of the George W. Bush administration. His quantitative analysis of the presidential 
speeches provided some surprising observations: 
Between 1913 and 2008, the length of the average presidential sentence fell from 35 
words to 22. 
Between the advent of broadcast media and George W. Bush’s last day in ofﬁce, sound 
bites declined in length from 42 seconds to 7. 
In the ﬁrst decade of the 1900s, presidential speeches were pitched at a college reading 
level; by 2008, the level was closer to eighth grade. 
Where and why the overt dislike and distrust of intellectualism originated is a question 
that requires more close study and thought than can be taken up in this volume. What 
can be said with certainty is that in the current day, politicians and media both employ 
anti-intellectualism to appeal to what may be the larger portion of the voting (and money-
spending) population. 
This was especially the case during the George W. Bush administration. “As he takes 
to the road to salvage his presidency, Bush is letting down his guard and playing up his 
anti-intellectual, regular-guy image” (Baker 2006). In a book that has seen multiple 
editions and reprintings, the conservative popular historian Paul Johnson makes no bones 
about his distrust of all things intellectual: “Beware intellectuals. Not merely should they 
be kept well away from the levers of power, they should also be objects of suspicion when 
they seek to offer collective advice” (1988: 342).18 
With the election of Senator Barack Obama to the ofﬁce of president, anti-intellectualism 
has continued to escalate at a rapid pace. In Obama’s case, allusions to education and elitism 
are complicated by race. 
The media – speciﬁcally Fox News commentators – have played a large role in framing 
Obama as an out-of-touch elite, an intellectual who doesn’t understand and harbors disdain 
for the common man. Discussions of Obama as an elitist often skew toward the silly, as

was the case when the president stopped to have lunch at an Arlington, Virginia, diner on 
May 5, 2009. Commentators and newscasters including Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, 
Mark Steyn, Rush Limbaugh along with dozens of bloggers and a Cornell law professor 
all joined forces in deriding Obama’s preference for Dijon mustard. The implication was 
that American mustard wasn’t good enough for the president. Six days later, the Dijon 
débâcle had reached the mainstream media and Jason Linkins of The Huffington Post 
declared that this attack on Obama’s choice of condiments had become a full-blown right-
wing talking point (see Media Matters for America, 7 May 2009, for a summary of Dijon-
gate commentary). 
At first, many saw the election of an African American to the highest office in the 
country as a huge step forward in race relations. But racism in the United States did not 
go away with the Emancipation Proclamation or the Civil Rights Act, and it did not 
disappear with Obama’s election. Those who think in racist terms – at least those who 
depend on public opinion for their jobs – know better than to voice racist opinions openly. 
On the surface at least, overt racism is rejected by all institutions, including the mainstream 
media. Nevertheless, prejudiced sentiments are still voiced, but by use of code words or 
euphemisms. During the 2008 campaign and the ﬁrst year of Obama’s presidency there 
was ample opportunity to watch such rhetorical strategies develop. 
Code words can be used to a politician’s advantage in reaching a speciﬁc audience within 
an audience. One African American journalist drew attention to the way that [Obama’s] 
“language, mannerisms and symbols resonate deeply with his Black supporters, even as 
the references largely sail over the heads of white audiences.” 
In a similar way, George W. Bush used certain phrases that were meant to be understood 
by conservative Christians. This targeting of one audience is sometimes referred to as 
“dog-whistle rhetoric,” a reference to the way that it is possible to get a dog’s attention 
by blowing a whistle that humans cannot hear. The use of code words permits public 
mention of otherwise taboo topics. Terms such as “equal opportunity” or “quota” are clear 
signals that can be read as follows: “I can’t say this aloud because it will get me in trouble, 
but I don’t like afﬁrmative action, and I think quotas reward those who don’t deserve it.” 
Public comments about Senator Obama during the campaign and after ranged from 
highly charged to subtle code words. The comments in Table 8.1 all come from politicians, 
government ofﬁcials and media representatives. 
In the examples provided, the most startling and openly racist is the use of the word 
“boy” to refer to President Obama. In Ash v. Tyson Foods (2006) the Supreme Court 
ruled that under certain circumstances, calling an African American male “boy” was indeed 
evidence of discriminatory intent. Not every use of the word could be considered racist 
or discriminatory, but “it does not follow that the term, standing alone, is always benign. 
The speaker’s meaning may depend on various factors including context, inﬂection, tone 
of voice, local custom, and historical usage” (Ash v. Tyson Foods 2006). 
Almost as evocative and offensive as “boy” is the word “uppity.” In the South especially, 
the use of “uppity” to describe an African American is a strong expression of condem-
nation. It is a way of chastising someone who aspires to more than is his or her place in 
life, in terms of education or lifestyle. A person who didn’t show subservience – speciﬁcally 
an African American who insisted on living a full life – was “uppity.” 
In the wake of criticism of Representative Lynn Westmoreland’s use of the word (The 
Washington Post, September 4, 2008), he steadfastly claimed he didn’t know that “uppity” 
had racist connotations, an assertion that did not fall into the realm of plausible deni-
ability.19 So outrageous was Westmoreland’s assertion of ignorance that other prominent 
Republicans from the South spoke openly and critically of the incident:

There has been a very intentional effort to paint [Obama] as somebody outside the 
mainstream, other, “he’s not one of us.” I think the McCain campaign has been 
scrupulous about not directly saying it, but it’s the subtext of this campaign. 
Everybody knows that. There are certain kinds of signals. As a native of the South, I 
can tell you, when you see this Charlton Heston ad, “The One,” that’s code for, “he’s 
uppity, he ought to stay in his place.” Everybody gets that who is from a Southern 
background. We all understand that. When McCain comes out and starts talking 
about afﬁrmative action, “I’m against quotas,” we get what that’s about. 
(August 3, 2008) 
During the campaign detractors often used “arrogant” and “elite” in their criticisms of 
Obama. This was not entirely a matter of chance, as was made clear in an anonymous 
Republican campaign strategy memo that was came into the public domain shortly before 
the election: 
The tactics that got [the Republican Party] to mid-September in a tie are not going 
to get them to 50 percent plus one in November. They need . . . an eye toward driving 
out the range of contrast that makes McCain different from Obama (action-oriented 
rhetoric v. grand prose; accessible v. uppity; humble servant of country v. arrogant. 
(Allen 2008) 
Of the terms discussed here (there are many others deserving examination), “articulate” 
may be the most opaque to those who are not African American (Robinson 2007; 
Clementson 2007). In her article “The racial politics of speaking well,” Clementson 
interviewed successful African Americans to get their reactions to the word “articulate,” 
with some interesting results: “Al Sharpton is incredibly articulate. But because he speaks 
with a cadence and style that is ﬁrmly rooted in black rhetorical tradition you will rarely 
hear white people refer to him as articulate” (Trisha Rose, as quoted in Clementson 2007).20 
To call any person of color “articulate” is to express surprise at the high quality of that 
person’s rhetorical skills. A similar but less direct pseudo-compliment sounds something 
like “you speak so well,” which is usually taken as “you speak so well for an African 
American,” or “you speak so well in comparison to other Asians.” John McWhorter, a 
sociolinguist, conservative commentator and an African American, reports one such 
experience, in which someone wrote a letter to praise him for speaking *SAE “conﬁdently,” 
which he found to be insulting: “as if I have to take a deep breath and ‘wield’ [*SAE] and 
feel like I’m a pretty special fella for being able to, with my ‘native’ ghetto inﬂections and 
expressions turning up in my speech when I’m tired” (McWhorter, January 9, 2010). 
Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat, was widely criticized when his comments on Obama 
were made public. Reportedly Reid talked about the fact that the Senator was “light 
skinned” and that he spoke “with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one” 
(Heilemann and Halperin 2010: 37). 
Obama accepted Reid’s public apology with good grace. Part of the reason for that easy 
acceptance may well have had to do with the fact that Obama is indeed bidialectal, 
something he acknowledges himself. In his audiobook recording of his biographical 
Dreams of my Father, long passages are written in scene, with dialog reconstructed from 
remembered conversations. Obama shows a real talent for voicing people from many 
different cultures and language communities. He voices himself as an 18-year-old in 
conversation with other Black men, switching back and forth between *SAE and AAVE

easily: “I learned to slip back and forth between my Black and white worlds, understanding 
that each possessed its own language and customs and structures of meaning” (Obama 
2004: 82). 
During the campaign Obama demonstrated his ability to shift into AAVE intonation 
and style on occasion. When Obama was paying the tab after lunch at a diner, the African 
American cashier asked him whether he wanted change, to which Obama said, “Nah, we 
straight.” This small example of his ability to shift into AAVE was caught on tape, and 
reported on in a very limited way (March 10, 2009). 
It is interesting to note that conservative commentators would try to drum up negative 
feelings for President Obama on the basis of his preferred mustard, but fail to draw atten-
tion to the fact that he can – and does – speak a highly stigmatized variety of English in 
some situations. Did the news media simply not notice these events when they happened, 
or did they choose not to comment because the topic was too sensitive? They had no such 
reservations when commenting on Sarah Palin’s variety of English. So why the disparate 
treatment? 
After the 2008 election, the conservative news media commentary about Obama 
intensified. The most extreme public commentary originated from people like Bill 
O’Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck, who did not hesitate to use words like “blood-
sucker,” “socialism,” and “fascism” in reference to the president. Radio news commentator 
Lee Rodgers claimed Obama “clearly is more sympathetic with the long-term goals of 
world communism, and let’s be blunt about it, Muslim terrorists, than with any legitimate 
American goals” (The Lee Rodgers Show, March 11, 2009). 
Joe Scarborough is a MSNBC cable news commentator and former member of the 
House of Representatives, a native of Florida and a prominent Republican with a large 
following. In commenting on Obama’s policies, he lamented that under Obama the 
country is “moving closer toward European-style socialism . . . That’s not a right-wing 
claim, it’s the truth” (Morning Joe, MSNBC, March 4, 2009). 
People may consider such outbursts nothing more than overblown rhetoric designed 
to draw a larger audience or sell more newspapers, but constant repetition of misleading, 
frightening images will take hold, regardless of the original intent. 
The media played a signiﬁcant role in the 2008 election, one that reached far beyond 
objective reporting. For both Palin and Obama, the variety of English spoken by the 
candidate became the focus, a way to draw attention to facts or events which could not be 
raised otherwise within the conﬁnes of what is socially acceptable. Potential concern about 
Palin’s working-class, rural connections (real or embellished) was subverted into a 
discussion of her syntax and “g-dropping.” In Obama’s case, the unvoiced questions were 
more complex and touched on highly explosive topics, such as “Can we trust an African 
American man who sounds like Obama?” 
The questions raised by the media may be sensible or silly, constructive or disruptive, 
but the importance or relevance of those questions does not determine how successfully 
they will take root in the public’s mind. The media can make things come true by simple 
repetition, or proof by assertion. A demonstrably false claim that is constantly repeated 
will gain a foothold. This is a tactic that doesn’t always work, but it seems to be particularly 
successful in political contexts. When it does work, the constant repetition may wear down 
the opposition so that they retreat or surrender, at which point the proof by assentation 
is complete. 
The power of the media in the political process can hardly be underestimated, and one 
of the most important tools to this end is the language subordination process.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
This chapter opened with a quote from Mark Crispin Miller who is associated with The 
Project on Media Ownership at Johns Hopkins University. Use the internet to learn about 
the project, its goals and approaches, and consider Miller’s comment in that context 
before discussing it. In your ﬁrst reaction, did you feel Miller’s position was polemic and 
exaggerated, or did you accept the concepts more easily? What factors in your own life 
and experience inform your reactions to such statements? 
Consider the statement made above on p. 131 by a National Public Radio representative. 
Note the use of passive construction “NPR is considered by many” and ambiguous 
“people say” claims. What does the speaker mean speciﬁcally by the words “cleanest” 
and “crisp”? What is the unstated opposite? 
The following excerpt from The Providence Journal Bulletin is presented as news. How 
does it incorporate stages in the underlying language subordination process? 
No matter how qualified a person is, a voice twisted by regional or ethnic 
inﬂuences can be a stumbling block socially and professionally. If others can’t 
understand you or your words are too richly ﬂavored with down-home spice, you 
could ﬁnd all your skill and intelligence thwarted by a telltale tongue.

this newspaper excerpt from a short report on the front page of The Evening Record 
(Ellensburg, Washington) of November 22, 1937 in your reply: 
President Roosevelt refused today to concede he used bad grammar. Shown 
an open letter by Professor Janet R. Aiken of Columbia University questioning 
his grammar in recent speeches, the president smilingly blamed newsmen who 
reported his extemporaneous remarks. . . . In her letter, Dr. Aiken wanted to know: 
“Did you learn how to [talk] that way at Groton or Harvard or where?” 
What does “manufactured authority” or “manufacturing authority” mean? What would 
be its opposite? 
Consider the following quotes from newspaper reports on accent reduction or elimination 
classes. What kind of imagery is used? Are logical fallacies evident?

professionals believe that their accents impede their careers, and they are 
prepared to pay hundreds of dollars to free their English from traces of their 
homelands . . . A person with a heavy accent may start his or her career in a 
technical job where few speaking skills are required, but advancement usually 
brings a greater emphasis on communication. An employee who is difﬁcult to 
understand may be shrugged off as stupid or simply passed over in favor of 
someone who speaks clear English.

is a sociolinguist and an African-American. Does anything surprise you about his position? 
In what points might you agree? 
How has the meaning of the word “spin” changed over the past 20 years? What do you 
understand it to be? Why do people choose to say “That’s just spin,” rather than explain 
the beliefs that cause them to reject the message? 
Imagine you walk into a meeting room and somebody comes up to you, looks you up and 
down, and smiling broadly says, “Congratulations! You buttoned your shirt correctly!” 
How is this like (or not like) African American objections to being called articulate? 
Consider this idea from Tim Wise’s Between Barack and a Hard Place: Racism and White 
Denial in the Age of Obama (2009). Wise proposes that racism has evolved to look like 
“enlightened exceptionalism . . . that allows for and even celebrates the achievements of 
individual persons of color . . . because they are seen as different from a less appealing, 
even pathological Black or brown rule” (ibid.: 9). Beyond the use of the word “articulate” 
in describing President Obama, is there other evidence of this kind of enlightened 
exceptionalism in the media’s commentary on Obama’s language, or more generally? 
Notes 
1 Here the terms “mass media” and “public media” are used interchangeably to mean 
communication formats designed to reach a large audience, for example, as in a nation-
wide broadcast of a presidential speech. Traditionally “mass media” is understood to 
include nationwide radio, large circulation newspapers and magazines, and television. 
“News media,” by contrast, refers to the communication of information about current 
events, at least in part, and encompasses broadcast, print, and internet sources. 
2 The issue of bilingualism and discrimination in the workplace linked to bilingualism 
is relevant here, but for the moment the discussion is restricted to native speakers of 
English. 
3 Other broadcasters have been described as voices of authority, as well. For example, the 
phrase was heard in connection with Walter Cronkite especially at the time of his 
death in 2009.

Vanderbilt University. The archive has tape of ABC, NBC and CBS national news

broadcasts for every day since the mid-1960s; all of these are indexed. The archive also 
includes MacNeil-Lehrer and CNN Headline News reports since those services 
began, but those broadcasts are not indexed. All of the reports I was able to ﬁnd were 
from the big three networks, which have been supplemented with other reports from 
my own daily viewing notes. The sources, in order of presentation: CBS Evening News, 
1984; San Jose Mercury News, October 18, 1984; The Providence Journal Bulletin, April 
1994; NBC Evening News, April 1993. 
5 Language as a social tool is a human trait and not speciﬁc to any country. The process 
whereby authority in matters of language is seized has been widely institutionalized. 
In France, L’Académie française publishes an ofﬁcial French dictionary and is probably 
the best known institution of its kind. However, many countries and nation-states 
have institutions to promote what is believed to be the “right” or “proper” variety of 
language. Hindi, Korean, Foroese, Danish, Wolof are just a few examples. 
6 Hermann and Chomsky’s Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass 
Media was ﬁrst published in 1988 with a second edition dated 2002. This collection 
of case studies provides a propaganda model composed of a number of news ﬁlters, 
which expose, for example, the way The New York Times took on the government’s 
ofﬁcial position and thus promoted militarism and the Vietnam War. This is a seminal 
work for anyone interested in critical language studies. 
7 There is a class of popular newspapers which takes a markedly different approach, which 
seems to be: anything that will sell a paper, no matter how outrageous or misleading, 
goes up front and center. The rest of this chapter excludes discussion of tabloids. 
8 For example, in December 2005, Congress passed the Defense Authorization Act 
which granted exemption from the Freedom of Information Act to the Pentagon and 
the Department of Defense. This story was absent from almost all broadcast and 
newspaper news reports, despite its relevance to the freedom of the press. 
9 See, for example, Jane Hill’s analysis of the incident that led to former Senator Trent 
Lott’s resignation as Majority Leader of the Senate, in which the mainstream media 
attempted to ignore an unambiguously racist statement until it was brought to public 
attention by prominent bloggers. 
10 Fox News and MSNBC are perhaps the most openly partisan television news outlets. 
This is not to say that all media representatives from other outlets were strictly 
objective; there is plenty of evidence to show that this is not the case. 
11 When a politician tries and fails to style shift to be more in line with the audience, the 
media can be merciless. Such an event happened during the 2008 campaign, when 
Hillary Clinton allegedly attempted to sound African American or Southern when 
addressing a primarily African American audience in Selma, Alabama. See Media 
Matters for America (http://mediamatters.org/research/200709130001). 
12 See Heﬂick and Goldenberg (2009) on the objectiﬁcation of Sarah Palin. 
13 Overt sexism in the media was not restricted to male commentators: “Kristan, we’ve 
talked this morning about whether a mother of ﬁve can handle being the vice president. 
Who looks after the kids when she’s working? Do you know?” (Maggie Rodriguez, 
CBS, Early Show). Nor was Palin the only woman to experience sexism – both overt 
and covert – in the 2008 election cycle. Such incidents (as in the example of men 
shouting “Iron my shirt!” at a Hillary Clinton rally) were rarely covered in any depth. 
14 Purnell, Raimy and Salmons conducted an extensive study of Palin’s speech; among 
other avenues of inquiry, they examined historical settlement patterns and how 
movement of ethnic groups contributed to Wasillian English. They examined the way 
certain phonetic features contribute to the national perception of Palin’s English as 
Upper Midwestern.

15 These and similar subjects became hot topics for discussion online. For example, see 
http://xrl.in/4xcm where blogger Sisyphusshrugged presents evidence of what he has 
called Palin’s Intermittent Gunderson Syndrome. The term is a reference in a 
character in the movie Fargo. Marge Gunderson is a Minnesotan with strong regional 
language features; the intermittent syndrome is a reference to the fact that Sarah Palin 
allegedly slips in and out of this accent in a way that is inauthentic. See also this post: 
http://xrl.in/4xdn from Shots in the Dark which explains very clearly how the author 
connects certain language uses with intelligence, or lack of intelligence, in the case of 
Sarah Palin. 
16 The word “nuclear” became a focus of debate among linguists as well as media com-
mentators. Nunberg provides an objective look at the debate, the variable pronun-
ciation, and the social signiﬁcance of the word. (“Going nucular: Language, politics, 
and culture in confrontational times,” Nunberg 2006.) 
17 In addition to Lim’s work on anti-intellectualism discussed brieﬂy in this chapter, there 
is a great deal of work on the complex links between ideology, rhetoric and anti-
intellectualism that began with the 1963 publication of Hofstadter’s Anti-intellectualism 
in American Life. See also Gonzalez (2009), Brooks (2008), Savage (2008) and Gitlin 
(2000). 
18 I must point out that this statement, blunt and uncompromising as it may be, can be 
adapted to discussion of any group. “Beware religious conservatives . . .” 
19 Westmoreland issued this statement on September 8, 2008: “I’ve never heard that 
term [uppity] used in a racially derogatory sense. It is important to note that the 
dictionary deﬁnition of ‘uppity’ is ‘affecting an air of inﬂated self-esteem – snobbish.’ 
That’s what we meant by uppity when we used it in the mill village where I grew up.” 
20 At the same time Clementson is pointing out the bigotry implicit in calling an African 
American “articulate,” she points out: 
With the ballooning size of the black middle and upper class, qualities in 
blacks like intelligence, eloquence – the mere ability to string sentences together 
with tenses intact – must at some point become as unremarkable to whites 
as they are to blacks. 
(Clementson 2007; emphasis added) 
This narrow deﬁnition of acceptable English (with tenses intact) is one that is echoed 
by other prominent African Americans and undercuts the primary argument, though 
the writer seems unaware of this.

The workplace and the judicial system 
I am from India. Now a US citizen and live in USA for about 24 years. I had my 
University education in USA. After my PhD and 6 years of employment now I am 
unemployed and unable to secure a job. Recently I applied for a job . . . The employer 
called, told me that it was a prescreening interview. She told me she likes everything 
about me, but she does not like my accent. She said, as a part of the job I need to do 
telephone interviews . . . She also said she called me ﬁrst, because she does not want 
to waste time . . . when it comes to hiring and promotion, my opportunity for advance-
ment is clearly based on my accent. 
Anonymous commenter, http://www.theworkbuzz.com, October 27, 2010 
I never thought about my accent much while I was living in Mississippi. My family 
had been there over 200 years . . . I moved to Texas and once again, my accent came 
under ﬁre. I even overheard my boss talking to a coworker one day; she said, “If I’d 
known how bad her accent was, I never would have hired her.”

The nutshell 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was designed (in part) to protect workers from dis-
crimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, age and other protected 
categories, or traits directly linked to those categories. The Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) provides directives on national origin discrimination 
with multiple examples of what does, and does not constitute discriminatory behavior 
(Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 2002). 
While employers will often go to great lengths to cloak discrimination, sometimes there 
is direct evidence as in the case of Sergio Fonseca, a native of Guatemala and a native 
speaker of English, who sued his employer for discrimination on the basis of national 
origin. In 2004, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit found Fonseca’s case 
had merit, in part because of evidence like this: 
Fonseca went to tell [his supervisor] Peterson about a problem with the new computer 
system. Peterson was familiar with the problem, and Fonseca spoke clearly, but 
Peterson pretended not to understand Fonseca. Fonseca repeated himself more than 
once while Peterson laughed at him and mocked his accent and repetition. 
(Fonseca v. Sysco 2004)

THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
More often employers who are actually guilty of discriminatory practices will try to prove 
to the court that they had a legal and reasonable motivation for their actions. This is where 
the courts become complicit. 
The Civil Rights Act 
With the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (Pub. L. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241), some types 
of discrimination in the workplace have been illegal under Title VII. In broad terms, Title 
VII makes it illegal to deny a person employment, promotion or workplace advantages 
(beneﬁts, use of facilities). The scope of the law is limited to protected categories (also 
referred to as classes) which are: race, color, national origin, sex, or religion. This pro-
tection extends to associations, which means simply this: You cannot refuse to hire Asians, 
nor can you refuse to hire someone who is married or otherwise interacts with Asians. 
Title VII also acknowledges those characteristics or traits that are inextricably linked 
to protected categories. For example, an employer cannot ﬁre an employee for wearing a 
head covering that is required by his or her religion. This would apply to a Muslim female 
who wears a hijab, or a Jewish male who wears a yarmulke.1 Nor can an employer 
discriminate against an employee or applicant on the basis of stereotypes and assumptions, 
even if they are not factually true. 
In the case of racial discrimination,2 “It is clearly forbidden by Title VII to refuse on 
racial grounds to hire someone because your customers or clients do not like his race” 
(Matsuda 1991: 1376).3 Similarly, a qualiﬁed person may not be rejected on the basis of 
linguistic traits linked to a protected category. In contrast to racial discrimination, however, 
an employer has some latitude in matters of language: “[a]n adverse employment decision 
may be predicated upon an individual’s accent when – but only when – it interferes 
materially with job performance” (Civil Rights Act of 1964, §701 et seq., 42 U.S.C.A. 
§2000e et seq.). The problem, as we’ll see, is the lack of parameters. For example, what 
does “materially” mean in this context? 
The EEOC released updated Compliance Manual for national origin discrimination in 
2002, which addresses the issue of accent directly: 
Linguistic characteristics are closely related to national origin, and basing employment 
decisions on a qualiﬁed individual’s foreign accent or limited ability to speak English 
may constitute national origin discrimination. Not all employment decisions based 
on linguistic characteristics will violate Title VII, however. The EEOC guidelines 
state, for example, that a business with a diverse clientele may lawfully assign work 
based on an employee’s ability to speak a foreign language. In addition, an employ-
ment decision based on a foreign accent will not violate Title VII if the individual’s 
accent materially interferes with his or her ability to perform a job. For example, if 
effective communication in English is required to perform a job and an individual’s 
accent materially interferes with the ability to communicate in English, rejecting the 
individual for the job because of the accent would not violate Title VII. 
(Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 2002) 
District courts have sometimes “shown some deference to the EEOC guidelines or have 
at least used the guidelines to help inform their analyses” but at the same time the courts 
are free to ignore the guidelines and have sometimes simply denied their relevance 
(Robinson 2008: 1528). A court that takes such a stance is making it easier for an employer

----- Page 176 (native) -----
the court that the decisions made were not discriminatory: 
By demonstrating that the individual’s English language skills were insufﬁcient to meet 
the employer’s needs (Cutler 1985; Matsuda 1991; Oppenheimer 2010; Robinson 
2008; The Legal Aid Society 2009; Vertreace 2010). 
By establishing a bona ﬁde occupational qualiﬁcation (BFOQ). The BFOQ is the more 
difficult case for the employer. The path taken depends on which of two different 
theories of liability is used. Disparate treatment, in which proof of discriminatory 
intent is crucial, requires a BFOQ defense; for disparate impact, in which such proof 
is not required, the employer must establish only business necessity: 
The Plaintiff makes out a prima facie case by showing that the employer’s 
selection device has a substantially adverse impact on his protected group [. . .] 
it remains open to the plaintiff to show that “other . . . selection devices, without 
a similarly undesirable . . . effect, would also serve the employer’s legitimate 
interest[s].” 
(Cutler 1985: 1169) 
The employer must convince the court that there was a legitimate business necessity that 
precluded hiring the person in question. The trick is to find and document what legal 
scholars call “second generation discrimination” because “Trait discrimination of this sort 
is increasingly at the core of Title VII litigation” (Yuracko 2006). 
Unequal treatment may result from cognitive or unconscious bias, rather than delib-
erate, intentional exclusion. “Second generation” claims involve social practices and 
patterns of interaction among groups within the workplace that, over time, exclude no 
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
151 
to defend his or her decision not to hire or promote. The employer is required to convince 
dominant groups. Exclusion is frequently difficult to trace directly to intentional, 
discrete actions of particular actors, and may sometimes be visible only in the aggregate. 
(Sturm 2001: 460)4 
In terms of language-focused discrimination, Title VII has one large limitation: Under 
the law as it currently stands, only those language traits tied to a national origin outside 
the U.S. are covered. If a person from Sweden, Thailand or South Africa believes he or 
she has been discriminated against on the basis of accent, the EEOC provides advice and 
legal assistance. A person from Appalachia, on the other hand, would have no recourse 
under Title VII. Appalachian English cannot be identiﬁed as originating outside the U.S. 
in any way that would satisfy the courts. 
There is little consistency in the way the courts approach issues of communication and 
accent. One assumes that the legal system is unbiased, and sometimes there is evidence of 
that. Just as often, however, the courts are willing to put their own beliefs and language 
ideologies ﬁrst, even when those beliefs are directly contradicted by expert testimony (see 
especially Fragante, below). 
In the current day it is hard to imagine a judge or jury simply refusing to believe 
testimony from a geneticist, biochemist, or DNA expert. But language is deceptively 
approachable, and everyone who has reached a certain level of education feels empowered. 
As we will see in the Kahakua case, a judge may choose to believe one expert over another 
simply because one of them provides an opinion that very closely matches his own personal 
opinions.

----- Page 177 (native) -----
152 
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
Rarely do the courts explore the meaning of the word “communication,” nor are there 
any widely accepted and used methodologies to assess the communication demands of a 
given job in a non-prejudicial way. 
The legal process5 
Alleged language-focused national origin discrimination cases usually begin when an 
individual ﬁles a complaint with the EEOC (or a similar agency on a state or local level). 
The employee may then ﬁle a civil action in the trial courts, in which he or she claims that 
civil liberties (as set out in the federal statutes known as the Civil Rights Act of 1964) have 
been violated. 
In some instances, these cases are brought to the courts not by the individual or group 
of individuals with the same complaint, but by a private agency acting for the injured party, 
such as the ACLU, or by a government agency, such as the EEOC. This action may be 
initiated at the state level, as many states have adopted civil liberties legislation patterned 
on the federal statutes.6 
An individual claiming language-focused discrimination must ﬁrst prove a prima facie 
case of disparate treatment in four steps: 
1 
establishment of identiﬁable national origin; 
2 
proof of application for a job for which he or she was qualiﬁed, and for which the 
employer was seeking applicants; 
3 
that he or she was rejected in spite of adequate qualiﬁcations; and 
4 
that after such rejection, the job remained open and the employer continued to seek 
applicants with the Plaintiff’s qualiﬁcations. 
After a prima facie case has been established, the burden of proof shifts to the employer, 
who must convince the court that there was a legitimate reason to ﬁre or turn away the 
person with the accent. If the employer does this, the burden shifts back to the Plaintiff to 
show that the purported reason for the action was pretext (that is, an excuse) for invidious 
discrimination. The Plaintiff must prove that the employer was motivated by discriminatory 
reasons, or otherwise prove that the reason given by the employer is simply not believable 
(Civil Rights Act of 1964, €701 et seq., 42 U.S.C.A. 2000e et seq.). Figure 9.1 shows the 
number of Title VII language focused complaints tried in the period 1972–1994. 
Discrimination in the workplace 
In an excellent study of language and discrimination in the workplace in Great Britain, 
Roberts, Davies and Jupp (1992) provide numerous examples of discrimination focused 
on language, and directed toward ethnic and racial minorities. No such systematic and 
well-documented study exists for workers in the United States. The evidence of dis-
crimination provided here is limited to speciﬁc instances which have found their way into 
the legal system and represents what is most likely a very small fraction of the whole. 
Here the discussion is based on 25 language-focused national origin discrimination cases 
that were heard in the federal and state courts and by the EEOC between 1972 and 1993, 
with exceptions as noted.7 More recent cases are brought into the discussion, but they are 
not included in any statistics seen here. In some of the cases included, both racial and

national origin discrimination were at issue. In most of the cases, accent, language use and 
communication ﬁgured prominently in the testimony, argumentation, discussion and ﬁnal 
opinion.8 Table 9.1 provides an overview. 
How widespread is language-focused discrimination? The General Accounting Ofﬁce 
of the United States Government (GAO GGD 90-62 Employer Sanctions: 27) conducted 
a carefully designed statistical study of a stratiﬁed random sample of employers nationwide, 
and reported that 10 percent of their sample, or 461,000 companies employing millions 
of persons, openly, if naively admit that they “discriminated on the basis of a person’s 
foreign appearance or accent” (ibid.: 38). In hiring audits speciﬁcally designed to detect 
discrimination on the basis of accent (telephone inquiries about advertised jobs), such 
discrimination was found to be prevalent (ibid.).9 This behavior was documented again in 
Carroll v. Elliott Personnel Services (1985), when an employment agency receptionist was 
directed by her manager to screen all persons inquiring over the telephone: to those who 
did not “speak right,” the job was closed. Carroll was also told to make notations about 
the caller’s speech and accent. Carroll sued on the grounds that her employer was com-
pelling her to break the law, and she won her case. 
There are a number of possible reasons for the low number of documented cases, some 
of which include: 
employers who discriminate may do so in a sophisticated and subtle way; 
the persons discriminated against are so accustomed to this treatment that they no 
longer react; 
if they are aware of the treatment, they may not know that they have legal recourse, 
or how to pursue it;

complaints are handled internally or mediated by an outside party, and resolved before 
litigation becomes necessary. 
Of course, many discriminated against on the basis of language may not ﬁnd anything 
surprising or wrong about that fact. This is, after all, not the only society in the world that 
promotes a standard language ideology. 
The bulk of the burden seems to fall, predictably, on the disenfranchised and the 
unassimilated. Cutler claims that the manner of enforcement of Title VII “permits an 
employer to reject qualiﬁed applicants of a particular national origin as long as he hires 
more assimilated applicants of the same origin instead” (Cutler 1985: 1164). 
Once on the stand in a courtroom, what do the employers offer in the way of excuse? 
The approaches taken by defendants range from the naively and openly discriminatory to 
the understated: 
Sophia Poskocil, originally of Colombia and a native Spanish speaker, was repeatedly 
passed over for a position in the Roanoke, Virginia, school system. This despite the fact

----- Page 180 (native) -----
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
155 
that she had an excellent education at a U.S. college, solid experience and outstanding 
letters of reference. Poskocil sued under Title VII: 
During the trial, evidence was introduced that the school district based its decision 
not to hire Poskocil on student evaluations. Students in Poskocil’s Northside High 
School class complained that Poskocil was difficult to understand because of her 
foreign accent. In their evaluations, students wrote, among other things, that the 
“instructor [Sophia Poskocil] barely spoke English, [and] was hard to understand.” 
Ultimately, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the school 
district, stating that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the county discriminated 
against her. What is disturbing about the case is that Poskocil was not applying to 
teach a high school English class, which might have made the students’ complaints 
more relevant, but rather Poskocil was applying to teach Spanish classes. Moreover, 
it appears that no one at her trial had a difﬁcult time understanding her. 
(Smith 2005: 253) 
In Willamina, Oregon, the postmaster was harassed and threatened with physical 
violence: 
Galdamez began to receive hostile comments from customers and other residents 
based on her race, accent, and national origin almost immediately upon taking the 
job [of postmaster] in Willamina. Several customers, including the mayor, expressed 
displeasure with having a Hispanic postmaster or criticized her accented English. One 
local newspaper referred to Galdamez’s “thick accent from her native Honduras” in 
explaining that she had not “made friends in some quarters” and was the object of an 
ouster campaign.

walk away, unable to understand. Mr. M. refused to attribute such incidents to Mr. 
Dercach’s accent, but offered no other explanation. He said they just couldn’t 
understand him “like normal people with normal language.”

not recall ever having talked to Rodriguez.

THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
Hawai’i: 
The ability to speak clearly is one of the most important skills . . . we felt the applicants 
selected would be better able to work in our ofﬁce because of their communication 
skills. 
(Fragante v. Honolulu 1989) 
So the court has before it a Plaintiff who claims that his or her basic civil liberties have 
been violated, and a Defendant – an employer – who claims the right to make appropriate 
business decisions. How do courts handle this conﬂict? What factors, legal and otherwise, 
play a role in the decision making process? 
In some cases one must assume that sometimes a Plaintiff will claim language-focused 
discrimination when in fact none has taken place – or there is insufficient evidence to 
persuade the court that there has been discrimination. It also happens that a Plaintiff 
establishes that she has been discriminated against, but the laws and court system are 
complicated, and what looks like a minor slip could result in an early dismissal or the lack 
of remedy for the Plaintiff. Sometimes it is hard to determine, on the basis of case summaries 
available from legal databases, whether the failure was factual, technical or ideological. 
There may be clear evidence of language-focused discrimination which the court 
overlooks because there is, in addition, a bona ﬁde reason to deny employment. However, 
as Cutler points out, employers are favorably predisposed to potential employees who are 
“like” them, and less disposed toward potential employees who are “unlike” them. Because 
the courts fail to recognize this fact, and refuse to reject the validity of the personal 
preference rationale, “Title VII becomes a statute which, at best, coerces job applicants 
to assimilate and, at worst, keeps them jobless” (Cutler 1985: 1166). 
I proceed from the point at which the Plaintiff and the Defendant have made their cases, 
and the court must now decide whose argumentation better fulﬁlls the requirements set 
forth by the law. It is possible to trace the inﬂuence of the standard ideology through much 
of the court’s deliberations. 
In the case summaries below, there are examples of successful and unsuccessful Title 
VII language trait-based complaints. The chapter concludes with an overview of the cases 
and the way ideology has interfered (or failed to interfere) in the legal process. 
Selected court cases10 
Kahakua v. Friday 
James Kahakua’s story is a good place to start, for reasons that will be clear shortly. In 
Chapter 12, the sociolinguistic complexities of living in Hawai’i will be discussed in more 
depth. For the moment, the fact that James Kahakua is a native of Hawai’i and bilingual 
speaker of English and Hawai’ian Creole English (HC) is not as simple a statement as it 
might seem on the surface. Even the phrase “a native of Hawai’i” is fraught with ambiguity, 
because it raises the sensitive subject of native Hawai’ian rights and self-determination. 
What it means to be Hawai’ian, who has the right to call themselves Hawai’ian, how to 
interpret terms like haole,11 these are questions that are hotly debated. So we return to Mr. 
Kahakua, a university-trained meteorologist with 20 years of experience. Kahakua applied 
for a promotion which would have required him to read prepared weather reports on the 
radio. It is important to note that these reports would have been prepared ahead of time, 
so that editing could be undertaken as necessary.12

----- Page 182 (native) -----
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
157 
Likewise, it is important to remember that as a life-long native, Kahakua was absolutely 
prepared to use the longest and most difﬁcult placenames (such as ‘Alala¯-keiki, ‘Ale-nui-
ha¯ha¯, Hanaka¯pı¯’ai) crucial to talking about the weather, and very difﬁcult for a mainlander 
to learn. 
Mr. Kahakua was not given this promotion. His employer found him unqualiﬁed to do 
so, not because he is incapable of reading, but because as a bilingual English–HC speaker, 
he has an Hawai’ian accent. 
Subsequently, Mr. Kahakua sued his employer under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 
on the basis of language traits linked to national origin, and he lost. He lost because the 
judge, who was not a native of Hawai’i, believed that it was reasonable to require that radio 
announcers speak “Standard American English” (which was not deﬁned explicitly) and 
furthermore, the judge added that “there is no race or physiological reason why Kahakua 
could not have used Standard American English pronunciations” (Matsuda 1991: 1345). 
The speech pathologist who testiﬁed on behalf of the employer gave the judge ammunition 
when she was questioned during the trial: “I urgently recommend [Mr. Kahakua] seek 
professional help in striving to lessen this handicap . . . Pidgin can be controlled. And if an 
individual is totally committed to improving, professional help on a long-term basis can 
produce results” (emphasis added) (ibid.). 
This is a very good – if very disturbing – example of how people think about language: 
if we want to, if we try hard enough, we can acquire a perfect language, one which is clean, 
pure, free of variation and unpleasant social associations. Language which is not perfect 
is a handicap, and does not have to be accepted. 
The judge and the speech therapist are sure of themselves: they stake their professional 
reputations on their opinions and pronouncements about language in general and Mr. 
Kahakua’s language in particular. The court has decreed that Mr. Kahakua could, if he 
wished, comply with what they see as the reasonable request of his employer. 
Kahakua’s attorney disagreed, as any linguist would disagree: Mr. Kahakua can no more 
comply with the demand that he completely lose his native phonology – his accent – than 
he could comply with an order of the judge to grow four inches, or, and much more 
controversially, than it would be possible for him to change the color of his skin. The 
complexity of the relationship between language, ethnicity and ideology in Hawai’i 
has only been touched upon. The Fragante case, also in Hawai’i, will make some things 
clearer. 
Fragante v. City & County of Honolulu13 
One commonly heard myth or misconception about Hawai’i is that of the paradise without 
racism, where everyone is equal and visitors are welcomed and treated well. In fact, 
Hawai’i’s history is rife with ethnic and race conflicts that continue to the present day 
(Okamura 2008; Roher 2005a, 2005b). 
In April 1981, at the age of 60, Manuel Fragante emigrated from the Philippines to 
Hawaii. While Fragante speaks a number of the languages of the Philippines, his entire 
education had been conducted in English, including his university degree in law. For most 
of his adult life he was in the military; as a younger man he volunteered to serve on 
the American side in the Vietnam War. He continued his military training in the U.S. at 
various army installations and military schools, and his grades and evaluations were 
consistently excellent.

THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
His daughter had settled in Hawai’i, and so Fragante moved, took up residence and 
eventually became a naturalized citizen. Because he wanted to stay busy and supplement 
his income, he began to look for work. 
In late 1981 he replied to a newspaper ad and applied for an open entry level Civil 
Service Clerk position with the City of Honolulu’s Division of Motor Vehicles and 
Licensing. Clerks at this level handle ﬁling, process mail, act as cashier, provide infor-
mation, and order supplies. Of the 721 applicants who took the written civil service 
examination, Fragante scored first in subjects that included vocabulary, grammar, and 
spelling. This ranking assured that he would move forward in the interview process. 
A subset of the original applicants came in for an oral interview with two administrators. 
During the interview, the assistant licensing administrator repeatedly underscored the 
chaotic atmosphere of the DMV, how demanding the public could be, and how important 
communication was. 
Both interviewers gave Fragante a negative evaluation, noting his very heavy accent. 
He was not offered employment. Later they would testify that they found Fragante hard 
to understand, and that his accent was the only reason he had been declined. 
Fragante pursued administrative remedies without success, and then ﬁled a claim under 
Title VII against the City and County of Honolulu. His complaint alleged that he had 
been discriminated against because of his accent. In a letter to his attorney, he expressed 
his surprise and outrage: 
I have traveled to Europe and South America and managed to communicate effectively 
in English with strangers who hardly spoke the tongue. How, then, could certain 
English-speaking interviewers of the City government claim, or pretend, I could not 
be understood?! Outside that interview office, I never encountered any commu-
nication problem with anybody in Hawai’i or on the mainland. 
(Matsuda 1991: 1335) 
The district court did not question any of the decisions made by the defendant, and based 
on their own interview with Fragante, decided that he was “hampered by his accent or 
manner of speaking.” 
This is another example of how courts are willing to depend on their own often factually 
incorrect or biased understanding of language issues: 
Fragante argues the district court erred in considering “listener prejudice” as a 
legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for failing to hire. We ﬁnd, however, that the 
district court did not determine Defendants refused to hire Fragante on the basis that 
some listeners would “turn off” a Filipino accent. The district court after trial noted 
that: “Fragante, in fact, has a difﬁcult manner of pronunciation.” 
(Fragante v. Honolulu 1989) 
The judge rejected the testimony of the linguist who testiﬁed about Hawai’ian Creole in 
support of the plaintiff. The linguist, the judge stated, was not an expert in speech (Matsuda 
1991: 1345–1346).14 
People in the judicial system do not leave their experiences or culture behind when they 
go to work. The guards at the door, the ofﬁce clerks, the judges – everyone has a personal 
history through which all new information is ﬁltered, no matter how dedicated each person 
is to doing their job well. In Fragante, the issue of racism might have been raised, but there

----- Page 184 (native) -----
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
159 
is no trace of it in any of the published documents about the case. It seems as though the 
courts are unaware of racism within a particular group, as here, where one Asian group 
dominated and discriminated against other Asian ethnicities (Anheta 2006; Kim et al. 2008; 
Okamura 2010; Tiongson et al. 2006). In Hawai’i, there is a long history of discrimination 
toward Filipinos, particularly by other Asians.15 
Fragante and Kahakua have something in common, beyond the fact that they both lost 
their court cases. Filipinos and native Hawaiians tend to be poor, and both groups are low 
in social prestige and (for the most part) political power. National origin discrimination 
linked to language trait is hard to prove, but in some contexts it would seem to be 
impossible. 
The courts have stated that “[t]here is nothing improper about an employer making an 
honest assessment of the oral communications skills of a candidate for a job when such 
skills are reasonably related to job performance” (Fragante 1989). Matsuda calls this the 
doctrinal puzzle of accent and antidiscrimination law: Title VII disallows discrimination on 
the basis of accent when it correlates to national origin, but it allows employers to dis-
criminate on the basis of job ability. Employers claim that “accent” impedes communi-
cation, and thereby poses a valid basis for rejection; the courts are especially receptive to 
this argument (Matsuda 1991:1348 ff.). 
In an interesting twist to Fragante’s story, he eventually did take a job as a statistician 
with the State of Hawai’i after he lost the Title VII case. Ironically his job involved 
conducting telephone interviews, further giving credence to the argument that the city 
misjudged the degree to which his accent would interfere with his performance (ibid.). 
Akouri v. State of Florida Department of Transportation 
George Akouri, a licensed engineer with many qualifications and years of experience, 
applied for and received a job as a maintenance contract engineer with the Florida 
Department of Transportation (DOT). During his six years with DOT, Akouri applied 
for three promotions to supervisory positions, and was turned down three times. In 2000 
he ﬁled a charge of discrimination on the basis of national origin with the EEOC. In 2001, 
he was ﬁred. 
Direct evidence of discrimination is increasingly rare as managers become more aware 
of how Title VII works. In this case, however, the administrators seemed to be completely 
unaware of Title VII, because when Akouri asked why he had not been promoted, the 
supervisor answered candidly. He explained that the position involved supervising a crew 
of men who were Anglo, and that white men would not take orders from him, a foreigner, 
particularly as he had an accent. 
The jury found that Akouri had been discriminated against and awarded him back pay 
and damages. DOT filed an appeal with the district court and lost – Akouri’s claim of 
discrimination stood fast. However, the court then reduced the award of $700,000 to 
nominal damages, and denied Akouri’s motion for a new trial. 
Often at this point in the appeals process, the issues have to do not with the original 
charges, but with procedure. In this case, two appeals courts decided that Akouri had not 
provided enough documentation to warrant the back-pay award: “the record is devoid 
of any evidence of [Akouri’s] actual salary at the time he was employed by the DOT. 
Thus, there was no ﬁgure from which the jury could have reasonably calculated net lost 
wages.”

160 
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
Note that in this case, evidence was enough to validate Akouri’s claims, but not enough 
to convince the court that he was entitled to back pay. More generally important: the court 
did not direct the Defendant to take any action to correct or improve their procedures for 
hiring and promoting. 
Kyomugisha v. Clowney and the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee16 
In the early 1990s, Florence Kyomugisha left her native Uganda for the U.S., where she 
enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee as a graduate student in political science. 
Ms. Kyomugisha was a native speaker of Runyankole and Luganda, indigenous lan-
guages of Uganda, as well as of English.17 She attended Makerere University in Kampala 
before applying to the graduate program at the University of Wisconsin. 
As a student, Kyomugisha began employment in UW-M’s Ofﬁce of Afﬁrmative Action 
and Equal Opportunity. Over the course of the next four years, three different supervisors 
were so satisﬁed with her performance that she was promoted to Administrative Program 
Specialist. Then a new Assistant Chancellor for Equal Opportunity was hired. 
In the next few months, Assistant Chancellor Charmaine Clowney made numerous and 
documented demeaning and hostile remarks about Kyomugisha’s Ugandan accent, 
excluded her from making oral presentations that she had been making successfully for 
four years, and restricted her responsibilities in other ways. 
After complaints and counter-complaints to the Chancellor and to the federal Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, Clowney issued notice that Kyomugisha’s 
employment contract would not be renewed. 
Florence Kyomugisha lost her job at the University of Wisconsin in part because of 
alleged communication difﬁculties with her supervisor, Ms. Clowney18 and so Kyomugisha 
ﬁled charges against Clowney and the university under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. 
The official complaint filed with the court asserted that “the defendant Charmaine P. 
Clowney was intentionally motivated by prohibited animus based on national origin and 
acted in bad faith and with malice and in derogation of her duties and contrary to the 
[laws].19 
Kyomugisha believed that Clowney was claiming accent as a communicative hindrance 
as an excuse (or in legal terms, as pretext) to ﬁre her, because Clowney disliked African 
nationals and did not want to work with somebody from Uganda. 
The attorney representing Kyomugisha questioned Clowney in a deposition (testimony 
taken under oath as part of the preparation for a trial). While Clowney is herself an 
attorney, she was also represented by counsel from the university, who was present. 
In the following excerpt from the deposition, “attorney” refers Kyomugisha’s lawyer. 
Please note that he uses the word animus rather than prejudice, racism, or some other more 
incendiary term. 
Attorney: You know about discriminatory animus from your professional preparation 
in the ﬁeld of afﬁrmative action and discrimination law; isn’t that correct? You 
were responsible for doing the investigations of discrimination at the university, 
and you need to know what the laws about that, correct? 
Clowney: Yes, sir. 
Attorney: And you know about the sociology of discrimination, right? 
Clowney: Yes.

----- Page 186 (native) -----
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
161 
Attorney: And you would agree that the process of communication between two 
individuals involves a degree of burden sharing between the two individuals for 
purposes of making each other understood, correct? 
Clowney: Sometimes. It depends on the nature of the two individuals. I would agree 
that the burden is more on an investigator to be understood in a university 
community than employees. The burden is more so on the professional than the 
nonprofessional. 
Attorney: Now, I’m speaking of two people who speak with each other, who have 
divergent accents. You agree that you have an accent, correct? 
Clowney: At times I might. I don’t know if I do or not; you tell me. 
Attorney: Well, isn’t it true that all people have an accent of one kind or another? 
Clowney: Not all people, some people. My mother is a schoolteacher and she doesn’t 
necessarily have an accent. 
Attorney: Well, do you think somebody from another part of the country who speaks 
with a different intonation would say that that person in fact has an accent? 
Clowney: Possibly, yes. 
Attorney: And communication between two such people involves the acceptance of a 
certain responsibility for burden sharing between each other in order to effectuate 
communication; isn’t that correct? 
Clowney: It can. It depends on the relationship between the two individuals. 
Attorney: One of the factors in that relationship that could make the communication 
difﬁcult is when one individual refuses to accept burden, a burden in connection 
with effectuating comprehensibility; isn’t that correct? 
Clowney: How about the burden on the other person to go and take courses and study 
and to be understood as well. What about – why should the burden – I also 
understand diversity, but why should the burden be on the recipient rather than, 
I mean, if you look at modern-day diversity studies, we’d be here all day. There’s 
a double burden; there’s a dual burden. I’ll – I’ll say there’s a dual burden. 
Attorney: Isn’t it true that in some conversations where one person has a racial animus 
of one type or a national origin animus of one type that person refuses to accept 
a burden, any burden for effectuating the communication and thereby make – 
makes the allegation that the person is incomprehensible? 
Clowney: I’m not going to answer that. I’m not an expert on communications skills. 
I’ve written papers on communication skills and racial animus. I can’t say that. 
You’re – you’re asking me to draw inferences here and I can’t say that. There are 
people I know that are trained who don’t have any kind of animus; and if they 
can’t understand someone, they get frustrated, and then have nothing to do with 
race, sex, religion, whatever. But the bottom line is that, you know, it’s – you 
have to listen a little bit carefully, but, you know. 
Attorney: Do you feel like you accepted your portion of the burden in trying to 
understand Florence’s oral communications? 
Clowney: Yes. 
Attorney: Whether you feel that you accepted your portion of the burden to com-
prehend what Florence was saying to you when she was orally communicating 
with you? 
Clowney: Yes, I do. 
Attorney: Do you feel that you made a reasonable good faith effort to understand 
Florence?

----- Page 187 (native) -----
162 
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
Clowney: Yes, I do. 
Attorney: Is it your testimony that notwithstanding that effort that was not enough 
and you still had oral communication problems with Florence? 
Clowney: Yes, I do. 
The fact that Clowney was both an attorney and the Assistant Chancellor for Equal 
Opportunity in charge of the ofﬁce investigating claims of discrimination might seem to 
be ironic. It is also a sobering example of the reach of standard language ideology. 
Subsequent to this deposition, the university decided to settle this case and so it never 
came to trial. Ms. Kyomugisha received compensatory damages, back pay, and the 
attorney’s costs she had incurred. The university’s lawyers did not disclose the reasons the 
university decided to offer a settlement. 
Ms. Kyomugisha was knowledgeable about the law, and she had the strength of will and 
resources necessary to pursue her legal rights. Her story ends well, but many others – most 
others, I would claim – do not. Everyday individuals are reminded that the language they 
speak marks them as less-than-good-enough. Most don’t realize that they have rights, or 
that there are organizations who will help making sure those rights are protected. Some 
might know that they have a legal claim, but be afraid to risk retribution. 
Then there are those whose claims are bound to fail, because the ideology of the 
workplace and that of the court work together to make sure that they do. 
Dercach v. Indiana Department of Highways 
Anthony Dercach was born in the Ukraine and raised in Venezuela where he attended 
Spanish-speaking schools. He moved to the United States at age 19, and had at that point 
no English language skills. 
Dercach was hired by the highway department as a maintenance worker, and after three 
years was promoted to crew leader at the recommendation of his foreman, because of his 
ability to drive a Mack truck. Two years later, after a series of resignations, Dercach served 
as acting, temporary unit foreman. The department then advertised the unit foreman 
position, received 12 applications, and set up interviews. The person given the unit 
foreman position had also been a crew leader, but had less seniority than Dercach. 
Two people on the interview committee testiﬁed that they chose not to recommend 
Dercach for promotion to unit foreman because he had had problems with paperwork 
and because he had had problems communicating with others. One of the interviewers 
testiﬁed that workers would ask Mr. Dercach what he wanted them to do, and then simply 
walk away, unable to understand. Mr. Moser refused to attribute such incidents to Mr. 
Dercach’s accent, but offered no other explanation. He said they just couldn’t understand 
him “like normal people with normal language.” 
The plaintiff repeatedly denied that Dercach’s accent was an issue in their promotion 
decision; the court did not ﬁnd those denials to be credible. The court recognized that 
Dercach had indeed been discriminated against on the basis of national origin, but they 
still found for the plaintiff, because there was one credible reason: Dercach had a very 
limited ability to read and write English, skills that were necessary for the job. 
During [Dercach’s] cross-examination, he was shown several of his requests for vacation 
leave; those requests had been ﬁlled out by Mr. Dercach’s wife or foreman. Asked to locate 
the request for vacation for a trip to Hawai’i, he was unable to do so. Asked to read aloud

----- Page 188 (native) -----
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
163 
a story in USA Today, he was unable to do so. Asked to read aloud a headline from the 
same newspaper, he was unable to do so. Asked to read aloud an exhibit critical of his 
paperwork, he was unable to do so. 
All witnesses testified that the highway department Field Operations Handbook for 
Foremen was an essential manual for unit foremen; Dercach himself testiﬁed that it was 
“the Bible” for unit foremen. While he was being questioned by the Defendant’s attorneys 
he was asked to ﬁnd the performance standard for “full-width litter pickup.” After several 
minutes of searching, he then pointed to the performance standard for “ﬂushing bridges.” 
In Dercach, the court felt that blatant discrimination could not mitigate the fact that 
the Plaintiff, while hard working and knowledgeable, was unable to read or write English 
and because the job required close work with a written code book and the ability to write 
multiple reports on a weekly basis, the court found for the defendant. It was not in the 
court’s power to penalize the employer for blatant national origin discrimination, and in 
fact, the highway department got away with violating the Civil Rights Act. 
Two years after Dercach’s trial, the Supreme Court provided guidelines on how to rule 
on mixed-motive Title VII cases. Supreme Court held that in such cases the employer/ 
defendant can sidestep liability by proving that even if the illegitimate reason for the 
employer’s action were eliminated, the employer would have made the same decision on 
the basis of the non-discriminatory reason alone. Congress stepped in on this ruling, and 
changed the law so that it is enough for the Plaintiff to prove that the discriminatory reason 
was a motivating factor. In such cases, the Plaintiff could sue for attorney’s fees, and an 
injunction on the employer which demanded a change in policy and discriminatory 
practice (Smith 2005: 242). 
Hasan v. Contra Costa County 
Saed Hasan came to the U.S. from Palestine to study engineering. At the University of 
South Dakota he maintained a 4.0 GPA for both his undergraduate and graduate degrees. 
After three years working as a civil engineer on a variety of projects, he applied for the 
position of entry-level engineer with Contra Costa County, California. 
Hasan went through the interview process, and in the verbal portion ranked second in 
a ﬁeld of 344 applicants. There were four openings at the time, but Hasan was not offered 
work. He applied again in 1998, and this time ranked ﬁrst in the verbal portion of the 
interview. Again, he was not offered work. Over two years the county advertised a total 
of 12 openings for civil engineers with Hasan’s background and experience. One of those 
positions was never filled because the county interviewers were not satisfied with the 
candidates. The other 11 were ﬁlled with people who spoke English without a foreign 
accent. The Defendants admitted that, with one or two exceptions, Hasan appeared to be 
“demonstrably better qualiﬁed” than the engineers who were hired. 
After Hasan complained to Human Resources he met with Clifford Hansen, Deputy 
Director of Public Works. Hansen had been on both hiring committees, and in fact, hiring 
decisions were his responsibility alone. Hansen was quite straightforward in listing his 
reasons for rejecting Hasan. He stated that, “when it comes to choosing between a person 
who has an accent and a person who has no accent, he will choose the person who has no 
accent.” Hasan ﬁled a lawsuit. 
During discovery – the period before a case goes to trial in which both sides assemble 
evidence and work on strategy – Hasan’s attorneys requested access to the interview

----- Page 189 (native) -----

THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
committee’s written notes from the verbal interviews. The Defendants turned over only 
one set of notes, and claimed that notes of the other two people on the October 1997 
interview panel had been lost. Defendants also lost the envelope in which the notes were 
kept, and ﬁnally, they destroyed the tape recording of Hasan’s 1998 oral interview. 
Hasan’s attorneys hired a forensic documents examiner to look at the notes they did 
have. In the examiner’s professional opinion, a number of remarks had been written at a 
different time than the rest of the notes. All the notes added at a later time were negative, 
including “very difﬁcult to understand,” and “He talks way too much!” Hasan won his 
case; he was awarded back pay, damages and court costs. 
In some cases, the behavior of the Defendant and Defendant’s council damages whatever 
reasonable claims they might have had. In this case, the employer’s hiring and promotion 
practices were so blatantly discriminatory and their attitude so disdainful that they made 
it easier for the court to ﬁnd for the Plaintiff. The Defendants indulged in excessive delay 
tactics, which resulted in increased legal costs for Hasan and might have forced him to 
drop his suit, which he did not. The County then went on to appeal the award of court 
and legal costs, and was ﬁrmly slapped down by the appeals court. 
The trial court observed both parties over the course of the litigation, and speciﬁcally 
found that much of Hasan’s fee award could be attributed to the tactics of the County. 
The district court correctly applied the relevant law and was well within its discretion in 
determining both Hasan’s entitlement to the attorney’s fees and the amount ultimately 
awarded (Hasan, Decision of the Appeal from the United States District Court for the 
Northern District). 
Mandhare v. W.S. LaFargue Elementary School 
In 1965, at the age of 29, Sulochana Mandhare left her home in the Maharashtra region 
of India and came to the United States. At that point in her life, Ms. Mandhare – a native 
speaker of Marathi – had been studying English for almost 20 years.20 
Ms. Mandhare speaks in a soft voice and an English which is characterized by full vowels 
in unstressed syllables, distinctive intonation patterns, aspirated fricatives and stops, and 
a lack of distinction between initial /v/ and /w/. She is an intelligent and articulate woman, 
and she tells her story in a clear and completely comprehensible accented English (1994, 
personal communication). 
After some time in the U.S., Ms. Mandhare relates, she decided to continue her edu-
cation. She had arrived with undergraduate degrees in both liberal arts and education, but 
she returned to school and in 1972 completed a Master’s Degree in Education at New 
Orleans’s Loyola University; in 1979 she was certiﬁed as a school librarian after completing 
a program at Nichols State University. After working for one year as an elementary school 
librarian, Ms. Mandhare applied for and was given a job as a librarian at a school serving 
kindergarten through second grade in the Lafargue, Louisiana school district, for the 
1980–1981 school year. 
Ms. Mandhare talks about that year as happy and successful. Her responsibilities were 
to oversee the small library, read stories to the children and introduce them to using the 
resources, and she enjoyed this work. Therefore, when in April 1981 she was told that her 
contract would not be renewed because of her “heavy accent, speech patterns and grammar 
problems,” and in spite of her excellent skills as a librarian, she was stunned and angry. 
She investigated her options, and because she understood that the Civil Rights Act

THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
165 
prohibits national origin discrimination in the workplace, she ﬁled suit. This civil action 
was decided in Ms. Mandhare’s favor; the decision was reversed by the U.S. Court of 
Appeals in favor of the School Board. 
The ofﬁcial published summary of the case indicates that Ms. Mandhare then met with 
the Superintendent of Schools and on the advice of her supervisor requested a transfer to 
Thibodaux Junior High School, as a librarian.21 The School Board refused to reappoint 
Ms. Mandhare to this requested new position; testimony revealed that in their private and 
public deliberations, Ms. Mandhare’s foreignness and accent had been discussed. 
The trial court was very ﬁrm in this case: Ms. Mandhare had been discriminated against, 
and must prevail. However, the school’s initial decision that the Plaintiff could not teach 
young children because of her “heavy accent and speech patterns and grammar problems 
[which] prevented her from effectively communicating with primary school students” 
(Mandhare v. W.S. LaFargue Elementary School) was never questioned. The court took 
this claim on faith, and instead stated: 
Defendant’s contention that its legitimate reason for plaintiff’s termination or non-
appointment was that she had a communication problem because of her accent which 
prevented her from effectively communicating with primary school students is a 
feigned contention. Plaintiff was not being considered for a position which would 
require such communication. She was to be appointed librarian at a Junior High 
School, a position for which it was established that she was eminently qualiﬁed. 
(ibid.) 
It is important to remember that in this case, as in every other case discussed, no effort 
was made to make an objective assessment of the communication skills required for the 
job, the Plaintiff’s speech, the quality of her interaction with children or her intelligibility. 
The administrators found the Plaintiff’s accent difﬁcult; they decided not to reappoint her 
to her job in the grade school. This alone would have made them the focus of the court’s 
scrutiny (although not necessarily to the Plaintiff’s favor), but they redeemed themselves 
in the court’s eyes: They praised the Plaintiff’s industry and skill, and they went out of 
their way to locate a position in a school where her accent would neither offend nor 
inconvenience. The court could then focus on the School Board, which refused to give 
the Plaintiff this new job. The validity of the initial firing was never challenged. Thus 
everyone (except the School Board) was happy: the administrators were left intact as 
arbiters of the standard language ideology and lionized for their largesse; the court was 
not forced to challenge those educators on the factual basis for their decisions about 
appropriate language; Ms. Mandhare was to be reinstated as a librarian, in a junior high 
school. 
The question remains: were Ms. Mandhare’s civil rights protected? Were her best 
interests really served? Put more controversially, if Ms. Mandhare had been forbidden to 
ride public transportation, and challenged that restriction, should she then have been 
pleased to be offered alternate transportation, in the form of a bicycle, a Mercedes Benz, 
or another, different but equally functioning, bus? 
Ms. Mandhare did not really want the transfer to another school in a school district 
which had treated her so badly; she wanted back pay, which she did not get. Whether or 
not she would have been satisﬁed with the new position was never established, because 
the trial court decision was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit:

----- Page 191 (native) -----
166 
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
The district court’s determination that the Board had intentionally discriminated 
against Mandhare is clearly erroneous. The court focused on the wrong issue. It 
premised its conclusion on the Board’s refusal to follow LeBlanc’s recommendation 
that Mandhare be transferred to a junior high librarian position. That was not the 
issue as framed by the unamended pleadings and pre-trial order. Mandhare’s action 
asserted discrimination in the Board’s refusal to reemploy her as elementary school 
librarian, not their failure to create and transfer her to a junior high position. 
(Mandhare v. Lafargue Elementary School 1986: 5) 
The terrible irony of this reversal should be clear: Ms. Mandhare was originally protesting 
her dismissal on the basis of language-focused national origin discrimination; the judge 
in that ﬁrst case chose not to deal with that delicate issue, but to bypass it completely by 
focusing on the possibility of a position in another school. This gave the Appeal Court an 
out, which it took. The Appeal Court accused the Trial Court of focusing on the wrong 
issue and on that basis, it reversed the decision. 
In the end, both courts were satisﬁed to let the school administrators and School Board 
exclude on the basis of accent. In the analogy above, the ﬁrst court offered Ms. Mandhare 
a Mercedes-Benz when all she wanted to do was ride the bus. The Appeal Court said that 
the court had been wrong to offer Ms. Mandhare a Mercedes-Benz that didn’t exist and 
that no one was obliged to buy for her; it did not even question why she had been forced 
off the bus in the ﬁrst place, and it certainly didn’t offer her the opportunity to get back 
on, or compensate her for her trouble. 
The Appeal Court ﬁled the reversal on May 2, 1986, six years after Ms. Mandhare was 
denied renewal. The failure of the American judicial system caused her untold emotional 
anguish, financial difficulty, and was detrimental to her health. Today, she works as 
librarian for a private school in her home town of Thibodaux, but she will carry this 
experience with her for the rest of her life. 
Hou v. Pennsylvania, Department of Education, Slippery Rock 
State College 
Roger Hou, a native of China, is a naturalized citizen of the U.S. He came to the States 
to study in the early 1960s, became a citizen in 1965, and received a Ph.D. from the 
University of Indiana at Bloomington the next year. 
Hou was hired by Slippery Rock State College as an Associate Professor of Mathematics 
in 1969, and achieved tenure in the 1973–1974 school year. From 1972 to 1976, Hou 
applied for promotion to full professor. All six of his applications were denied. After his 
last unsuccessful application, Hou ﬁled a discrimination suit against the college.22 
If you recall, the first stage in a case like this is for the Plaintiff (Hou) to establish 
prima facie. Hou did reach that standard by showing that: (1) he is Asian, and thus a member 
of protected minority; (2) he was qualified for promotion in the years in question; 
(3) he was not promoted; and (4) Anglo faculty members had been promoted in the same 
period. 
At that point, the burden of proof shifted to the college, who had to prove that there 
were legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons not to promote Hou. The college did this by 
presenting evidence that Hou was a mediocre teacher, and further, that his mediocrity 
was due, at least in part, to his heavy accent.

Higher educational institutions were meant to be included within the scope of Title VII; 
nevertheless, the “trend in many courts has been to exercise minimal scrutiny of college 
and university employment practices, due, in large part, to the subjective factors on which 
many academic employment decision are based” (Hou 1983). There is considerable 
forbearance for the opinions put forth by school administration. In addition, the courts 
have shown reluctance to reverse higher education administrative decisions (ibid.). 
This deference for academic decision worked to Hou’s detriment. The judge pointed 
out that: “The issue of accent in a foreign-born person of another race is a concededly 
delicate subject when it becomes part of peer or student evaluations, since many people 
are prejudiced against those with accents” (Hou v. Pennsylvania Department of Education 
and Slippery Rock College 1983). 
The court then went on to approve the loophole used by the institution: 
We ﬁnd that comments about Dr. Hou’s accent, when made, were directed toward 
the legitimate issue of his teaching effectiveness. Teaching effectiveness, as the 
testimony at trial indicated, is an elusive concept [citations omitted] (evaluation of 
teaching ability [is] necessarily [a] matter of judgment). Teaching effectiveness does, 
however, include the ability to communicate the content of a discipline, a quality 
which should be carefully evaluated at any college or university. 
(ibid.) 
There was never any discussion of factual, non-prejudicial assessment of Dr. Hou’s 
communicative competence or intelligibility. The defense depended exclusively on 
anecdotal evidence provided by the defendant, and this satisﬁed the court. 
No steps were taken to isolate potentially legitimate reasons from the discriminatory 
ones. In an earlier chapter we looked at the studies which examined the way foreign accents 
are heard in an educational setting (Atagi 2003; Gluszek and Dovidio 2010; Kang and 
Rubin 2009; Katz et al. 2009).23 In a thorough review of studies on accent discrimination 
in education, Fought (2006) assembles the evidence to establish that the mind is capable 
of manufacturing accents where none exist, a phenomenon she calls accent hallucination. 
Her conclusion was that it is “possible for expectations about language and ethnicity to 
override the actual linguistic nature of an individual speech in the minds of hearers” (ibid.: 
Chapter 9.6). 
Kang and Rubin (2009) look at this from a slightly different but complementary angle. 
If Hou’s attorney had been aware of this academic work and presented it to the court, 
there might have been a closer examination of Hou’s situation. In the end it is possible 
that his lecture style was the problem, but the tone of some of the student evaluations of 
his performance makes it clear that without further research, there was no way to be sure 
Hou wasn’t being discriminated against on the basis of his national origin. 
Lawyers interested in Title VII language-focused cases have been debating how to 
ameliorate the kind of questionable evidence that was used by Hou’s employers: 
[T]he ﬁrst step in remedying this injustice and making it easier for plaintiffs to win 
foreign accent discrimination cases is to have courts vigilantly exclude customer 
preference arguments – such as the student evaluations in Poskocil – that operate as 
a partial defense to foreign accent discrimination and do nothing more than detract 
from a sound inquiry of whether the plaintiff’s English skills are sufﬁcient to perform 
his or her job satisfactorily. 
(Smith 2005: 234)

THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
Sparks v. Griffin and Edwards v. Gladewater Independent 
School District 
In some cases, language and accent are an issue and do stand in for a protected category, 
but there is more than one kind of discrimination going on. 
The Sparks and Edwards cases both had to do with the variety of English they spoke 
in the classroom, and in both cases the court focused primarily on racial discrimination. 
In many pages of correspondence on the matter of Ms. Sparks’ dismissal, the school 
administrator (Mr. Grifﬁn) commented only once on the language issue: “Mrs. Sparks has 
a language problem. She cannot help the negro dialect, but it is certainly bad for the 
children to be subjected to it all day” (Sparks v. Grifﬁn 1972). 
In Edwards v. Gladewater Independent School District (1978), the discussion of lan-
guage use is limited to general comments: “The plaintiff’s contract was not renewed 
allegedly because of complaints received from parents and students . . . Several complaints 
concerned students’ alleged inability to understand the plaintiff’s ‘Black accent.’” 
If the accent issue had never been raised in Sparks or Edwards, these Plaintiffs would 
still have won. This was fortunate for the courts, as it relieved them of the trouble of 
dealing with questions of language, dialect and accent and still more controversially, with 
the question of AAVE. In discussing the language-focused discrimination portion of 
Sparks, the court limited its comments to one short footnote: “With no disposition to be 
unkind, we question, based on the spelling and composition of the two letters . . . the 
ability of Mr. Grifﬁn to diagnose a ‘language-problem’” (Sparks v. Grifﬁn 442).24 
The letters written by Mr. Grifﬁn regarding the dismissal of Ms. Sparks and referred 
to by the court were, in fact, poorly written and contained many spelling and/or 
typographical errors; nevertheless, the court is clearly uncomfortable chiding an educator, 
in this case, an administrator with advanced degrees, in matters of language use: “with no 
disposition to be unkind.” More importantly, the court never addressed the content of 
Mr. Griffin’s complaint (Ms. Sparks’ “negro dialect” and its appropriateness for the 
classroom); it addressed only the superintendent’s qualiﬁcations to make judgments on 
that dialect, given his poor letter writing skills. 
Would the court have thought seriously about this criticism if Mr. Grifﬁn had written 
elegant, grammatically appropriate prose? If the attorney had argued that Ms. Sparks’ 
teaching effectiveness was compromised by her language use? It seems likely that the 
school systems could have found a line of argumentation which would have pleased the 
courts; they just failed to do so in this case. The court neatly sidestepped the “concededly 
delicate subject” of language-focused discrimination for Edwards as well: “The district 
court stated in its opinion that it was ‘apparent’ that the plaintiff could be easily understood 
and that there was no evidence the plaintiff made grammatical errors rendering her speech 
difﬁcult to understand” (ibid.). 
In these two cases, the schools were deservedly punished for racial discrimination; for 
language-focused discrimination, they were slapped on the wrist. 
It is worthwhile looking at how race and national origin intersect in cases involving 
persons of African origin. Figure 9.2 breaks down the nine examined language-focused 
cases which were ﬁled by such persons. 
The two successful cases were brought by African Americans, native speakers of English 
who also speak AAVE. The others were brought by persons who speak English as a second 
language. This is some indication that there are more negative feelings about persons who 
have recently immigrated from Africa than there is about U.S. residents who are native

Figure 9.2  Title VII cases won and lost by persons of African ancestry, by area of geographic 
origin, between 1975 and 1995 
speakers of English, even if the variety of English in question is stigmatized (see 
Kyomigusha v. Clowney). There is little work done on the way ethnic and national origin 
differences may cause strife within the African American community, but that such 
problems exist is a matter of record. 
Xieng v. Peoples National Bank of Washington 
How do some plaintiffs manage to avoid settlement, make it to court, and to win? Xieng 
provides the ultimate example of a successful case. 
Phanna Xieng is a Cambodian-American who worked for Peoples National Bank of 
Washington. Mr. Xieng was repeatedly denied a promotion although he had an excellent 
work history, high marks in his reviews, and had been ﬁlling in on the very position he 
applied for over an extended period of time. There were documented comments from his 
superiors concerning his accent as the primary stumbling block to his promotion. In this 
case, the court could not overlook the fact that Mr. Xieng could carry out the job he 
claimed he could do, in spite of his accent, precisely because he had already been 
performing well at the job. It might seem that being on the inside – already employed by 
the Defendant – provides an employee with a valid language-focused discrimination 
complaint with some strong evidence, but there are many similar cases in which promotion 
is denied. 
Is it the case, then, that the Plaintiff’s chances of winning a language-focused dis-
crimination case depend to the greatest degree on the integrity and objectivity of the judge 
hearing the trial? Unfortunately, it is not as easy as this. Below it will become clear that 
for some areas of employment, even the most open-minded of courts still are subject to 
the unwritten laws of a standard language ideology.

THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
Context 
In civil rights violations of the kind discussed here, courts are disposed to favor the 
employer, which makes it very difﬁcult for the Plaintiff to build a successful case. These 
cases fail for all kinds of reasons in a variety of combinations, ﬁve of which we have seen 
here: 
1  
Kahakua: Court declared Kahakua’s accent a handicap that he could overcome if he 
wanted to, and found he had not been discriminated against. 
2  
Fragante: Court refused to recognize the connection between foreign accent and 
national origin discrimination. 
3  
Dercach: Blatant language-focused national origin discrimination established, but the 
presence of a valid reason for non-promotion caused the court to rule for the 
employer. 
4  
Mandhare: Discrimination established, but faulty legal procedure resulted in a lack 
of remedy. 
5  
Hou: Court found no evidence of discrimination, but there was no independent or 
impartial evaluation of Hou’s communication skills. 
Employers point out that the decision-making process in business hiring and promotion 
is often unavoidably subjective in nature. The courts have supported them in this: 
It does not follow, though, that ethnic discrimination is the only explanation why 
Plaintiff was not promoted. Other plausible explanations may exist. For instance, 
Nasser may not have chosen to promote Plaintiff simply because he personally did 
not like her. 
(Vartivarian v. Golden Rule Insurance 1992) 
But how can the courts distinguish between an admissible business judgment based on 
business necessity or personal preference and inadmissible considerations based on race 
or national origin? Is it simply a matter of presentation of the right arguments by the 
employer? The language we’ve seen so far shows: 
1  
Refusal to acknowledge accent as an immutable characteristic of national origin (mis-
recognition). The court added, “There is no race or physiological reason why Kahakua 
could not have used Standard American English pronunciations” (Matsuda 1991: 
1345). 
2 
Allowing direct and non-factual association of negative social values with stigmatized linguistic 
variants (disinformation): “The agency contended that the appellant’s accent was 
undesirable . . . found to lack authority, friendliness, clarity and other qualities desired 
in a broadcasted voice” (Staruch, EEOC Hearing Opinion). 
[The judge said] “The white candidate was selected because he had ‘better diction, 
better enunciation, better pronunciation, better cadence, better intonation, better 
voice clarity, and better understandability’” (Matsuda 1991:1345, citing from 
Kahakua, Findings of Fact). 
3  
Willingness to allow the media to set its own standards on the basis of personal pref-
erences, even when those preferences necessarily involve language focused discrimination 
(claiming authority): “the judge credited the testimony of speech experts that . . .

----- Page 196 (native) -----
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
171 
Standard American English should be used by radio broadcasters” (Kahakua, 
ibid.). 
“The agency stated that the appellant’s voice was not suitable for broadcast 
purposes . . . Appellant’s voice was described as having a deﬁnite Western Ukrainian 
accent. As in the United States, where national network news is broadcast in ‘television 
accent’ rather than the regional accents sometimes heard on local broadcasts” 
(Staruch, ibid.). 
4  
Lack of concern with established facts about language structure and use, or with consistent, 
non-prejudicial evaluation of language skills (disinformation): “[An external review found 
him] . . . ‘not persuasive’; his pronunciation as ‘often incorrect’, delivery ‘dull’ and 
‘sounding strange to the listener’” (ibid.). 
“I [expert witness, a ‘speech consultant’] urgently recommend he seek professional 
help in striving to lessen this handicap . . . Pidgin can be controlled. And if an individual 
is totally committed to improving, professional help on a long-term basis can produce 
results” (Kahakua 1989: Excerpts of the Record: 31, as cited by Matsuda 1991:1366, 
original emphasis). 
There must be a better way to approach these cases, and in fact, Matsuda proposed a 
process that would be fair to employers and employees both, one by which every position 
can be evaluated in four steps (Matsuda 1991: 1369). My recasting of Matsuda’s four-step 
process takes more linguistic factors into consideration: 
1 
In a typical interaction, the consequences of miscommunication are grave. 
2 
Oral communication is the sole or primary way in which information is exchanged. 
3 
The speech interactions are under high stress where time is of the essence. 
4 
The interactions are typically the ﬁrst and only exchange, so that neither person has 
time to adjust in listening and comprehension patterns. 
5 
There is no face-to-face contact. 
6 
There is “noise in the channels,” such as a bad telephone connection, lots of back-
ground noise, cross-talk. 
Matsuda suggests that there are some jobs that ﬁt all of her points, such as a 911 operator. 
On the other end of the scale would be a computer programmer who worked alone. Most 
jobs would fall some place between the two extremes, and there is still room for loopholes. 
Consider, for example, a retired police ofﬁcer applying for a 911 position in a large city. 
The police ofﬁcer is a native speaker of Spanish, and has a strong Spanish accent in his 
oral communication. Would the hiring committee be acting within reason if they rejected 
him on that basis? Under what circumstances would they be wrong? 
If ideology is most effective when its workings are least visible, then the ﬁrst step must 
be to make visible the link between the enforcement of standard language ideology and 
social domination. Given the way the schools, media and employers work together to 
promote language ideology, the education of the public is both a lonely and a difﬁcult – 
but certainly not an impossible – task. 
Linguists have hard-won knowledge to offer which would be of some assistance in the 
difﬁcult questions faced in matters of language policy, but that knowledge is often not 
sought; if sought, it may be summarily rejected; in either case, it is often hotly resented. 
Nevertheless, there are good reasons to persevere. This type of behavior causes real harm 
to real individuals, and it deserves attention.

172 
THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
In the judicial system there may be some lessons for linguists to learn from psychologists 
and psychiatrists, whose contributions to trial law are better established, although the 
effectiveness and value of those contributions are often challenged, see Vartivarian v. 
Golden Rule Insurance (Faust and Ziskin 1988). 
While the overall quality of contribution of psychologists in legal cases is still being 
debated, some issues have been clariﬁed as a result of that body of testimony. The law now 
deﬁnes and takes seriously such human conditions as battered woman syndrome, clinical 
depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome. Conversely, while the courts have called 
on linguists to address technical matters of authorship and identification to be used as 
evidence, they are less interested in a linguist’s deﬁnition of communicative competence 
or assessment of intelligibility, as was seen in Kahakua and Fragante; these are areas where 
the courts are satisﬁed with their own powers of reasoning and expertise. 
Xieng provides an interesting illustration of the status of linguistics in the courts: there 
was no expert testimony at all on the pivotal matter, which was the employer’s claim that 
Mr. Xieng’s accent was too strong and impeded communication. However, a psychiatrist 
was called, who then argued and convinced the court that there did exist a “causal 
relationship between the [employer’s] national origin discrimination and Xieng’s severe 
emotional distress and depression” (Xieng v. Peoples National Bank of Washington 1991: 
A13). 
Psychologists ask themselves a two-part question to determine the quality of their 
forensic contribution: 
1 
Can we answer questions with reasonable accuracy?  
2 
Can we help the judge and jury reach a more accurate conclusion than would  
otherwise be possible (Faust and Ziskin 1988: 31)? That is, does the subject lie beyond 
the knowledge and experience of the average layman, and can the expert inform 
without invading the province of the jury by expressing a conclusion as to the ultimate 
issue? 
For most of the cases presented here, a list of questions could have been presented to 
linguists which would have met both of these basic criteria. Questions about the process 
of standardization, differences between spoken and written language varieties, cultural 
differences in discourse style and structure which may cause processing difﬁculties, second 
language acquisition and accent, subconscious social evaluation of active variation, and 
change over time and space could be answered with reasonable accuracy. We could provide 
the judge and the jury with information and knowledge beyond that of the average layman, 
but the issue is this: we cannot make them want that information, no matter how factually 
correct or how strongly supported by empirical evidence. 
Linguistic contributions to the legal process are not valued because ideology intervenes 
in a way that it does not in matters of mental health. A judge may have no personal 
investment in accepting evidence linking systematic, long-term physical abuse and violent 
behavior; she is more likely to have a strong personal reaction when asked to reconsider 
the assumptions underlying the standard language ideology. 
Fairclough, who acknowledges this somewhat depressing state of affairs, also points out 
that “resistance and change are not only possible, but are continuously happening. But 
the effectiveness of resistance and the realization of change depend on people developing 
a critical consciousness of domination and its modalities, rather than just experiencing 
them” (1989 [2001]: 4).

Some of the discussion around language standards is so emotional in tone that parallels 
can be drawn to disagreements between scientists and theologians over the centuries. In 
our own time, in the courts, science and rational inquiry have come up against public 
opinion based on personal preferences and intuition: 
[T]he real problem faced is not legal but sociological. In the centers of population 
men have gone on assuming certain bodies of knowledge and certain points of view 
without realizing that they were living in a different world from that inhabited by a 
considerable portion of their fellow-citizens, and they have been unconscious of the 
danger which threatened them at the inevitable moment when the two worlds should 
come in. 
(The Nation, July 22, 1925: 28, cited in Caudill 1989) 
This editorial was written at the height of Scopes trial, in which fundamentalists and 
empiricists argued the very deﬁnition of truth. It was a trial surrounded by sensational 
journalism and followed with great interest by many people. Scopes, a science teacher who 
taught the theory of evolution in a state which forbade him to do so, lost his case and was 
ﬁned one hundred dollars. 
But something else, something perhaps more important, was won. Before the trial, one 
might gather that the majority of American citizens had never come in contact with 
evolutionary theory. After the trial, many of those people were thinking about their own 
beliefs, about science, and about the nature of authority and its relationship to knowledge. 
Whatever an individual’s personal beliefs, after the Scopes trial it became increasingly 
difﬁcult for anyone to dismiss out of hand the facts put forth by scientists. Today, more 
than 70 years later, evolution is taught in all public schools and most private ones. And 
today fundamentalists still ﬁght to have evolutionary science displaced by biblical narratives. 
The Scopes trial involved free speech, educational policy, and a range of sociological 
issues. When the topic is discrimination on the basis of language, the stakes are very 
different. Mandhare, Hou, Xieng, Kahakua and the other cases like them test an even 
more basic freedom: the individual’s right to be different: 
The way we talk, whether it is a life choice or an immutable characteristic, is akin to 
other attributes of the self that the law protects. In privacy law, due process law, 
protection against cruel and unusual punishment, and freedom from inquisition, we 
say the state cannot intrude upon the core of you, cannot take away your sacred places 
of the self. A citizen’s accent, I would argue, resides in one of those places. 
(Matsuda 1991: 1391–1392) 
It would seem that linguistics and language-focused discrimination have yet to meet their 
Scopes trial. 
Appendix: the U.S. civil court structure 
Before we leave the thorny discussion of linguistics and language-focused discrimination, 
let us look closely at the civil court structure in the U.S (Table 9.2). The ﬁrst level is the 
trial courts. 
If any party is dissatisfied with the outcome of a trial, they may appeal to the inter-
mediate courts of appeal (Table 9.3).

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
In Kyomugisha v. Clowney and the University of Wisconsin, Clowney asked the following 
question during her deposition: “How about the burden on the other person to go and 
take courses and study and to be understood as well why should the burden be on the 
recipient?” How would you characterize Clowney’s position? How do you think someone 
in her position might fail to see the ﬂaws in her arguments? 
Matsuda talks about positive reactions to accents, which may “charm, surprise, intrigue.” 
Which accents do you perceive positively? Pick one, and think about what underlies your 
positive evaluation. Is there any more substance to this positive evaluation than there is 
to a negative evaluation? 
One of Matsuda’s students once wrote: “What would be the point of being a citizen if 
non-citizens had equal rights?” How would you answer that question? 
The courts have sometimes disagreed with the claim that accent is immutable. There is 
generally agreement that skin color is immutable, but language features are not. How do 
technological advances change our understanding of “immutability?” As it becomes 
possible to change skin color and gender, does that mean race and sex should no longer 
be protected? 
Where does religion – another protected category – ﬁt into the question of immutability? 
See if you can come up with an interpretation that justiﬁes the use of “immutability” in 
some cases and not others, and decide where language features ﬁt into the bigger picture. 
Of the cases presented in this chapter, which is most reminiscent of the language 
subordination model? Which is least? 
Notes 
1 As will become clear, there are exceptions. For example, if the employer could show 
that the environment poses a physical danger to someone wearing a headscarf, the 
court would likely agree with the employer. In addition, companies employing less 
than 15 workers are not bound by these statutes. 
2 Discrimination is a matter of law: “the effect of a statute or established practice which 
confers particular privileges on a class arbitrarily selected from a large number of 
persons, all of whom stand in the same relation to the privileges granted and between 
whom and those not favored no reasonable distinction can be found” (Black’s Law 
Dictionary 1991: 323).

3 Some courts have ruled that the customer-preference argument does not apply to 
language-focused Title VII discrimination. This is a matter of some debate, and Smith 
argues persuasively that customer preference should be excluded in these cases as they 
are in other protected categories. 
4 See also Cutler (1985). 
5 You will ﬁnd ﬂow charts for the court system and the progression of civil actions in 
the Appendix at the end of this chapter. 
6 The EEOC reviews complaints and if they ﬁnd a violation has taken place, they may 
take on the case and file suit for the employee against the employer. Raj Gupta, 
formerly of the EEOC, estimates that the EEOC prosecutes 70 percent of such cases; 
in the other 30 percent, they may or may not grant a Notice of Right to Sue. Lack of 
such Notice does not prohibit the employee from proceeding; the right to pursue such 
matters in the courts is sacrosanct. Thus the Notice of Right to Sue is primarily an 
indication to the employee of the strength of the case. For employees of federal 
government agencies, the EEOC conducts the hearing, which is empowered by Title 
VII to hear discrimination cases; if they ﬁnd for the plaintiff, they can order remedies. 
The federal agencies can appeal only to the EEOC. 
7 Further excluded or missing are: cases which primarily concerned the English-Only 
question and cases in which language-focused discrimination played a minimal role in 
the Plaintiff’s arguments. 
8 There are no summary statistics kept by the EEOC and no central logging system for 
such cases, and even if proceedings were begun, many cases are not summarized for 
publication. All statistics are based on the court cases that took place prior to May, 
1993. 
9 This study was conducted in response to a series of inquiries from Congress on the 
effect of the 1986 immigration laws. Not all the GAO’s findings were clear or 
interpretable, especially in the matter of speciﬁcally accent-based discrimination. The 
report in question outlines a number of reasons for this having to do with sampling 
and design questions. 
10 A table of all cases mentioned is provided in Table 9.4. All quotes are taken from court 
documents and summaries of court findings, opinions, and complaints. Table 9.5 
provides a list of all the cases studied for this chapter but not cited expressly but 
included in the statistics quoted. 
11  Haole is a reference to both skin color (white) and geographic origins (someplace other 
than Hawai’i). It is often used and understood in a negative way. 
12 According to Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs: 
In many circumstances, as in literary forms, lectures, and radio broadcasts, writers 
and speakers are distant from their addressees in place, time, or both. They might 
be assumed to adhere to a weakened version of mutual responsibility . . . speakers 
still monitor what they say . . . It is just that they do all this without feedback from 
listeners. 
(1990: 35–36) 
The radio broadcasters, of course, are reading from prepared texts and so the 
distribution of communicative burden does not apply in the way it does in discourse. 
13 Most of the details of this case originate in Matsuda’s seminal 1991 article on language-
focused discrimination in the courts (Matsuda 1991: 1902). 
14 It seems that three distinct kinds of expert witnesses testify in these trials: linguists 
(for example, Charlene Sato of the University of Hawaii testified in the Kahakua 
case); speech pathologists; and “speech consultants.” The last group is often composed

THE WORKPLACE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
of those who teach “accent reduction” classes, or otherwise have a vested interest 
in the official commendation of a *SAE. Some judges, especially the judge who 
heard the Kahakua case, are very receptive to arguments made by accent reduction 
witnesses. 
15 Fragante is Filipino, a fact that might seem trivial most people outside Hawai’i, but it 
is not. Japanese-Filipino relations are considered in more depth in Chapter 12. 
16 I was contacted by the Plaintiff’s attorney and asked to consult on this case, should it 
come to trial. The case was settled after early depositions, and thus my services were 
not required, and I took no compensation for initial consultations. 
17 English is the ofﬁcial language of instruction from ﬁrst grade onwards in Uganda; the 
University of Makerere’s language of instruction is also English. English is the 
language of government and commerce and the primary medium of education; ofﬁcial 
publications and most major newspapers appear in English, and English is often 
employed in radio and television broadcasts. There are other languages which serve 
as lingua francas, including Swahili and French. Which is dominant at any one time is 
dependent on a wide range of political and social variables. 
18 As the Chancellor of the University acknowledged in 1996, while Ms. Kyomugisha 
does not speak “Wisconsin English, she nevertheless speaks perfectly ﬁne English” 
(Kyomugisha v. Clowney, complaint ﬁled October 16, 1997). 
19 There were no charges of racism ﬁled against Clowney, perhaps because she was also 
African American. Racism and animosity between African Americans and African 
nationals is a larger topic, one that is relevant to this and other cases. 
20 I conducted two phone interviews with Ms. Mandhare in 1994. Those interviews are 
the source of much of the detail provided here. 
21 Ms. Mandhare tells a very different story. In interview, she alleged that her ﬁrst year 
at the K-2 school was also the principal’s ﬁrst year, and that he openly admitted that 
he had promised her job as librarian to someone else. She reports that he asked her to 
request a transfer, which she did not wish to do. After this episode, he told her in a 
one-to-one meeting that she had a “very heavy accent.” 
22 For a more recent but very similar case, see Poskocil v. Roanoke County. Poskocil, a 
native of Columbia who speaks Spanish as her ﬁrst language, had repeatedly applied 
for a teaching position and was repeatedly rejected on the basis of her accent, to which 
the students objected. Poskocil was applying to teach Spanish. 
23 In another study, Kavas and Kavas (2008) found much less animosity toward teachers 
with accents at Southeastern University. However, their data originated in a self-
administered solicitation of student opinions. This provides us with an idea of what 
students believe they believe, or what they know they are supposed to believe, but it 
reveals nothing about the actual nature of the relationship between foreign-accented 
faculty and the student. 
24 Hill (2008) examines the predisposition to make excuses for and rationalize evidence 
of racism when the person in question is a white male in a position of power.

The real trouble with Black language1 10 
It is not the Black child’s language which is despised: It is his experience. 
James Baldwin, “Nobody knows my name” (1985b) 
A white face goes with a white mind. Occasionally a Black face goes with a white mind. 
Very seldom a white face will have a Black mind.

Grammar: resistance is futile 
AAVE has been the focus of formal study for some 40 years, so that there is no lack of 
material available for anyone who is interested in learning about it. While there is not 
space to look into that wealth of information in this chapter, a short summary of crucial 
features of Black language (referred to here primarily as African American Vernacular 
English, AAVE) will be helpful when considering the speech communities that use these 
languages in a larger context.2 
The features of AAVE that distinguish it from other varieties of American English have 
to do with phonology and the grammatical or syntactic structures, as seen in Table 10.1. 
However, there are other aspects which are more markedly different. Most important are 
AAVE’s prosodic and rhetorical features (Alim 2004b; Alim and Baugh 2007; Baugh 1983; 
Green 2002a; Rickford and Rickford 2000; Smitherman 2000, 2003a, 2003b, 2006), in 
particular, concepts (such as style) which do not lend themselves to the quantitative analysis 
of traditional sociolinguistics. 
In Spoken Soul, Rickford and Rickford point to more than three decades of research as 
solid evidence “that listeners are able to identify accurately the ethnicity of Black and white 
speakers on the basis of tape-recorded samples of their speech, some less than 2.5 seconds 
long” (2000: 101–102, 241n).3 Green (2002) provides a detailed look at AAVE pitch range, 
tone, intonation and syllable structure, all contributing to the understanding of AAVE as 
a language with a unique rhythm.4 Work in linguistic proﬁling adds weight to the common 
belief that it is usually possible to identify a person’s race (and sometimes, ethnicity) on 
the basis of the spoken word without visual cues (Anderson 2007; Baugh 2003; Chin 2010; 
Smalls 2004). 
Middle-class African Americans may seldom or never use grammatical features of AAVE, 
but such persons can still signal solidarity with the greater African American community 
by careful engagement of discourse strategies, intonation contour, and pitch. These 
strategies are what Smitherman calls the African American Verbal Tradition, which further 
encompasses speech acts speciﬁc to the community such as signiﬁcation, call-and-response, 
tonal semantics and sermonic tone (Smitherman 1995b).5 Smitherman elaborates on this 
in other publications.

THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
The African American verbal tradition clashes with the European American tradition 
because there are different – and, yes, contradictory – cultural assumptions about 
what constitutes appropriate discourse, rhetorical strategies, and styles of speaking. 
While the African American linguistic style has been described as passionate, 
emotional, and “hot” and the European as objective, detached, and “cold,” we are 
seriously oversimplifying if we assert that one tradition is superior. What is not an 
oversimpliﬁcation, however, is that African and European Americans have different 
attitudes about and responses to a speaker depending on whether she uses one style or 
the other. 
(Smitherman 2000: 254) 
Since the ﬁrst edition of this book, serious study of Hip Hop culture has produced a body 
of interdisciplinary work relevant to this discussion. In terms of language, discourse and 
communication, much of this work has occurred at the cross-section of linguistics and 
cultural anthropology (Bucholtz 2003). While the term was ﬁrst used to reference a musical 
movement, Hip Hop Studies have expanded beyond the local to the global. In the States, 
Hip Hop is a reference to an urban, youth-focused culture which has evolved from its 
origins in African American and Latino communities on both coasts in the 1970s, and 
which values creativity, color and style. 
This is a very large topic and one that cannot be seriously addressed in this chapter, but 
the relevance of the complex relationship between the languages of African American 
communities and evolving Hip Hop Nation can hardly be overestimated. What is 
especially interesting is the way this approach has made it possible to bring almost 
intangible issues into clearer focus. In his 2004b study and elsewhere, Alim addresses the 
importance of creativity of “Style. Steelo. Steez. The fact that there are at least three 
different lexical items to describe the concept of style in Hip Hop Nation Language . . . 
underscores its importance to the community” (2004b: 2–3). There are suggestions for 
further readings in this area at the end of the chapter. 
Style, authenticity, and race 
Smitherman looked closely at the distinctive style and rhetorical features of AAVE in her 
analysis of the African American community’s differing responses to the Anita Hill and 
Clarence Thomas controversy. 
In 1991, George Bush nominated Clarence Thomas, an African American jurist, to the 
Supreme Court. In the course of conﬁrmation hearings in the Senate a witness rose to 
lodge a protest. Anita Hill, an African American law professor who had worked under 
Thomas at the EEOC, came forward to charge Thomas with sexual harassment in the 
workplace. She provided ample detail and answered the Senate’s questions with dignity 
and calm. A media frenzy arose around Hill’s testimony and Thomas’s responses; the 
matter was debated ﬁercely across the country. 
Thomas was confirmed by a 52–48 vote. Many who supported Hill suggested that 
in a Senate that was 98 percent male, Hill’s charges were never taken seriously 
(Smitherman 1995a). In her study of reactions to the case, Smitherman found cultural 
differences in discourse style: Hill’s rhetorical devices were distinctly Anglo, while 
Thomas

capitalized on and ruthlessly exploited the African American Verbal Tradition for all 
it was worth. He seized the rhetorical advantage, swaying Black opinion by use of the 
touchstones of the Oral Tradition and sociolinguistically constructing an image of 
himself as culturally Black and at one with the Folk. 
(ibid.: 238–239) 
Approaching this same issue from another angle, Weldon’s (2008) study of middle-class 
African Americans again underscores the importance of African American verbal traditions 
in establishing a linguistic connection to the great African American community. In 
analyzing a video recording of African Americans talking together during a televised sym-
posium she found that some participants moved back and forth between AAVE and *SAE 
by means of phonology and grammar, but the most usual strategy was to employ AAVE 
rhetorical devices. 
Spears, a native speaker of AAVE, provides a more personal view of the rhetorical 
contrasts between his native variety of English and *SAE. It is a very useful illustration, 
and so I quote it in full: 
The radical difference between the discursive toolkit of African Americans and other 
Americans, whites in particular, is revealed by an observation I have made numerous 
times. Often at social gatherings of blacks and whites (or other nonblacks), everyone 
begins the evening talking together. The talk is effortless, natural, and unmonitored. 
There arrives, however, a point late in the evening when many of the black guests in 
integrated conversation groups begin shifting into black ways of speaking. As this 
continues, the whites (and other nonblacks) increasingly fall silent, no longer able to 
fully understand or participate in the conversation that the blacks are carrying on. 
Their confusion must result from listening to remarks made in English, the common 
language, whose meaning, intent, and relevance cannot be interpreted, for the simple 
reason that those remarks require a different communicative competence. These 
occurrences are instructive for highlighting the difference between linguistic (gram-
matical) competence and communicative (discourse) competence. They also reinforce 
the idea that the principal differences between African American speech and that of 
other American English speakers lie in communicative practices. This is one of several 
reasons why African American communicative practices require more attention. 
(Spears 2007: 100) 
This analysis of culturally speciﬁc rhetorical styles makes one thing very clear: even when 
no grammatical, phonological or lexical features of AAVE are used, a person can, in effect, 
still be speaking AAVE. Thus, while the core grammatical features of AAVE may be heard 
most consistently in poorer Black communities where there are strong social and 
communication networks, AAVE prosody, intonation and rhetorical style are heard, on 
occasion, from prominent and successful African Americans in public forums. These may 
be individuals who grew up in AAVE-speaking communities but who are bidialectal, or 
others who grew up with a different variety of English altogether, and still chose to try to 
acquire AAVE (with differing degrees of success, as seen in Baugh’s (1992) examination 
of the mistakes made by adults who are acquiring AAVE as a second language. 
So some subset of AAVE speakers have learned how to shift toward *SAE in terms of 
grammar in order to evade the overt discrimination that comes along with their mother

THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
tongue. Most of these people will still signal their allegiance to the community by means 
of intonation and other prosodic features. This is almost certainly not a conscious decision, 
but an element of language performance – an attempt to satisfy the expectations of the 
listeners – that is a common feature of human communication. 
Defying the definition 
The 1990 census reported that the U.S. African American population grew about 10 
percent between 1980 and 1990, for a count of 29,427,000, or about 12 percent of the 
country’s total population. In 2007, the estimated population ﬁgures saw some change 
(Figure 10.1). How many Americans of African descent speak African American Vernacular 
English is a relevant but difﬁcult question, in part because there is no deﬁnition of AAE 
or AAVE that has wide consensus.6 
Various authors have put the number of AAVE speakers between 80 and 90 percent of 
the African American population (Baugh 1983; Rickford 2000). What can be said with 
more certainty is that AAVE speakers come from all socioeconomic backgrounds and 
circumstances. Further, while not all persons of African ancestry speak AAVE, the 
language is spoken by people who are not African American. Children and adolescents 
learn the language they hear around them, regardless of race or ethnicity. A blond, blue-
eyed child raised with African American playmates in an African American community 
where AAVE predominates will in fact, learn AAVE – though she may also learn other 
varieties of English at the same time. 
Stereotypes about AAVE speakers (for example, that it is primarily the language of the 
poor who live in large cities) originate primarily through the information and entertain-

ment industries which have “conveyed the impression that Black speech was the lingo of 
criminals, dope pushers, teenage hoodlums, and various and sundry hustlers, who spoke 
in ‘muthafuckas’ and ‘pussy-copping raps’” (Smitherman 1988: 84). 
There are dozens of websites that exist only to mock African American English (often 
referred to as Ebonics).7 On some of these sites, classic literature has been translated into 
what is supposed to be Ebonics; on others you will ﬁnd quizzes to test how Black you are 
or how well you “speak Ebonics,” as seen in Figure 10.2. 
Many of these sites have been closely studied – not to document errors (of which there 
are many) – but to look at the way an anti-Ebonics ideology is constructed (Hill 1995, 
1998; Rickford and Rickford 2000; Ronkin and Karn 1999). For example, the so-called 
translation of the nursery rhyme “Jack and Jill went up the hill” into Ebonics includes the 
line “Jack be felt down,” which Ronkin and Karn (1999: 366) cite as a case of the misuse 
of the passive voice, as well as the hyper-use of habitual “be.” That is, non-AAVE speakers 
who set out to mock the language show a fondness for adding superﬂuous instances of 
“be” in places it does not belong. “Jack be felt down,” is as ill formed in AAVE as the 
sentence “Jack down were fallen” is ill formed in any variety of American English. Ronkin 
and Karn provide many similar examples of AAVE that has been mangled (out of ignorance 
or an attempt at humor) with the apparent purpose of highlighting how very different 
AAVE is from “good” or “proper” English. 
It has been established that AAVE has a rule-governed grammar. As this is the case for 
all living languages, it could be said that grammar is inevitable, and resistance is futile. To 
ignore this fact about AAVE is to demonstrate ignorance, condescension and disrespect.

THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
Linguists do bear some responsibility for language-focused stereotypes, for the simple 
reason that for some 40 years, most of the scholarly work on AAVE has focused on the 
inner-city poor. There were many reasons for this, some of them practical, as in Rickford’s 
observation that the most segregated and poorest African Americans are the most 
persistent speakers of AAVE and thus provide a great deal of useful data (Rickford 2010: 
28). There are also ideological and practical motivations evident in the earliest work on 
the African American language community: 
[S]ociolinguists’ validation of [AAVE] as a legitimate linguistic variety [was] a revolu-
tionary viewpoint that challenged generations of racism, linguistic and otherwise 
. . . Thus the most useful conceptualization of the AAVE speech community at the 
time, both politically and theoretically, was one in which those speakers whose 
speech was mislabeled as substandard or even as not really language at all were placed 
at the very center, as the most competent and systematic speakers of a complete and 
systematic variety. 
(Bucholtz 2003: 402) 
To make up for what is, in retrospect, a lop-sided picture of AAVE, linguists have been 
looking more closely at the wider African American community, most speciﬁcally at the 
middle classes (Anderson and Middleton 2005; Kautzsch 2002; Kendall and Wolfram 
2009; Wassink 2004; Weldon 2008). Kendall and Wolfram (2009) lay out a comprehensive 
blueprint for a more inclusive sampling across the full range of speech acts that compose 
what might be called the African American linguistic marketplace (Wolfram, forthcoming). 
This reasonable and perhaps too-long-put-off shift of focus takes into account the growth 
of an African American middle class and in parallel, the evolution of what has been called 
African American Standard English (AASE) (Spears 2009: 3), African American English 
(AAE) or Black Standard English (BSE) (Taylor 1983). Given the tendency to focus too 
closely on one aspect of the larger picture, Wolfram cautions against absolute dichotomies: 
Weldon’s study exposes spurious dichotomies such as the nominal distinction between 
standard and vernacular African American English; it also raises questions about the 
role of personal presentation and audience in public speeches, including the extent 
of stylistic shift, performative code-switching, and the persistence of vernacular 
variants in the speech of some prominent African Americans in more formal public 
settings with mainstream, public audiences. 
(Wolfram 2011) 
There is a great deal of regional and social variation in AAVE. The language of African 
Americans living in the rural South is different from that of the Latino- and Anglo 
Americans who live alongside them, but it is also different from the AAVE spoken in urban 
centers in the South (Cukor-Avila 2001, 2003; Green 2002; Rickford 2010; Wolfram 
2007). With increasing wealth and the growth of the Black middle class, the community 
becomes more socially complex, and AAVE keeps pace. 
Of these grammatical features (which are not exclusive to the African American language 
community, please keep this in mind), only the use of what as a relative pronoun seems 
to be disappearing from both urban and rural AAVE. Other features (negative inversion, 
regularized past form) seem solid regardless of the setting. More relevant still, Wolfram 
(2004c) identiﬁes a number of features which are new or intensifying in urban AAVE.

There is a growing body of research which focuses on what Morgan and DeBerry (1995) 
claim is another dimension of variation within and between AAVE communities by looking 
at the way that African American youth active in Urban Hip Hop culture must choose 
among grammatical, lexical and phonological variables which identify them as aligned with 
either the West or East coast. In a similar way, Wolfram and his students (2007: 8) have 
looked at features such as /r/ deletion in postvocalic word ﬁnal position (mother, manager) 
to establish that supra-regional features of AAVE are subject to regional inﬂuences. 
Baugh draws attention to wider implications of terminology and labels: 
Ebonics suffers from several deﬁnitional detriments that can no longer be dismissed 
. . . I therefore hope that these remarks expose some of the scholarly and educational 
perils of attempting to adopt Ebonics as either a technical linguistic term or as an 
educational philosophy, at least as long as multiple and contradictory definitions 
[exist]. Just as a house that is divided cannot stand, linguistic terminology that alleges 
to have scientiﬁc validity cannot survive with multiple deﬁnitions. 
(Baugh 2000: 86) 
Anglo attitudes toward AAVE8 
African Americans who speak American English without any grammatical or stylistic 
features of AAVE – for example, those who grow up with no contact of any kind to an 
African American family or community – certainly do exist, although their number would 
be very hard to estimate. 
It’s important to remember that for most Anglos, the primary and sometimes sole 
experience of African Americans comes through mass media, where Black men and women 
in power suits sound Anglo or very close to it, for as Smitherman (1997) explains: “Blacks 
have believed that the price of the ticket for Black education and survival and success in 
White America is eradication of Black Talk.” In the information industry, those who do

THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
speak AAVE are seen primarily when someone – usually somebody poor, possibly victim-
ized and/or suspected of a criminal offence – is interviewed. It is hardly a surprise that 
most Anglos have a skewed impression of AAVE and AAVE speakers (see also the earlier 
Smitherman quote on stereotypes in the media).9 
These practices do not go unnoticed by African American media professionals: 
A few years ago most of the blacks at CNN lodged a protest about the material we 
were using on the air. They complained that every time we did a story on poverty, 
we rolled out “b-roll” showing blacks, and every time we did a story on crime, we 
rolled out “b-roll” with blacks in it. We went back and looked at our ﬁle tape and, in 
fact, it was all black. 
(Westin 2000: 24, as cited in Abraham and Appiah 2006) 
We take in ideas and pictures – Black men being arrested, a stockpile of guns – like a daily 
dose of medicine lest we forget the way the world works: More evidence of a gulf between 
them and us, African ancestry and Anglo, criminal and victim. 
In a parallel way, Anglos rarely hesitate when they are asked their opinions on AAVE. 
Without pause, individuals will tell you what is wrong with the language and the people 
who speak it. Complaints tend to fall into two categories: (1) targeted lexical items or 
grammatical features which cause immediate reaction; and (2) general issues of language 
purity and authority. The purpose is the same, however, no matter the packaging: this 
kind of criticism is the tool of choice when it comes to silencing the peripheralized. 
In their criticisms of AAVE, Anglos tend to focus on morphological markers (for 
example, third person singular verb endings as in she sit, he go, she say, he yell) and the 
pronunciation of speciﬁc words. One of the most salient points of phonological variation 
which is strongly stigmatized from outside the Black community might be called the great 
ask–aks controversy. 
The verb “to ask” is commonly deﬁned as meaning to call for information, to request 
a desired thing, or to inquire. There are two pronunciations heard commonly in the U.S.: 
[æsk] and [æks]. In rapid speech, a third pronunciation [æst] is often heard, derived from 
[æsk]. The Oxford English Dictionary establishes this variation between [æsk] and [æks] as 
very old, a result of the Old English metathesis10 asc-, acs-. From this, followed Middle 
English variation with many possible forms: ox, ax, ex, ask, esk, ash, esh, ass, ess. Finally, 
ax or aks survived to almost 1600 as the regular literary form, when ask became the literary 
preference. 
Most people know nothing of the history of this form, and believe the aks variant to be 
an innovation of AAVE speakers. In fact, it is found in Appalachian speech, in some urban 
dialects in the New York metropolitan area, and outside the U.S. in some regional varieties 
of British English.11 I have heard it from friends and Italian-American relatives in the 
Hudson Valley. However, if I had pointed the usage out, there would have been broad 
and angry denial. 
Anglo-English speakers are eager and willing to point out this usage in others which is 
characterized as the most horrendous of errors: 
On the last day that I met with my adopt-a-class last year, I told the students that they 
will have to learn to read, write, do math, and speak English properly if they are going 
to get a ﬁrst-rate job and be a success. I told them there was one word that will mark 
them as uneducated . . . A young girl raised her hand and said, “The word is ax.” . . .

----- Page 216 (native) -----
THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
191 
I asked her if she could pronounce the word properly. She said, “Yes, it is ask.” . . . I 
felt terriﬁc. By simply raising that one word on an earlier occasion, I had focused their 
attention on something that I think is important, and I am sure you do as well . . . 
You were present at Martin Luther King, Jr. High School last week when the opening 
ceremony was conducted regarding the High School Institute for Law and Justice. A 
young girl in the class was asked to read her essay. The content of her essay was 
excellent, but at one point she pronounced the word “ask” as “ax.” I believe that every-
one in the room recognizing the mis-pronunciation was distressed and, regrettably, 
the substance of her essay was [thus made] less important. 
(Edward I. Koch, Mayor of New York city, to the 
Chancellor of Education, cited in Koch 1989: 21–22) 
I guess what I’d like to say is that what makes me feel that Blacks tend to be ignorant 
is that they fail to see that the word is spelled A-S-K, not A-X. And when they say 
aksed, it gives the sentence an entirely different meaning. And that is what I feel holds 
Blacks back. 
(Female call-in viewer, Oprah Winfrey Show, 1989) 
My husband came here from Germany and he learned how to say a-s-k, so why 
can’t you? 
(Overheard) 
All of these criticisms of the stigmatized aks variant assume that its use is the result of 
ignorance or stupidity following from lack of education or laziness. Why else, this rea-
soning goes, would someone hold on willfully to such an ugly, contemptuous usage? Most 
disturbing is the cheerful, almost gleeful acceptance of a single variable as a suitable basis 
for judging the speaker’s character and intelligence, and from there, to reject the content 
completely. Former New York Mayor Koch dismisses a presentation which he otherwise 
ﬁnds well done and convincing on the basis of a single sociolinguistic variant; Harper’s 
prints his letter to the Chancellor of Education without comment. 
The authority cited here is the written language: aks is wrong because we write ask. 
This kind of criticism is particularly illogical, given the large-scale lack of correspondence 
between sound and symbol in English. The call-in viewer, citing the authority of the 
written language, provided excellent proof of this. She spoke what is commonly considered 
*SAE (albeit with a strong Chicago accent), and like others who speak unstigmatized 
varieties of American English, she did not aspirate the /h/ in “what”; she pronounced 
spelled /spelt/, and she left out the /n/ and /t/ in “sentence,” and substituted a glottal stop. 
Uninformed or less than factual criticisms are troublesome, but they are overshadowed 
by other more explicit and unapologetic condemnations of AAVE which extend to 
unfounded criticisms of African American culture and values. Such criticisms are often 
openly made, in particular by newspaper columnists, as in a sports column: 
Ungrammatical street talk by Black professional athletes, and other Blacks in public 
professions such as the music industry, has come to be accepted. Indeed, “Moses, you 
is a baaad damn shootin’ individual” comes a lot closer to proper English usage than 
many public sentences uttered by Black athletes . . . But there’s a problem here. Black 
athletes – and Black musicians and TV performers, etc. – are role models for young 
Black children. We in the media have begun to pass on the street language of Black

----- Page 217 (native) -----
192 
THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
“superstars” verbatim . . . and what this is doing is passing the message to a whole 
new generation of Black children that it’s OK to talk that way; more than OK, it’s 
terriﬁc to talk that way . . . the situation is compounded by leading Black characters 
in several network television shows, who use street grammar to advance the feeling 
that they are young and cool. 
The dilemma is that it doesn’t make much difference for the Black professional 
athletes, etc., who talk this way – they’re wealthy men who are going to live well off 
their bodily skills no matter if they can talk at all, much less correctly . . . if a Black 
child emulates one of the dumb-talking Black athletes he sees being interviewed on 
TV, he is not going to be thought of as a superstar. He is going to be thought of as 
a stupid kid, and later, as a stupid adult . . . They probably aren’t talking that way 
because they think it’s right; they’re talking that way because it’s a signal that they 
reject the white, middle-class world that they have started to live in the midst of. 
(Bob Greene’s Sports Column, Chicago Tribune, December 3, 1979)12 
While censure of AAVE is not hard to ﬁnd, it is not often that such criticisms and the 
underlying assumptions are so openly and unapologetically voiced. 
Greene identiﬁes two professions which he associates with successful African Americans: 
sports and entertainment. What these people have in common, in his estimation, is the 
fact that they speak AAVE, that they are in the public eye, and that they have the power 
to lead the Black youth of America astray. His point, and it is factually true, is that with 
the exception of these two groups, very few African Americans who achieve mainstream 
economic and social success are able to do it without the necessity of linguistic and to some 
degree, cultural assimilation. 
What seems to bother Greene so much is the fact that the gatekeeping mechanism is 
not perfect: it does not extend to all African Americans. Some have successfully evaded 
the language of what he freely identiﬁes as that of the Anglo middle class. It is irritating 
to him that these people have managed to become successful without good language, but 
there is something even more upsetting. As a sports journalist, he ﬁnds himself compelled 
to pass on the language he hears from athletes, thus becoming complicit in letting the 
secret out to Black children: not all African Americans give in linguistically, and yet they 
still get to the top. 
Greene makes a series of factually incorrect assumptions. Black children learn AAVE 
not from television actors and sports ﬁgures (as Greene surmises), but in their homes, as 
their ﬁrst and native variety of U.S. English. More importantly, Greene assumes that the 
only role models that African American children have are these sports and entertainment 
individuals, and further, that a good role model will not sound Black. For him, the two 
are mutually exclusive. His message is clearly stated: 
If you’re a Black child, and you’re not one of the 100 or so best slam-dunkers or wide 
receivers in the world, you can go ahead and emulate the way you hear your heroes 
talk. But the chances are that you’ll wind up as the hippest dude passing out towels 
in the men’s washroom. 
(ibid.) 
The stereotypes that underlie Greene’s assumptions are of course very disturbing, but 
there are other issues here which are more subtle and perhaps more damaging.

This is a good example of both explicit threat and unfounded promise in one statement. 
The threat is real enough: Black children who don’t learn white English will have limited 
choices; what he claims is demonstrably true. But the inverse of this situation, the implied 
promise, is not equally true: Black children who learn *SAE will not be given automatic 
access to the rewards and possibilities of the Anglo middle-class world. Greene actually 
touches upon the fallacy underlying this promise when he acknowledges (later in his 
column) that successful Blacks who wear uniforms (airline pilots, army ofﬁcers) are often 
taken for service personnel in public places. 
Anglo discomfort with AAVE is often externalized in this paternalistic voice. It can be 
seen to work in a variety of forums, including popular ﬁction.13 The novel is one of the 
most interesting points of access to current language ideology, in that the way that 
characters in novels use language and talk about language can be revealing. The following 
excerpt from a romance novel entitled Family Blessings provides a typical social construction 
of an idealized relationship between an *SAE speaker and an AAVE speaker. Here the 
hero, a young Anglo police ofﬁcer, has taken on the job of setting an African American 
child straight: 
“Yo.” 
“What you talkin’ like a Black boy for?” 
“I be Black.” 
“You might be, but no sense talking like a dumb one if you ever want to get anywhere 
in this world . . .”  
. . . 
“I could turn you in for dat, you know. Teachers in school can’t even make us change 
how we talk. It’s the rules. We got our culture to preserve.” 
“I’m not your teacher, and if you ask me, you’re preserving the wrong side of your 
culture . . . listen to you, talking like a dummy! I told you, if you want to get out 
someday and make something of yourself and have a truck like this and a job where 
you can wear decent clothes and people will respect you, you start by talking like a 
smart person, which you are. I could hack that oreo talk if it was real, but the ﬁrst 
time I picked you up for doing the ﬁve-ﬁnger discount over at the SA station, you 
talked like every other kid in your neighborhood . . .” 
“I’m twelve years old. You not supposed to talk to me like dat.” 
“Tell you what – I’ll make you a deal. I’ll talk to you nicer if you’ll talk to me nicer. 
And the ﬁrst thing you do is stop using that F word. And the second thing you do is 
start pronouncing words the way your ﬁrst-grade teacher taught you to. The word is 
that, not dat.” 
(Spencer 1993) 
Like Greene’s sports column, the hero in this novel has both threats and promises for the 
African American child. The kind of authority cited is different: Greene draws on his own 
mastery of middle-class written English, as exempliﬁed in his profession as a writer; in

THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
contrast, this fictional character has nothing more to underscore his pronouncements 
about language than his own observations and the trappings of his own success. This is 
what you can have, he says, if you start sounding like me. If you do not, you do so out of 
stubbornness and stupidity, and there is no hope for you. This character is otherwise 
portrayed as an honest, trustworthy, caring and intelligent individual, to which the author 
adds this dose of linguicism without apparent second thought. 
Occasionally there is a public outpouring of pure emotion, without any of the common 
sense arguments, complex rationalizations, or threats and promises which are such an 
integral part of more organized institutionalized subordination tactics. Such outpourings 
are useful, because they get right to the heart of the matter: 
I am sitting here just burning . . . the ones that want to speak or care to speak that 
way, they want to be different. I believe they put themselves that way to be separate. 
(European American call-in viewer, Oprah Winfrey Show, 1987, emphasis added) 
AAVE seems to symbolize African American resistance to a cultural mainstreaming pro-
cess which is seen as the logical and reasonable cost of equality – and following from that, 
success – in other realms. Alternately, AAVE evokes a kind of panic, a realization that 
desegregation has not done its job. The reasoning seems to be that the logical conclusion 
to a successful civil rights movement is the end of racism not because we have come to 
accept difference, but because we have eliminated difference. There will be no need for a 
distinct African American (or Honduran, or Vietnamese) culture (or language), because 
those people will have full access to, and control of, the superior European American one. 
When an African American woman tells a reporter about the unifying function of AAVE 
in her community, his response ﬁrst acknowledges that language as viable, but then he 
rejects her construction of the language as one with a positive function. Instead, he recasts 
AAVE as a willful act of political resistance: 
Woman: So we gotta have our survival mechanism within our community. And our 
language is it. It lets us know that we all in this thing together. 
Reporter: Black English is not Standard English spoken badly – Black English is revenge. 
(CBS Evening News, December 5, 1985) 
The Oxford English Dictionary defines “revenge” as “The act of doing hurt or harm to 
another in return for wrong or injury suffered; satisfaction obtained by repayment of 
injuries.” Thus AAVE is not seen as ﬁrst and foremost a positive feature of a vibrant Black 
community. Instead it is willful act of rebellion: destructive, hurtful, and primitive in its 
motivations. The reporter attempts to construct an objective picture and definition of 
AAVE, but then falls back on more traditional views of the excluded and resentful outsider. 
This kind of reasoning is seen even from linguists on occasion. The ongoing 
convergence–divergence controversy (is AAVE becoming more or less distinct? closer or 
farther away from *SAE?) might be understood as the unease some have with the idea that 
the African American community has a healthy, thriving, naturally evolving culture of its 
own which resists assimilation despite the near inevitability that disadvantage will follow. 
Such discussions and tendencies seem to come to the surface most often when the 
subject at hand is African American school performance and reading scores. The 
underlying ideological conﬂict can be seen very clearly in scholarly work on AAVE in the 
classroom and school system.14

195 
William Labov’s extensive work on how to improve the lot of African American students 
demonstrates the disconnect between what he knows to be true (AAVE is a fully functional 
language) and the common-sense arguments put forth by those who practice linguistic 
separatism. Two examples from his published work illustrate this tendency. 
Labov and Harris’s study of language use in Philadelphia produced a lot of important 
data on the basis of vocalic and verbal system changes and went on to conclude that the 
city is “separating into two distinct speech communities: white and Black” (Labov and 
Harris 1986: 20). The data was laboriously gathered and carefully analyzed, but the 
conclusions drawn are less than neutral. Labov’s stance on the convergence–divergence 
controversy leans clearly toward assimilation. Consider the suggestions here: 
[I]t should be possible to bring children closer to the systems used by other dialects without 
changing their personalities and their friendship patterns. From everything we have 
seen so far, this kind of deep-seated change can happen if white and Black youth are 
in contact in the early years. The way will then be open for the group to shift as a 
whole, with the convergence that is the result of mutual inﬂuence. If the contact is a 
friendly one, and we achieve true integration in the schools, the two groups may 
actually exchange socially signiﬁcant symbols, and Black children will begin to use 
the local vernacular of the white community. But even without such a thorough 
integration, we can expect that the children will learn from each other, and the present 
trend towards separation may be reversed. 
(ibid.: 21; emphasis added) 
Let’s take this apart. 
1  
Labov proposes that AAVE-speaking children shift toward other varieties of English 
as a ﬁrst step toward better performance in school and an improvement in reading 
scores for the disempowered. He sees this as an important and even primary goal. 
2 
What is needed to make this shift happen is early contact between AAVE speakers 
and speakers of other (unnamed) varieties of English. 
3 
The result of early contact – handled correctly – would be true integration, in which 
the two groups really interact. 
4  
True integration will bring about linguistic convergence and the shift away from 
AAVE, which would be better than what is now happening (the two varieties are 
becoming less alike). 
In a talk Labov gave at a conference in 2006 called “Unendangered Dialects, Endangered 
People,” he is more speciﬁc about some of his points: “[AAVE] is [the AA community’s] 
great resource, an elegant form of expression which they use when they reflect most 
thoughtfully on the oppression and misery of daily life” (Labov 2010b: 24). He goes on 
to propose a causal relationship between segregation and the existence of AAVE: “AAVE 
has developed its present form in the framework of the most extreme racial segregation 
that the world has ever known” (ibid.). Labov anticipates criticism, and makes a statement 
designed to forestall any more objections or suggestions that he is denigrating the language 
of the AAVE speaking community: “In no way have I suggested that AAVE is a cause of 
the problems of African American people” (ibid.). 
Labov’s position is that in the broadest sense, segregation is responsible for the current 
troubles in the African American community. Many would agree with this general

----- Page 221 (native) -----
196 
THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
statement. But he moves beyond this observation to draw other conclusions. Desegregation 
is crucially important; from desegregation will follow linguistic assimilation and the gradual 
disappearance of AAVE: 
If the mixed populations of our Philadelphia schools should actually be integrated, 
we may even reach a time when young black children use elements of the white 
vernacular . . . At that point, AAVE as a whole might be in danger of losing its own 
distinct and characteristic forms of speech. I expect that some among us would regret 
the loss of the eloquent syntactic and semantic options that I have presented here. 
But we might also reﬂect at that time that the loss of a dialect is a lesser evil than the 
current condition of an endangered people. 
(ibid.: 25) 
Consider the way AAVE is seen here. It is not the language of a vibrant, active community; 
it is the product of segregation. Labov uses words like resource and elegant, but he seems 
to be seeing its use as restricted to those times when African Americans “reflect most 
thoughtfully on the oppression and misery of daily life” – a very narrow and pessimistic 
view of AAVE (for a closer reading and rebuttal of many of the points in Labov’s 2007 
paper, see Rickford 2010.)15 Labov equates regressive and discriminatory practices with 
the existence, persistence and spread of AAVE. The end to segregation brings – in Labov’s 
view of the world – linguist assimilation, loss of AAVE, improved reading scores and 
generally a happier, more congenial U.S. Each of those points has been challenged 
multiple times in this book. It is hard to imagine a better example of the insidious nature 
of language ideology and the way it digs itself into otherwise open minds. 
Anglo attitudes toward AAVE are complex, because AAVE taps into the most difﬁcult 
and contentious issues around race. AAVE makes Americans uncomfortable because it is 
persistent, and because it will not go away, no matter how extreme the measures to 
denigrate and exclude. Ofﬁcial policies around this (and other) stigmatized varieties of 
language are policies of patronage and tolerance rather than acceptance. The irony is that 
AAVE is the distinctive language of a cultural community we don’t want to acknowledge 
as separate; at the same time, the only way we know how to deal with our discomfort about 
AAVE is to set it apart. 
African American attitudes toward AAVE 
Within the African American community, discussions around AAVE seem to embody 
some of the most difﬁcult and painful issues of identity and solidarity. To begin with, it 
must be stated that it is hard to ﬁnd any African American, regardless of profession, politics 
or personal belief, who would deny the practical necessity of bidialectalism and selective 
assimilation to *SAE norms. The fact that African American children with aspirations out-
side their own communities must learn a language of wider communication (Smitherman 
1995b) is acknowledged as a fact of life. Opinions on this range from sober utilitarianism 
and resignation to righteous anger:16 
Pragmatic reality forces the burden of adjustment on groups who are outside positions 
of inﬂuence and power. It does little good to claim that street speech is a valid dialect 
– which it is – when the social cost of linguistic and other differences can be so high. 
(John Baugh, linguist)

THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
197 
[O]ur position is quite clear. We believe that for people to excel they must acquire and 
use to their advantage the language of power and the language of ﬁnance. Standard 
American English is that. I admit it is not fair, but I did not create those rules. We only 
assist people in working their way up through them. 
(Dr. Bernadette Anderson, accent reduction therapist) 
The worst of all possible things that could happen would be to lose that language. 
There are certain things I cannot say without recourse to my language. It’s terrible 
to think that a child with ﬁve different present tenses comes to school to be faced with 
those books that are less than his own language. And then to be told things about his 
language, which is him, that are sometimes permanently damaging . . . This is a really 
cruel fallout of racism. I know the Standard English. I want to use it to help restore 
the other language, the lingua franca. 
(Toni Morrison, author, poet, Nobel Prize winner) 
Language is political. That’s why you and me, my Brother and Sister, that’s why we 
sposed to choke our natural self into the weird, lying, barbarous, unreal, white speech 
and writing habits that the schools lay down like holy law. Because, in other words, 
the powerful don’t play; they mean to keep that power, and those who are the power-
less (you and me) better shape up mimic/ape/suck-in the very image of the powerful, 
or the powerful will destroy you – you and our children. 
(June Jordan, poet, writer, political activist) 
Studies and interviews with African Americans indicate that while anger is rarely openly 
voiced, arguments for bidialectalism based on personal experience are quite common: 
I have some associates that find it very difficult to work and maintain any kind of 
decent job, because of the fact that they cannot adequately speak, so to speak, the 
normal language. 
(Man on the street, CBS National News, December 5, 1985) 
But my opinion always has been that you have to learn to survive in the real world, 
and if you speak Black English, there’s no way you’re going to survive. There’s no 
way you’re going to get a job that you really want. There’s no way that you’re going 
to make an income that’s going to make you live right. 
(Female university staff, interviewed for Speicher and McMahon 1992: 399) 
Clear and logical arguments for bidialectalism are made regularly, and still this issue does 
not rest its head. But this cannot be surprising. To make two statements: I acknowledge that 
my home language is viable and adequate and I acknowledge that my home language will never 
be accepted is to set up an irresolvable conﬂict. 
Alice Walker, who in her novels about African Americans often uses language issues 
to illustrate the emotional cost of assimilation, has put it more succinctly: “It seems our 
fate to be incorrect,” she said in a 1973 interview. “. . . And in our incorrectness we stand” 
(O’Brien 1973: 207). The day-to-day pressure to give up the home language is something 
that most non-AAVE speakers cannot imagine, and it is here that novelists provide insight 
into a cultural phenomenon which is otherwise inaccessible to Anglos:

Darlene tryin to teach me how to talk. She say US not so hot . . . peoples think you 
dumb. What I care? I ast. I’m happy. But she say I feel more happier talkin like she 
talk . . . Every time I say something the way I say it, she correct me until I say it some 
other way. Pretty soon it feel like I can’t think. My mind run up on a thought, git 
confuse, run back and sort of lay down . . . Look like to me only a fool would want 
you to talk in a way that feel peculiar to your mind. 
(Walker 1982) 
“I done my homework. You already seen it,” Shoni said. 
“I did my homework. You already saw it,” LaKeesha said. 
“That too,” Shoni said. Both sisters laughed. “Why you all the time be trying to get 
me to talk white?” 
“It’s not white; it’s correct.” She didn’t feel as sure as Esther and Mrs. Clark were 
when they said it. Sometimes she was a little afraid that she was talking white, that 
she could lose herself in the land where enunciation was crisp and all verbs agreed. 
And at home, especially on weekends, it was hard to hold on to that language of 
success and power . . . “When you go to work, you have to know the right way to 
speak,” she added, looking in Shoni’s eyes as if she was sure of what she was saying, 
even though she wasn’t. 
(Campbell 1994) 
Pressure to assimilate to *SAE norms originates from outside and from inside the African 
American community. In both of these excerpts, Black girls and women encourage each 
other to acquire the white language, a language, they are told, which will bring them not 
only success and power, but happiness (“But she say I feel more happier talkin like she talk”). 
To accept this proposition in the face of direct personal evidence to the contrary is the 
challenge that these ﬁctional characters, like all AAVE speakers, must somehow meet. 
Evidence of real resistance to linguistic assimilation is hard to ﬁnd outside of ﬁction. 
The most cited example is surely James Baldwin’s moving editorial “If Black English Isn’t 
a Language, Then Tell Me, What Is?” (New York Times, July 29, 1979). The writings of 
June Jordan call clearly for the recognition of the validity of AAVE. Another rare instance 
is found in the highly autobiographical account of the Simpson murder trial by the African 
American prosecutor, Christopher Darden: 
[It] isn’t to say all Black people sound alike; of course not. But who can deny that we 
have our own dialect and our own accent? . . . It seemed to me that by the time I got 
to college, we were given a choice. We could learn to speak more mainstream, to 
sound more white, or we could be proud of our heritage and acknowledge that culture 
extends to language as well as paintings and books. I was proﬁcient in English. I could 
read it and write it expertly, and I knew the rules for speaking it. And so I felt no need 
to change the way I spoke, to ignore the heritage and the background that formed 
my diction, my speech patterns, and the phrases I used. 
(Darden and Walter 1996: 77) 
The push–pull AAVE speakers must reconcile comes into real focus with the ﬁrst day of 
school, where the dominant philosophy is one that promotes code-switching. Children 
are not to be deprived of their home language (in theory); instead they learn an additional

THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
199 
language (which might be called Standard English or academic English or “the language 
of wider communication”) which is to be used outside the home and community. On the 
surface this looks to be a balanced and fair approach, but it does not bear up to close 
examination. Stanley Fish’s series of essays on higher education, his description and 
rationalization of this approach reveal it for the separate-but-equal policy it is: 
If students infected with the facile egalitarianism of soft multiculturalism declare, “I 
have a right to my own language,” reply, “Yes, you do, and I am not here to take that 
language from you; I’m here to teach you another one.” (Who could object to learning 
a second language?) And then get on with it. 
(Fish 2009) 
A growing body of work challenges the institutionalized belief that giving up AAVE is 
necessary for African American students to succeed in traditional academic settings (Young 
2007; Young and Martinez 2011). Quite to the contrary, Young et al. believe that a reliance 
on code-switching is counterproductive: 
[Code-switching] actually facilitates the illiteracy and failure that educators seek to 
eliminate, promotes resistance to standard English rather than encourage its use, and 
further stifles the expression of lucid prose from people whose first language is 
something other than English. 
Young and Martinez propose that the reasoning behind code switching represents 
“acceptance, advocacy, and teaching of an outmoded view of literacy that stems from 
dominant language ideology, a belief that places a colonial vision/version of language 
above all others, if not ideologically, definitely practically” (ibid.). Code-meshing, in 
contrast, does not set up artiﬁcial boundaries between varieties of English,17 nor does it 
try to reconcile a policy of afﬁrming a child’s right to his or her own language18 with a 
policy that devalues AAVE (for example) and privileges *SAE. 
Most efforts to seek public validation of AAVE are less visible, and still are met with a 
great deal of resistance. An African American journalist responds in an opinion piece to 
such a group organized in the Midwest: 
In Madison, Wisconsin, for example, some Blacks are trying to push the value of BEV, 
according to a recent report in the Wisconsin State Journal. They want to change the 
way professionals, teachers and the government view the lazy verbiage of the ghetto. 
The group argues that Black English is merely different, not a disability. 
I disagree with that. I think it is dysfunctional to promote BEV – or even legitimate 
it with an acronym. And the dysfunction exists not so much among the students as 
with their ill-equipped African American “leaders” and educators. 
(Hamblin 1995) 
Some successful African Americans (for example, John Baugh and Bernadette Anderson, 
above) acknowledge the schism between promises and threats, but are resigned to the 
fact that there is nothing practical to be done about it. Others rationalize linguistic 
subordination in a number of ways. Denial – the simple refusal to admit to the existence 
of AAVE – is not uncommon: “There is no such thing as Black English. The concept of

----- Page 225 (native) -----
200 
THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
Black English is a myth. It is basically speaking English and violating the correct rules of 
grammar” (Male audience member, Oprah Winfrey Show, 1987). 
We have seen that AAVE is not accepted, and may never be accepted as a socially viable 
language by the majority of U.S. English speakers. Thus, for AAVE speakers one of the 
two statements (I acknowledge that my home language is viable and expressive and 
sufﬁcient to all my needs and I acknowledge that my home language will never be accepted) 
cannot stand. One of these positions must be challenged or amended if the conﬂict is to 
be resolved.19 Extreme examples of this are available, even in print: 
Although we were surrounded in New York by a number of poorly spoken and 
frequently stereotypical Black and poor Southern dialects, my siblings and I soon 
learned to hear it for what it was – the language of the street, the language of Black 
trash. The language that went right along with Saturday-night knife ﬁghts to settle 
a grudge. 
(Hamblin 1995) 
Rachel Jones (1990) does not deny the existence of AAVE, but she does refuse to admit 
that any successful African American might speak it. In her view, Malcolm X, Martin 
Luther King, Jr., Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, James Baldwin, Andrew Young, Tom 
Bradley and Barbara Jordan do not talk Black or not Black; they “talk right.” For Jones, 
the fact that most of these African Americans depend on AAVE intonation, phonology, 
and rhetorical features to mark their spoken language for solidarity with the Black 
community is irrelevant. In this way, the definition of AAVE becomes very narrow: it 
encompasses only the grammar of the language in so far as syntactical and morphological 
rules are distinct from *SAE. 
The rationalizations found here and elsewhere are well-established steps in the language 
subordination process. Note the appeal to written language norms as a source of authority, 
the mystiﬁcation of grammar and disinformation in the following: 
What Black children need is an end to this malarkey that tells them they can fail to 
learn grammar, fail to develop vocabularies, ignore syntax and embrace the mumbo-
jumbo of ignorance – and dismiss it in the name of “Black pride.” 
(Rowan 1979: 36) 
Here Rowan, a journalist, has stated his belief that AAVE speakers must be taught 
grammar because, apparently, they do not acquire any to start with; that they have 
insufﬁcient lexicons; and that their language functions without syntax. These statements 
are misinformed, and lean primarily on that part of the mystiﬁcation process which would 
have native speakers of a language hand over authority: 
I’m a Northwestern student presently, and I got to be a Northwestern student because 
of my grammar and because of the way I can speak. Black English may have had its 
place back in the times of slavery, back in the times when we had no way of educating 
ourselves . . . now we do have a way of educating ourselves, and I think by speaking 
the way [an AAVE speaker] speaks, you are downgrading society. You are saying that 
you don’t want to educate yourself. We have a different way to educate ourselves 
today. 
(Female audience member, Oprah Winfrey Show, 1987)

201 
There is an interesting equation in this young woman’s statement. She tells the audience 
that she was able to study at a prestigious university because of the variety of English she 
speaks; that is, because she does not speak AAVE. From this we might conclude that any 
*SAE speaker can gain admittance to Northwestern on that basis alone, which is an obvious 
error. People are admitted to a university on the basis of grades, test scores, and essays, 
among other things; performance in school and on standardized tests follows in great part 
from a command of the written language, a skill not acquired equally well by all *SAE 
speakers. The audience member has moved from spoken language to written language 
without even making note, and she then moves on to the assumption that education, if 
effective, will negate language differences, which must equal poor language, which in turn 
“downgrades society.” 
It is worth noting that another young African American woman in the audience, an 
AAVE speaker, points out to this Northwestern student that there is a material difference 
between written and spoken languages, but her statement is ignored. 
The association of AAVE with slavery is not an uncommon one, and it is perhaps the 
most difﬁcult one to address. The exact origins of AAVE are unclear, and the source of 
great debate among linguists. That the African American diaspora was crucial in the 
development of the language is undeniable, but it does not follow from this historical fact 
that the language is now dysfunctional or has no good purpose. Later in the Winfrey taping, 
Smitherman points out that the language developed as a vehicle of solidarity in a time of 
oppression. 
This excerpt is a particularly interesting one in ideological terms: 
I do not approve of Black English. In the ﬁrst place, I do not understand it; in the 
second place, I think the objective of education is to lead out. I think that in our society 
– though we ought to take advantage of the cultural differences that really make 
Americans American – we ought to eliminate those differences which are either the 
basis or result of divisiveness in our society. 
(Donald McHenry, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, 
in Jet 1980: 57(25): 40, cited in Starks 1983: 99–100) 
The statement is interesting in the way it is similar to the criticisms of Anglos. First, this 
is the only time I have been able to document an African American citing communication 
difﬁculties as a reason to reject AAVE. Even those most vehemently negative about the 
language generally admit that it is comprehensible, or do not touch on this issue at all. 
McHenry also draws in arguments often heard in the debate on bilingualism and the 
English-Only movement. These include questions about what it means to be an American 
citizen, and the often-stated fear that the nation-state cannot survive willful refusal to 
assimilate to supra-regional norms. This is not a new complaint; in 1966 the Superintendent 
of Public Instruction of California went on record with his prediction of complete 
breakdown of communication: “Correct English just has to be taught to the next generation 
unless we want a reply of the Tower of Babel bit around 1984” (cited in Drake 1977: 91). 
McHenry restates the common belief that the only way to achieve the ideal society is 
to become a homogenous one, and to this end we must eliminate not all differences, but 
those which are unacceptable and divisive. The conflict between the wants of 
peripheralized groups and the needs of the majority are raised here quite clearly. But there 
is a question which is not addressed: the connection between language and those basic 
human rights which are protected by law from the tyranny of majority rule.

THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
There is no doubt that there is great internal conﬂict in the African American com-
munity centered around AAVE. Those who are bidialectal feel the need to justify their 
choice to be so; Blacks who are not comfortable speaking AAVE are often defensive about 
their language, and protective of their status as members of the Black community. The 
greater African American community seems to accept the inevitability of linguistic 
assimilation to *SAE in certain settings, but there is also evidence of mistrust of Blacks 
who assimilate too well: 
Suspicion and skepticism are common Black reactions to Black users of LWC [the 
language of wider communication, or *SAE] rhetorical styles. These perceptions exist 
simultaneously with the belief that one needs to master LWC in order to “get ahead.” 
I call it “linguistic push–pull”; Du Bois calls it “double consciousness.” The farther 
removed one is from mainstream “success,” the greater the degree of cynicism about 
this ethnolinguistic, cultural ambivalence. Jesse Jackson knows about this; so did 
Malcolm X and Martin Luther King; so does Louis Farrakhan. The oratory of each 
is LWC in its grammar but AVT in its rhetorical style. 
(Smitherman 1995b: 238) 
On occasion, African Americans have gone on record with their own experiences as 
bidialectal speakers. Those experiences are seldom benign: 
Hearing the laughter . . . and being the butt of “proper” and “oreo” jokes hurt me. 
Being criticized made me feel marginal – and verbally impotent in the sense that I 
had little ammunition to stop the frequent lunchtime attacks. So I did what was 
necessary to ﬁt in, whether that meant cursing excessively or signifying. Ultimately I 
somehow learned to be polylingual and to become sensitive linguistically in the way 
that animals are able to sense the danger of bad weather. 
The need to defend myself led me to use language as a weapon to deﬂect jokes about 
the “whiteness” of my spoken English and to launch harsh verbal counter-attacks. 
Simultaneously language served as a mask to hide the hurt I often felt in the process. 
Though over time my ability to “talk that talk” – slang – gained me a new respect from 
my peers, I didn’t want to go through life using slang to prove I am Black. So I decided 
“I yam what I yam,” and to take pride in myself. I am my speaking self, but this doesn’t 
mean that I’m turning my back on Black people. There are various shades of Blackness; 
I don’t have to talk like Paul Laurence Dunbar’s dialect poems to prove I’m Black. I 
don’t appreciate anyone’s trying to take away the range of person I can be. 
(Aponte 1989) 
It seems that African Americans who speak *SAE are not immune from a different kind 
of trouble: Aponte’s experiences and reactions to those experiences are perhaps the best 
possible illustration of push–pull, and his story seems to be a common one. Blacks who 
speak primarily AAVE are subject to ongoing pressure to assimilate to *SAE norms in a 
number of settings outside their communities; in fact, they are threatened with exclusion 
if they do not. Blacks who do not speak AAVE may be treated with skepticism and distrust 
by other African Americans. Language ideology becomes a double-edged sword for those 
who are monodialectal – threats originate from inside and outside the home language 
community.

At this point it is necessary to consider that there are many persons of African descent 
resident in the U.S. who are immigrants from the Caribbean and from Africa, and who 
come to this country speaking another language entirely. Within the indigenous African 
American community there is a complicated set of reactions to these immigrants which 
can be overtly negative, in ways which are not always visible to outsiders. Edwidge 
Danticat’s (1994) novel, Breath, Eyes, Memory brought these issues into the consciousness 
of the public. Her story of the Haitian experience in the U.S. makes clear how important 
a role language plays in the negotiations between African Americans and immigrants of 
African descent: 
My mother said it was important that I learn English quickly. Otherwise the American 
students would make fun of me or, even worse, beat me. A lot of other mothers from 
the nursing home where she worked had told her that their children were getting into 
ﬁghts in school because they were accused of having “HBO” – Haitian Body Odor. 
Many of the American kids even accused Haitians of having AIDS because they had 
heard on television that only the four H’s got AIDS – heroin addicts, hemophiliacs, 
homosexuals and Haitians. I wanted to tell my mother that I didn’t want to go to 
school. Frankly, I was afraid. 
(NPR, All Things Considered, September 30, 1994) 
Her experiences (as well as documented experiences of other Haitian immigrants) indicate 
that there is a hierarchy among immigrants who come into the African American 
community, and the Haitians are very low in the pecking order. How AAVE ﬁts into the 
complex issue of acquisition of English for native speakers of Haitian Creole and other 
Caribbean and African languages is something which has not yet been explored in depth, 
but which deserves to be studied both as a linguistic issue and a social one. 
It would be useful, in this context, to look at the way prominent African Americans deal 
with the conﬂict inherent to the choice between languages. In the ﬁrst edition of this book 
I provided a close reading of a 1987 Oprah Winfrey taping entitled “Black English.” Much 
of that discussion had to be left out of this second edition, because Harpo Productions 
(Winfrey’s production company) decided to no longer allow me to use extended examples. 
I have edited that discussion to stay within the bounds of fair use, but for anyone who 
would like to read it in its entirety, I suggest locating a copy of the ﬁrst edition. 
The second example I include here is an episode related by Shelby Steele in his 1991 
book The Content of Our Characters.20 The Oprah Winfrey taping was live, with an audience 
that was primarily African American. The experts invited to contribute to the conversation 
were two black women (Dr. Geneva Smithermann, a linguist specializing in AAVE) and 
Dr. Bernadette Anderson, a professional accent reduction specialist. The third guest was 
a white male, a professional radio news broadcaster. 
It is important to remember that Oprah is not impartial on this subject. She has 
demonstrated her comfort speaking AAVE in a number of contexts, while she uses a more 
formal English in most public situations. During this ﬁlming she acted as a host to her 
invited guests, a facilitator to the audience discussion, and simultaneously as a participant 
with opinions of her own. The introductions she reads from cue cards are perhaps not 
entirely her own formulations; her statements may sometimes be made in a spirit of 
fostering discussion. But in general, it is clear that she is willing to give her opinion on 
the questions at hand: on occasion she claims the ﬂoor when audience members want to 
speak. Her comments are peppered with formulations such as I know, to me, I think, I don’t

----- Page 229 (native) -----
204 
THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
understand. She also uses constructions like if you don’t know, you must know, don’t you know, 
in those instances where she puts her own opinions forth. Her tone is not coercive, but it 
does border on the frustrated and pleading at times. 
At the time the segment in question was filmed, Winfrey’s stance on AAVE was a 
complex and conﬂicted one. At ﬁrst glance, it might seem that she stands ﬁrmly on the 
side of standardization and linguistic assimilation. As has been seen with other African 
Americans, she does not directly deny the existence of AAVE (which she consistently calls 
“so-called” Black English, perhaps because she is uncomfortable with the term rather than 
the language itself), but she challenges AAVE using many of the strategies seen earlier in 
this book. 
She first attempts to relegate AAVE to the realm of the secondary: “Are we talking 
about correct English or are we talking about dialect?”; when audience members protest 
this, she regroups by deﬁning for them the difference between Black English and *SAE, 
a difference which turns out to rest exclusively on subject–verb agreement. She deﬁnes 
*SAE very simply: in *SAE, verbs and subjects agree. She asks the audience if a person 
should feel ashamed for speaking *SAE, for choosing “to speak correctly.” 
Winfrey seems to have a definition of AAVE which focuses only on grammatical 
agreement and excludes phonology and rhetorical devices. She identiﬁes Martin Luther 
King, Jr., Whitney Young, Mary McCleod Bethune as speakers not of Black English, but 
of *SAE. Once again, Jesse Jackson is raised as an example of someone who speaks AAVE 
but knows how to shift in his public discourse to a style appropriate for the most formal 
settings. The fact that Jesse Jackson strongly marks his public discourse with AAVE 
rhetorical devices, and sometimes uses AAVE grammatical strategies regardless of his 
audience, does not come up. 
She quotes Jackson’s famous statement that “excellence is the best deterrent to racism” 
but fails to discuss her equation between lack of excellence and the primary language of 
the African American community. 
Winfrey focuses the discussion of Black English on the social repercussions this 
language brings with it in the world outside the African American community. She seems 
truly distraught and dismayed when young African Americans in the audience tell her that 
they want to use their own functional language and reject pressure to assimilate. Here, 
Winfrey’s own status as a successful business woman and employer of many seems to push 
to the forefront. Given her own position, she does not understand young Blacks who still 
voice their resistance to assimilation. In fact, she challenges a white panelist on this count: 
“Let me ask you, why would you want to tell Black people or make Black people believe 
that corporate America is going to change for them?” 
Winfrey justifies her rejection of AAVE based on the documented history of its 
reception. However, when call-in viewers or audience members who agree with this basic 
premise move on to openly deride AAVE, she momentarily switches allegiance. In four 
cases there are comments from whites which cause her to pause and come to the defense 
of AAVE or AAVE speakers. She sometimes does this with humor, but there is also 
tangible uneasiness when the discussion moves beyond grammar to statements which are 
at the very least intolerant, and in some cases tip over the line into racism. 
The arguments put forth by those who call in (none of whom are AAVE speakers) to 
the show fall into four categories: 
African Americans choose to set themselves aside; if they are excluded, it’s because 
they want to be. 
1

205 
2 
African Americans are ignorant because they can say the word “ask,” because to say 
“aks” is to confuse the listener. Here Winfrey points out that if the caller understands 
the word “aks” in context, what exactly is the problem? 
3 
African Americans are ungrateful. If they don’t want to speak proper English, they 
should go back to Africa. Winfrey’s objection here is quick and to the point when she 
repeats a point made by Dr. Smithermann: What country do Black people go to? 
4 
African Americans have a right to speak incorrectly if they want to, but other people 
shouldn’t be forced to suffer and listen to it. Winfrey asks for clariﬁcation: how does 
AAVE cause the speaker to suffer? 
Overall, Winfrey’s stance is complicated by her own place in corporate institutions, where 
there are gatekeeping mechanisms she subscribes to and openly promotes. For example, 
she asserts that employers (of which she is one) have the right to demand that employees 
represent employers as they wish to be represented, a right which she believes extends to 
language. When audience and panel members point out her fallacies in common-sense 
arguments, or present counter-arguments, Winfrey has one of three strategies: 
1 
She appeals to the authority of those panel or audience members who support her 
position, primarily to Dr. Anderson, the accent reduction specialist. 
2 
She counters with more common-sense but factually fragile arguments. 
3 
Or she cuts away completely, as when an audience member stands to admonish other 
African Americans to reject the idea that they are ignorant or don’t speak right. 
Winfrey’s discomfort with the underlying conflict reaches its peak when audience 
members attempt to use her and her language as an example of the necessity of assimilation 
and the rewards which follow. It is interesting that the African American guests who hold 
up Winfrey’s language as a model never point out that Winfrey herself, like so many other 
African Americans prominent in the public eye, is often heard to use AAVE intonation 
when speaking with Black guests, and that she relies on AAVE rhetorical devices on many 
occasions. 
Winfrey would like the issue to be a simple one of grammatical relations, which would 
allow her to make decisions as an employer which would be free of racial implications. 
Ideally, she believes, education should neutralize language distinctions stemming from 
differences in race and class. She has the best interest of her community and people in 
mind, and a clear picture of the steps necessary for African Americans to achieve economic 
and social equality. She seems to see a role for herself here, in educating those who come 
after as a part of the process called dropping knowledge within the African American 
community. She has traveled this road herself, after all. She has made choices, some of 
which raise hard questions: “Does it mean that you are ashamed because you choose to 
speak correctly, you choose to have your verbs agree with your subject?” 
When she is confronted with evidence that there is a connection between identity and 
language choice, that negative reactions against AAVE have not to do with the message, 
but the messenger, her ability to rationalize her choices and the reality of linguistic 
assimilation is challenged. 
Shelby Steele provides very different insights into the conflicts which face African 
Americans. Steele is one of a group of prominent scholars and writers who form the core 
of an African American conservative think tank, who have been public in their criticism 
of the civil rights establishment. Some of the central ideas of this body of work include

----- Page 231 (native) -----
206 
THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
the supposition that human nature is more important than race, and that national interest 
is more important than ethnic afﬁliation. His The Content of Our Characters is interesting 
here because he addresses, in a limited way, the issue of language. His discussion illustrates 
the way that rationalization works in the language subordination process. Steele’s current 
position on AAVE, although never clearly stated, seems to be assimilationist. What he 
relates in his essay is the logic which allows him to make the transition from accepting his 
own language as viable and functional to rejecting it. 
As a teenager, Steele was a speaker of AAVE in public situations which included non-
AAVE speakers. The story he tells here is probably a fairly typical experience for young 
Blacks when they establish social contacts outside the African American community. Here, 
an older white woman continually and repeatedly corrects both AAVE grammatical and 
phonological features in his speech: 
When I was fourteen the mother of a white teammate on the YMCA swimming team 
would – in a nice but insistent way – correct my grammar when I lapsed into the Black 
English I’d grown up speaking in the neighborhood. She would require that my verbs 
and pronouns agree, that I put the “g” on my “ings,” and that I say “that” instead of 
“dat.” She absolutely abhorred double negatives, and her face would screw up in pain 
at the sound of one. But her corrections also tapped my racial vulnerability. I felt racial 
shame at this white woman’s fastidious concern with my language. It was as though 
she was saying that the Black part of me was not good enough, would not do, and this 
is where my denial went to work. 
Steele’s initial reaction is anger at the woman’s rejection of “the Black part of me [as] not 
good enough.” This episode seems to have been his ﬁrst direct experience with language-
focused discrimination. Thus he confronts the conﬂict between the experience of being 
discriminated against and his experiences with AAVE as a viable and functional language. 
As a 14-year-old, then, Steele was not yet convinced that AAVE was an inappropriate or 
bad language. Corresponding to his anger toward the woman is a recognition of the link 
between it and his race (“the Black part of me”). On this basis, his early conclusion is that 
the woman who has corrected him is racist. 
Now, he does something perhaps unusual. He confronts the woman through her son, 
and she seeks him out angrily to have a conversation about her motives in correcting his 
language: 
A few days later she marched into the YMCA rec room, took me away from a Ping-
Pong game, and sat me down in a corner. It was the late ﬁfties, when certain women 
painted their faces as though they were canvases . . . it was the distraction of this mask, 
my wonderment at it, that allowed me to keep my equilibrium. 
She told me about herself, that she had grown up poor, had never ﬁnished high school, 
and would never be more than a secretary. She said she didn’t give a “good goddamn” 
about my race, but that if I wanted to do more than “sweat my life away in a steel 
mill,” I better learn to speak correctly. As she continued to talk I was shocked to realize 
that my comment had genuinely hurt her and that her motive in correcting my 
English has been no more than simple human kindness. If she had been Black, I might 
have seen this more easily. But she was white, and this fact alone set off a very speciﬁc 
response pattern in which vulnerability to a racial shame was the trigger, denial and 
recomposition the reaction, and a distorted view of the situation the result. This was

----- Page 232 (native) -----
THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
207 
the sequence by which I converted kindness into harassment and my racial shame into 
her racism. 
First note that his original position has reversed on a number of levels:

race and language 
This is an interesting example of how ideology functions to cloak the truth. Steele is 
recounting the way in which he was made aware of his position as subordinate, and chose 
to change his allegiance to the dominant group. There is no doubt that he is sincere about 
the story that he tells, or that he truly believes the common-sense arguments he puts forth. 
But he uses a number of coercive strategies to manufacture consent from his audience, 
and they bear consideration. One is the way that Steele attempts to make his readers 
believe that there is a commonality of opinion regarding language. He knows, as they 
surely do, that AAVE is an inadequate language: 
If she had been Black, I might have seen [the truth] more easily. But she was white, 
and this fact alone set off a very speciﬁc response pattern in which vulnerability to a 
racial shame was the trigger, denial and recomposition the reaction, and a distorted 
view of the situation the result. 
Steele assumes that his readers will share some basic beliefs: 
that there is a right and a wrong way to use English; 
that it is appropriate for more established and knowledgeable persons to direct younger 
ones to that better language; 
that questions of right and wrong in language move beyond race. 
Further, Steele explains his inability to see these facts as a function of his immature view 
of the world and his unwillingness to accept personal responsibility (“If she had been Black, 
I might have seen this more easily”). His youthful AAVE speaking self relies on denial of 
the basic truth about language; his mature and reasonable self (the one who is like his 
readers) knows the truth of the matter. Thus, by linking the last logical proposition 
(questions of right and wrong move beyond race) to the ﬁrst two (there is a good and a 
bad language, and it is appropriate to censure users of bad language), he coerces a certain 
degree of acceptance of his language ideology. 
Steele relates this conversation with the mother of a friend as a kind of epiphany, in 
which he becomes aware of truths not just about himself, but about people in general. In 
this way Steele himself and this woman function as imaginary formations (Haidar and 
Rodríguez 1995). Imaginary formations are understood as the way the subject (Steele), his 
interlocutor (the readers), and the object of their discourse (the woman who corrected 
him, and her motivations) are represented not as individuals, but as symbols of larger

----- Page 233 (native) -----
208 
THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
groups or types. In this analytical approach, a person perceives and projects him or herself 
primarily as a representative of their speciﬁc place in the social structure. Thus, Steele 
represents himself as a successful African American who has moved beyond denial and 
racism to take responsibility for his own life. 
More interesting, perhaps, is the imaginary formation of the white woman who leads 
him to accept the necessity of rejecting his home language. This woman is by her own 
account (and one he obviously does not disagree with) someone with little to recommend 
her: she has never ﬁnished high school and will never achieve a great deal of economic 
success; she even looks clownish. She has not accepted or recognized sources of authority 
or knowledge, beyond a history of personal difﬁculty and sacriﬁce. But because she is an 
*SAE speaker, she feels authorized to correct his language because if she does not do so, 
he is doomed to a life “in a steel mill.” She tells him these things not because she has any 
investment in him (she denies such a motivation), but out of some greater urge to do good, 
an urge which is sufﬁcient authority for Steele. This woman represents the hard-working, 
well-meaning middle American *SAE speaker who knows best, and whose authority is not 
to be questioned. She was the mother of a friend, but she has transcended that role to 
become an imaginary formation. 
There are various ways individuals attempt to neutralize Smitherman’s “linguistic 
push–pull” and Du Bois’ “double consciousness” (Du Bois 1897 [2007]), but Steele takes 
a step which moves beyond denying or limiting AAVE. Whereas Winfrey was clearly 
unable to go along with criticisms of AAVE which devalued the messenger rather than 
the message, Steele accepts the criticism of the messenger as appropriate, along with 
rationalizations and beyond that, safeguards which anticipate challenges. If you question 
or reject the common-sense arguments which underlie his position, you are practicing 
denial and recomposition. The rejection of arguments for linguistic assimilation is thus 
projected as racist. 
What do Oprah Winfrey and Shelby Steele – along with all the other African Americans 
who have spoken out on the matter of the languages of the African American community 
– have in common? Perhaps only two things can be pinpointed with any surety: the need 
to resolve the conﬂict, and the complexity of their responses. It seems that in every case, 
opinions are formed by personal experiences outside the African American community 
which are often overtly negative. It cannot be denied that some of the most scornful and 
negative criticism of AAVE speakers comes from other African Americans. 
Consider Oprah Winfrey, who insists on the necessity of *SAE verb paradigms, for 
example. Despite her ﬁrm stand on these issues, she does not advocate for the abandon-
ment of all AAVE rhetorical features, intonation or lexical choice, as she herself uses these 
on occasion and she points to other African Americans who do the same as good language 
models. *SAE speakers, on the other hand, in particular Anglo *SAE speakers, have a much 
lower tolerance for non-grammatical features of AAVE than some seem to realize, 
something that needs to be examined in the larger context of linguistic proﬁling. This is 
an area which requires further study and research, because it is not until speakers become 
aware of differences in perceptions that the underlying conﬂicts can be addressed. 
Where we at 
The observations and conclusions in this chapter will make many people unhappy and 
others mad. Our common culture tells us constantly that to fulﬁll democratic ideals the

209 
nation must be homogeneous and indivisible. In the 1960s, the courts put an ofﬁcial end 
to racial segregation in schooling, housing, public places, and the workplace. What does 
it mean then to say that there is an African American culture distinct enough from other 
American cultures to have its own variety of English, a variety that persists in spite of 
stigmatization of the most demeaning and caustic kind, and despite repercussions in the 
form of real disadvantage and discrimination? 
AAVE is a source of controversy between the African American community and the 
rest of the country, and within the African American community itself, because it throws 
a bright light on issues that are too difﬁcult or uncomfortable to deal with. Equal rights 
and equal access are good and important goals, but the cost is high. Perhaps it is too high. 
Clearly, AAVE speakers get something from their communities and from each other that 
is missing in the world which is held up to them as superior and better. But the conﬂict 
remains. “We’re not wrong,” says an exasperated AAVE speaker in response to criticism. 
“I’m tired of living in a country where we’re always wrong.” 
The real trouble with Black English is not the verbal aspect system which distinguishes 
it from other varieties of U.S. English, or the rhetorical strategies which draw such a vivid 
contrast, it is simply this: AAVE is tangible and irrefutable evidence that there is a distinct, 
healthy, functioning African American culture which is not white, and which does not 
want to be white. James Baldwin, who wrote and spoke so eloquently of the issues at the 
heart of the racial divide in this country, put it quite simply: “the value [of] a Black man 
is proven by one thing only – his devotion to white people” (Baldwin 1985b: 5). 
The real problem with AAVE is a general unwillingness to accept the speakers of that 
language and the social choices they have made as viable and functional. Instead we 
relegate their experiences and capabilities and most damaging, their potential to spheres 
which are secondary and out of the public eye. We are ashamed of them and because they 
are part of us, we are ashamed of ourselves. 
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
This chapter does not include a discussion of the AAVE speech or expressive language 
features which are so distinctive. Examples include verbal routines and rituals such as 
preaching, signifying, boasting, toasting, and call-and-response. Pick one of these and 
consult the works cited here to compose a brief description with examples. 
What misconceptions did you have about AAVE before you began reading this chapter 
and/or any additional reading? Do you think these readings and discussions will have 
any long-term effect on your own beliefs and reactions? 
If you are a native speaker of AAVE and you are comfortable doing so, take questions 
from your classmates who are unfamiliar with that language. You must be the one to offer 
this possibility to the class, so that there is no hint of coercion. 
Discuss the concept of Hip Hop Nation and the role of language as a tool in that social 
movement (Smitherman 1999 provides a good starting place). 
Read Jordan’s (1995b) “Nobody Mean More to Me Than You and the Future Life of Willie 
Jordan” and prepare to discuss the following issues: (a) How does Jordan’s classroom 
method compare to Young’s code-meshing approach? How similar or different are her 
methods and philosophy compared to code-meshing? (b) Do you think her position on

THE REAL TROUBLE WITH BLACK LANGUAGE 
AAVE in the classroom is visionary, self-deceptive, naïve, bellicose, ethically sound, 
unrealistic, all/some/none of the above? 
What would it take to implement a code-meshing approach in public school classrooms? 
Can you anticipate criticisms or objections and respond to them before the fact? 
Compare Price’s (2009) sports column to the excerpts from Greene’s sports column 
discussed in this chapter. In both cases, professional sports broadcasters are expressing 
negative, even racist opinions about professional athletes who are also native AAVE 
speakers. The journalists who are quoted in Price’s column are African American; Greene 
is not: 
Let’s be honest. Many of these guys are just flat-out uneducated, which just 
speaks to the hypocrisy of the “student-athlete” system. If they tried to go up there 
and speak properly – without major training – some would be too uncomfortable, 
nervous and self-conscious to say anything worthwhile . . . this problem has to be 
ﬁxed before they get to college – or they’ve got to undergo some training once 
they get there. I suspect, though, that some whites are sometimes too scared to 
correct them for fear of being called racists for “criticizing the way Blacks talk.” 
(a) How is it that these African American journalists feel entitled or obligated to criticize 
the athletes’ language? 
(b) Do you think it’s correct to say that Anglos don’t voice similar criticisms because 
they are afraid of being called racist? 
(c) If Greene’s column is racist, as suggested in this chapter, are the African American 
journalists also being racist? 
Consider the central question of critical language theory: How do people come to invest 
in their own unhappiness? Or, as Woodson puts it more emphatically (and perhaps, 
controversially): “Here we ﬁnd that the Negro has failed to recover from his slavish habit 
of berating his own and worshipping others as perfect beings” (Woodson 1933: 84). How 
do these statements relate (a) to each other; and (b) to Greene’s and Price’s columns? 
Read Toni Cade Bambara’s short story “My Man Bovanne,” which is told from the point 
of view of a middle-aged African American woman in conﬂict with her adult children. Note 
how AAVE is used for the dialog of some characters but not others. Bambara is a native 
AAVE speaker, and made those decisions consciously. 
(a) Given the overall theme of the story, how does the variable use of AAVE serve to 
illustrate the conﬂict? 
(b) How many features of AAVE described in this chapter can you identify in “My Man 
Bovanne?” Are there other features that are not described here? 
Notes 
1 African American scholars who study AAVE across types of language communities 
tend to use the term “Black Language” rather than “Black English” (the term used in 
the ﬁrst edition of this chapter). Alim (2004a: 17) uses the term Black Language “to 
denote both language structure and language use. Viewing Language this way allows 
us to conceptualize BL as a distinct set of structural features and communicative norms 
and practices.”

2 Suggestions on where to start if you are interested in learning more about the history 
and grammar of AAVE follow at the end of the chapter. 
3 This subject will come up again in a later chapter with the discussion of Baugh’s work 
on linguistic proﬁling in the housing industry (2000). 
4 Other varieties of American English have distinct intonation patterns. See Dumas 
(1999) on stress patterns in Southern Mountain English. 
5 There is a complicated relationship between AAVE and other varieties of U.S. English, 
few aspects of which can be explored here. One important and divisive issue is the 
selective appropriation of AAVE lexical items into other varieties of English. 
Appropriation and its counterpart, supportive assimilation, are subjects which need to 
be explored systematically and objectively. This subject was raised also in the discussion 
of African Americans and linguistic proﬁling in animated ﬁlm. 
6 Linguists tend to use the term African American Vernacular English (AAVE) or 
African American English (AAE), but there are many other variants that are widely 
used; Black English Vernacular (BEV) is probably one of the most common. 
7 For further reading on Mock Spanish, see the recommendations at the end of this 
chapter. 
8 As far as I am aware, there is no body of work on how Latino or Asian communities 
hear or interpret AAVE, or what values are attached to AAVE speakers. As I cannot 
extrapolate that information from the available data, I have to restrict my analysis to 
Anglos. 
9 The representation of African Americans in entertainment was touched upon in 
Chapter 6, but the subject is a very large and complex one. Any real examination would 
have to include consideration of age-grading. 
10 Metathesis is the process by which letters, sounds or symbols are transposed, as in the 
change of Old English brid to Modern English bird. 
11 The movie My Cousin Vinnie is set in the South, with two main characters who are 
Italian-American New Yorkers with very strong accents. This is one of the few ﬁctional 
treatments that purposefully draws attention to stigmatized features of Anglo English 
that I’m aware of, and well worth watching. 
12 At the end of this chapter you will ﬁnd another news column on the subject of athletes’ 
use of AAVE. 
13 Eagleton has argued that literature has a singular relationship to the ideological pro-
cess. He ﬁnds it to be: 
the most revealing mode of experiential access to ideology that we possess. It is in 
literature, above all, that we observe in a peculiarly complex, coherent, intensive 
and immediate fashion the working of ideology in the textures of lived experience 
of class-societies. 
(1976: 101) 
The representation of spoken dialect in written fiction is a very large and complex 
topic. See especially the work of Dennis Preston on this issue. 
14 Labov has produced a tremendous body of work on AAVE, from multiple angles. He 
has been deeply involved in attempts to improve AAVE speakers’ academic achieve-
ment and reading scores by means of individualized reading programs. His concern 
for the well-being of the students and their community is genuine and deeply felt, but 
it is also rife with SLI potholes. 
15 Academics in a dozen different disciplines have taken up the question of explaining 
and proposing solutions for solving the reading-related problems of the African 
American children. Language and grammar are rarely mentioned, but poverty plays

a central role (Cavanaugh 2007; Hochschild 2003; Hodgkinson 2002; Ludwig et al. 
2001; Taylor et al. 2003). 
16 See Baugh (1983: 122); Oprah Winfrey Show (1989: 2); LeClaire (1994: 123–124); 
Jordan (1989). 
17 This is relevant not just to speakers of stigmatized varieties of English, but also to 
those who would generally be said to speak *SAE. Graff notes that his middle-class, 
middle-American students’ attempts to write formally resulted in awkward, turgid 
prose because they were forced to abandon the language they knew for one that was 
foreign to them (Graff forthcoming). 
18 Both academics and educators have written widely on the subject of afﬁrming the home 
language of students (Freeman 1975; Kinloch 2005; Parks 2000; Scott and National 
Council of Teachers of English 2009; Sledd 1983; Smitherman 1995b). 
19 There is a third option for individuals who speak stigmatized language varieties, and 
that is simple avoidance and isolation. Rather than subject themselves to mockery or 
rejection, sometimes speakers of such languages will simply refuse to engage. This is 
true in all language communities. 
20 I am thankful to John Baugh for directing my attention to Shelby Steele’s writings, 
which he also analyzed in part in his 1994 NWAVE presentation at Stanford.

Hillbillies, hicks, and Southern belles 11 
The language rebels1 
The South eagerly deﬁnes itself against the North, advertising itself as more earthy, 
more devoted to family values, more spiritual, and then is furious to have things turned 
around, to hear itself called hick, phony, and superstitious. The South feeds the sense 
of difference and then resists the consequences. 
Ayers et al. (1996: 63–64)2 
Defining the South 
Drawing a map of any kind is not a neutral exercise. Every mapmaker brings a set of goals, 
presumptions and generalizations to the task. The purpose may be simply to gather data 
for others to use in their work, as was the case with traditional dialectology; these days it 
is more likely that a linguist takes an interest in mapping variation over space as one step 
in a larger investigation (Figure 11.1). 
Regional variation shown on dialect maps is usually based one or more kinds of data: 
linguistic perception, linguistic production, and listener perception. Not even the most 
ambitious language atlases attempt to map all three of these dimensions. Any attempt to 
draw the geographic, cultural, political or linguistic boundaries of what we call the Southern 
United States would have to take in all these theoretical and practical considerations, and 
it would still be impossible to put a line on the map and declare it absolute (Table 11.1).3 
However, there are a few features that almost all the Southern varieties of American 
English have in common, salient and distinct markers of the South. These are three of 
many features that outsiders will try to use when imitating someone from the South. That 
is, this is what most Northerners expect to hear when venturing South of the Mason– 
Dixon line: 
1 
the merger of /i/ and /e/ before nasal sounds (so that “pin” and “pen” are both “pin,” 
“hem” and “him” are both “him,” etc. Figure 11.2); 
2 
the monophthongization of /ai/ to /a/ as in the words tie, rice, dime which will sound 
something like tah, rahs, dahm. 
3 
you all or y’all for the second person plural pronoun. 
The monophthongization of /ai/ to /a/ is the ﬁrst stage in the Southern Shift, a series of 
changes in the vowel system. The shift from /ai/ to /a/ has been called the most distinctive 
feature of the Southern U.S. English (Baranowski 2007: 149). The distribution of this shift 
away from the older form /a/ to /ai/ shows distinct patterns. In Charleston, for example, 
Baranowski found that the wealthiest are more likely to use the newer variant /ai/, while

The individual’s understanding of boundaries is something of great interest to 
geographers, who have studied what has been called the maps in the mind. Ayers’ body 
of work conﬁrms that non-Southerners do have a consistent sense of a Southern core, 
which is referred to as the Deep South or Southern Trough.

HILLBILLIES, HICKS, AND SOUTHERN BELLES 
217 
The Southern Trough 
[This] cuts across Mississippi and Alabama, embracing parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, 
and Georgia at the edges. This trough appears to most Americans as the least desirable 
place in the United States to live . . . The whole South appears to be a vast saucer of 
unpleasant associations. 
(Ayers et al. 1996: 69) 
The concept of an undesirable South moves in concentric rings outward from the Southern 
Trough, as seen in a composite “mental map” constructed from a study of environmental 
preferences voiced by students (Gould and White 1992: 97). In Minnesota, the students 
found the most desirable areas of the country to be their own native Minnesota as well as 
California, with other favored points in the Colorado High region. In contrast, they see 
the Southern Trough as the least desirable place to live (Figure 11.3). 
The composite map for the Alabama students looks much like a mirror image of the 
Minnesota map, although the Southerners, too, tend to see California as highly desirable 
(Figure 11.4). 
What a person expects to hear is tied very closely to what he or she expects to experience. 
As a child I never spoke face to face with anyone with a Southern accent. Everything I 
knew about the South I learned by watching Gomer Pyle, Green Acres and The Andy Grifﬁth 
Show. I have a clear memory of my fourth grade teacher telling the class we should not 
watch The Beverley Hillbillies because of the “ungrammatical and ignorant” way of speaking. 
And of course, everybody watched anyway. This means that for me, a Southern accent 
came to symbolize a very limited and peculiar set of characters, which went on until I was 
old enough to read To Kill a Mockingbird and developed a real interest in a culture and 
place so different from urban Chicago. In time I came to understand, slowly, that the

South was a big and complex place, though to this day I sometimes ﬁnd myself reacting 
to certain Southern accents in a negative way, and once again I realize how strong a hold 
the standard language ideology has everyone. 
Large numbers of people growing up in circumstances similar to mine have never had 
any reason to reexamine their preconceptions. Instead the early stereotypes have been 
reinforced by The Dukes of Hazzard County, a general public disdain for things that sound 
Southern, and very speciﬁc criticisms from people in positions of power, some subtle and 
some not so. 
In addition to television comedies, Southern stereotypes originated in syndicated comic 
strips (Kudzu, Lil’ Abner, Gasoline Alley) and ﬁlms (Sweet Home Alabama, Ma and Pa Kettle, 
Forrest Gump, Deliverance). The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture lists a range of stereotypes, 
including sadistic overseers, chivalrous men, good old boys, cheerleaders, beauty pageant 
mothers, Pentecostals, poor white trash and drunken backwoods predators (Wilson and 
Ferris 1989). In this artiﬁcial view of the South, English has an indiscriminate “twang” or 
a “drawl” and is peppered with funny and clever idioms. 
This might be thought of as a North–South mental divide, a here/there that renders 
details of linguistic differentiation unimportant. It is certainly true that by and large, 
outsiders cannot distinguish an Appalachian accent from a Charleston accent, or Texas 
from Virginia. Of course, the reverse is also true: for the most part, Southerners are unable 
to tell one Northern accent from another. 
Sounds like home to me 
How Southerners evaluate themselves and their speech is an important part of understand-
ing the role of language as a marker of regional loyalties, and the resistance to leveling 
across space.

In a survey of 798 adult residents of Georgia, individuals answered questions about what 
it means to “have a Southern accent,” and were subsequently asked to evaluate their own 
language (the results presented as “heavy” Southern or “no” accent as seen in Figure 11.5). 
In any such direct inquiry, some people will underreport their own usage (claim to have 
no accent when in fact they do) and others will claim an accent when they are not local to 
an area and have not successfully acquired a new phonology. Thus this poll is not one 
which can tell us who actually has a Southern accent, or how “heavy” accents really are, 
but it can tell us that people attach bundles of social markers to degrees of Southern accent. 
For that reason, such polls are useful in ways perhaps not anticipated by the persons 
who constructed them. In the selection of questions to be asked, the pollsters reveal much 
of the preconceived notions about connections between certain ways of life and language 
markers embodied in accent. But do these questions comprise a set of sociocultural 
distinctions truly relevant to the construction of definitions of “North” and “South”? 
Between real Southern and half-hearted or make-believe Southern? 
In this questionnaire, most stereotypes about the South are represented one or more 
times. The pollster is looking for Southern/Non-Southern distinctions based on religious 
and cultural practices and beliefs, so that real Southerners – those who will admit to having 
“strong” accents – are the ones who eat chitlins and moon pies, drive an American car to 
church on Sunday mornings while other, less Southern types are at home eating bagels 
and lox. 
Something to note: In comparing the polls in Figures 11.5 and 11.6, it becomes clear 
that perceptions differ very little in matters having to do with stereotype. About 50 percent 
of both groups ﬁnd Gone with the Wind relevant to a deﬁnition of the South (but what if 
they factored race into the analysis? Would the preference hold true?). This is a clear 
demonstration of the strength and durability of stereotypes in deﬁning both self and other.

For the most part, variation in language is active below the level of consciousness. In 
the South, distinctive language features are cultivated by many. The term once used to 
describe such situations is covert prestige as in this example (Riddle 1993): 
Joe is proud of the fact that he has a strong Piedmont accent, even knowing that it 
may well cost him in a job interview. If he tried to sound Yankee, his friends would 
laugh at him. Here the values of home and community are more important than the 
economic or social promises that are attached to “sounding Yankee.” 
Covert and overt prestige are relative concepts and highly dependent on a speaker’s point 
of view. On an internet chat site, when asked what accents he likes and which ones he 
hates, someone like Joe says:4 “There’s an accent from the part of the Piedmont of NC 
where I am from – slow, deliberate, thoughtful and very country. Sounds like home to 
me.” The fact that language variation lies at the heart of much of everyone’s construction 
of the South can be documented in a variety of ways. 
A survey undertaken by the Center for the Study of the American South in 2001 further 
speaks to the fact that Southerners see language distinctions as important. Respondents 
were ﬁrst asked to describe themselves along the familiar parameters (sex, race, age) as 
well as less common ones (church attendance, political leanings, regional allegiances). 
Those who consider themselves Southerners were far more likely to claim a strong or 
noticeable accent (74.8 percent acknowledged an accent of some degree; 25.2 percent 
denied having one at all) (Table 11.2). 
It is hard to imagine constructing a similar survey for Northerners. For such a survey 
to be conducted in Cincinnati, for example, what would be the equivalent of Gone with the 
Wind or moon pies? 
The map in the mind 
In a range of studies focusing on linguistic perceptions, Preston (1989a, 1989b, 1993a, 
1993b; Preston and Long, 1999, and elsewhere) also found that in linguistic terms, non-
Southerners tend to draw rough distinctions between the Southern Trough and the rest 
of the Southern states: Tennessee and Kentucky are the “Outer South;” Texas is its own 
kind of South, whereas Florida is hardly South at all in the minds of most Northerners. 
The “Southwest” may include Texas, but may also exclude New Mexico and Arizona, 
which are often grouped with those states which are perceived as prototypically West.5 
Figure 11.6 shows the results of a Journal-Constitution Southern Life poll in 1995.

In spite of these perceived differentiations, Northerners remain very unaware of what 
distinguishes one Southern variety of English from another, thus producing the one-size-
ﬁts-all accent when attempting to “sound Southern.” 
Students from Hawai’i have a very particular perspective on mainland regional dialects, 
one that casts some light on the schism between mental maps and linguistic evaluation. 
Preston compares a traditional composite construction of Southern (roughly the 
Trough) first to the Hawai’ian perceptual boundary of the South (which adds Texas, 
Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and the Virginias). The students were then asked 
to evaluate tape-recorded samples of speech from a much wider geographical range, 
resulting in the third boundary seen on the map (Figure 11.7). Clearly, what Hawai’ian 
students hear as a Southern accent moves far beyond the boundary of what they identify 
as the South. 
Thus, if we were to isolate those states which seem consistently to be marked as some 
kind of Southern in cultural and linguistic terms (Table 11.2), we are then talking about 
almost 103 million people, or just over 34 percent of the total population of the United 
States in the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century. 
This number might be too small, because it excludes those parts of Missouri, Illinois, 
Indiana and the Southwest where English is perceived as clearly Southern in accent. On 
the other hand, the ﬁgure is clearly too large; to assume that all 103 million people in the 
12 named states are natives and speakers of the indigenous variety of English is a 
generalization that cannot bear close examination. 
Beyond race, there are other dimensions which are not taken into consideration here. 
For example, there are many Native American language communities in the South

estimate to say that somewhere around 30 percent of the population speaks U.S. English 
with an accent which is heard as “Southern.” 
There seems to be a strong urge to synthesize the South into a single population united 
primarily in the fact that it is distinct from the North. This is a process Southerners 
themselves both promote and reject, according to Ayers et al.: 
The South plays a key role in the nation’s self-image: the role of evil tendencies 
overcome, mistakes atoned for, progress yet to be made. Before it can play that role 
effectively, the South has to be set apart as a distinct place that has certain fundamental 
characteristics. As a result, Southern difference is continually being recreated and 
reinforced . . . The South eagerly deﬁnes itself against the North, advertising itself 
as more earthy, more devoted to family values, more spiritual, and then is furious to 
have things turned around, to hear itself called hick, phony, and superstitious. The 
South feeds the sense of difference and then resists the consequences.

One day Ms. Merry Erudite, a client, said to Bob, a senior law partner, “When your 
new attorney speaks, her looks fall off her. In fact, your ﬁrm begins to look shabby 
after she utters a few sentences. Bob, she wouldn’t know an irregular verb if it bit her 
on the elbow. She says, for example, ‘I have went,’ and she doesn’t know she’s made 
a glaring mistake.” 
“I know, but what can we do? She is, after all, a brilliant attorney,” said Bob. 
Merry said, “She also says ‘have ran’ and ‘has broke.’ I suggest that each time one of 
your employees says, ‘I have went,’ you pull out a stun gun, and let ’em have it. Then 
stress proper usage by repeating, ‘I have gone. I had gone. He has gone. They have 
gone.’ Maybe they’ll get the idea and remember to replace went with gone when using 
helping verbs.” 
Dolly Withrow, Charleston Daily Mail, July 27, 2009.6 
Reproduced with permission. 
I start with an excerpt from Withrow’s newspaper column to establish one clear fact: there 
are Southerners who participate – gleefully – in the language-focused subordination not 
just of strangers, but of their neighbors and co-workers. Note that the characters in 
Withrow’s ﬁctional scenario are not poor or uneducated; the person who is getting the 
brunt of the criticism is beautiful and accomplished. 
Perhaps this column was meant to be humorous, but in fact the author has provided an 
excellent example of Bourdieu’s strategies of condescension (Bourdieu and Thompson 
1991: 68–71). Strategies of condescension is a reference to a tactic whereby an empowered 
individual (someone with social legitimacy in terms of employment or education or 
language or other kinds of authority) – appropriates the subordinated language for a short 
period of time in order to exploit it. In this case, the author repeats the verb constructions 
which offend her in order to mock them, and the person who uses them. 
Withrow is a former college professor of English, someone who writes for newspapers 
and has written a book about grammar and usage. Those accomplishments are enough for 
her to claim the advantage over someone she describes as a brilliant lawyer. Withrow 
claims authority in matters of language with some particularly harsh and hostile imagery 
which reduces speakers of the unnamed dialect to creatures in need of violence to be kept 
in line. The strategy of condescension is in fact a part of a larger strategy of subversion, 
or within the framework set up for this study, part of the overall language subordination 
model. 
There are many Southerners who are known to a wider audience: politicians Bill Clinton 
and Al Gore; writers Elmore Leonard, Roy Blount and Dorothy Allison; journalists Katie 
Couric and Kokie Roberts; actors Matthew McConaughey and Channing Tatum. And 
still, the Southerners who seem to come most quickly to the minds of Northerners are the 
ﬁctional ones, and more than that, the stereotypical ﬁctional ones: Gomer, Pa and Ellie 
Mae and the rest of the Beverly Hillbillies, murderous backwoodsmen, vapid beauty 
queens, spoiled young women and wise old ones. 
One of the primary characteristics of the stereotyped Southerner is ignorance, but it is 
a speciﬁc kind of ignorance – one disassociated from education and literacy:

C.  I got an interview with an extremely elite undergraduate college in the Northeast. 
They conducted the ﬁrst substantial part of the interview in [another language] 
and it went well. When they switched to a question in English, my ﬁrst answer 
completely interrupted the interview . . . they broke out laughing for quite a while. 
I asked what was wrong and they said they “never would have expected” me to 
have such an accent. They made a big deal about me having a [prestigious accent 
in the second language] and such a strong Southern accent. Of course, I had been 
aiming for bland Standard American English. After that, I got a number of 
questions about whether I’d “be comfortable” at their institution. Subtle, but to 
me it was not ambiguous.

Together, these comments on the relationship between language, intelligence and 
communication demonstrate the ways in which language barriers are built and rationalized. 
In Example (A), the reporter (notably herself from New Orleans, and the child of life-long 
politicians) projects to her listeners an unwillingness to understand the Southern accent 
in question. Although she is clearly in a position to ascertain Representative Natcher’s 
place of origin, she is content to misrepresent this, lumping all Southerners together into 
a group of drawling and incomprehensible non-conformers who deserve to be pointed 
out and mocked. 
While (A) demonstrates an irritability and condescension which is at odds with jour-
nalistic objectivity, (B) resorts to trivialization and mockery. In a nation-wide broadcast, 
the newscaster uses the ﬁrst person plural, we. This is a coercive gesture, one that forces 
an alliance. 
Example (C) – this one anecdotal – demonstrates Northern discomfort when a link is 
drawn between intellectual authority and the South. A new PhD, a native speaker of 
English, interviews for a faculty position in a foreign language department. He speaks that 
language ﬂuently, and with a prestigious accent. His experience, demeanor and education 
have earned him an interview at an Ivy League school, which goes well. Until the interview 
switches to English. Whatever advantages he brought into the room are forgotten and he 
is summarily rejected. He remains the same person, expressing the same range and quality 
of ideas, but his currency is devalued by language features which link him to the South. 
In (A) the reporter was irritable about the accent which she found out-of-place and 
inappropriate (and hence worthy of rejection); the search committee members in (B) have 
nothing to do with their discomfort but to externalize it as humor. This group behavior 
they ﬁnd socially acceptable, regardless of the way it affected the job candidate.

In (D), the author does not deny that a Southerner has used language in a clear and 
perceptive way. Instead, she speciﬁcally draws attention to the fact that Kuralt’s language 
is not what she expected it to be. Humor, which can be loosely deﬁned in just this way – 
how people react when reality and expectations clash – often focuses on a juxtaposition: 
Gov. Clinton, you attended Oxford University in England and Yale Law School in 
the Ivy League, two of the ﬁnest institutions of learning in the world. So how come 
you still talk like a hillbilly? 
(Mike Royko, “Opinion”, Chicago Tribune, October 11, 1992) 
Federal law requires commercial airliners to carry infants trained to squall at altitudes 
above two hundred feet. This keeps the passengers calm, because they’re all thinking, 
“I wish somebody would stuff a towel into that infant’s mouth,” which prevents them 
from thinking, “I am thirty-ﬁve thousand feet up in the air riding in an extremely 
sophisticated and complex piece of machinery controlled by a person with a Southern 
accent.” 
(The Dave Barry 1995 Calendar, Tuesday, April 4 1995) 
In contrast to the Northern construction of intelligence which is closely linked to a high 
level of education, there is a construction of Southern intelligence that has more to do 
with common sense and life experience. Typiﬁed by the character of Sheriff Andy Taylor 
in the popular television series Mayberry RFD and The Andy Griffith Show, this is the 
Southerner whose intelligence is native rather than acquired. Many plots and comic 
situations in Mayberry depended on the construction of Southern mother-wit and its 
contrast to the less instinctual, acquired Northern intelligence. 
As was the case with Disney animated stories, in this situation comedy Southern accents 
are restricted to those who ﬁt the stereotype: while Andy has a North Carolina accent, his 
son, aunt, and cousins do not. Nor do the philosophizing barber or the mild-mannered 
town accountant, or the teacher (a serious love interest of the main character, and – in line 
with the patterns noted earlier in the Disney ﬁlms – a speaker of *SAE) or the pharmacist. 
The only Southern accents in this rural Southern town are the deceptively clever Andy, 
the dimwitted but good-hearted car mechanics (Gomer and Goober), and the occasional 
rural characters who come into town to make music or straighten out legal problems 
resulting from clan feuds, illegal stills, or excessive violence (Ernest T. Bass). There are 
no regularly appearing African American characters in this particular corner of the South. 
It is primarily on the basis of intellect linked to education that Northerners try hardest 
to convince Southerners that their language is deﬁcient. People with unacceptable accents 
are encouraged to get rid of them by enrolling in a class. The people who show their 
allegiance to home and region by means of language are expected to understand that they 
are subordinate, intellectually and culturally, to their neighbors. The fact that the 
stereotypes which underlie this reasoning are imaginary formations is irrelevant; their 
power is still real, and they are effective. 
As Withrow’s column excerpt at the beginning of this chapter demonstrates, the 
subordination process is most successful when the targets of these efforts become actively 
complicit. 
What is so particularly interesting about subordination tactics in this case is that the 
object of subordination is a whole nation of people, united in terms of history and culture 
rather than in terms of race or ethnicity. It is fairly easy to conceive of the strategies and

----- Page 251 (native) -----
226 
HILLBILLIES, HICKS, AND SOUTHERN BELLES 
processes by which African Americans – 12 percent of the population living in communities 
across the country – are rendered susceptible to language subordination, and come to 
embrace and propagate a language ideology which works to their own disadvantage. But 
the process is a bigger challenge when the targeted group is as large and as internally 
diverse as the Southern U.S. 
Many persons born and raised in the South have no desire to live anywhere else, and 
thus it would seem that threats of exclusion and gatekeeping would be less effective. To 
someone living in the heart of Georgia or North Carolina or Tennessee, the idea that they 
need to acquire an “accentless” variety of Midwestern English to succeed might seem 
ludicrous. Nevertheless, personal anecdotes indicate that Northern bias and standard 
language ideology have an increasingly long reach: 
“It’s ironic,” says [Judith] Ivey [actor], who is from the Lone Star State, “that probably 
the one project that will give me the most exposure [a movie set in the South] . . . is 
one that requires my Texas accent. Particularly since I was told that if I didn’t get rid 
of it, I would have a very limited career.” 
(Liebman 1993:14) 
School ofﬁcial . . . said the [accent reduction] course began when she heard people 
complain that their accents interfered with business. “Instead of listening to what 
you’re saying, they’re passing the phone around the ofﬁce saying, ‘Listen to this little 
honey from South Carolina.’ It’s self-defeating. It’s annoying. It’s humiliating.” 
(Riddle 1993: A5) 
Soon after Atlanta was awarded the 1996 Olympics a year ago, a column appeared in 
the Atlanta Business Chronicle exhorting people to “get the South out of our mouth” 
to impress all the expected visitors. The author . . . a communications consultant from 
New Jersey, wrote: “By cleaning up our speech, maybe we can ﬁnally convince the 
world that we’re not just a bunch of cow-tipping morons down here.” 
(Pearl 1991) 
[A] human resources worker at Southern Bell, [X] is trying her best not to sound like 
a Southern belle . . . she is up for a promotion, and she is worried the decision will be 
made by Northerners . . . She is also taking night speech classes at a community 
college. Unless she can drop the accent, she fears, the promotion committee “might 
not think I’m so sharp.” 
(ibid.) 
In all of these cases, Southerners exhibit insecurity about their language and a willingness 
to accept responsibility for poor communication. In the third case above, the person 
voicing the criticism and calling for acceptance of responsibility and change toward 
Northern norms is, in fact, from New Jersey. But she still claims the right to speak for all 
the people in that region where she lives and works: she wants the world to see her as 
something other than a “cow-tipping moron” in spite of the fact that she lives in the South. 
It is unclear whether she rejects the “cow-tipping moron” stereotype as unfair and 
untrue, or subscribes to it and wishes not to be included in that group. In either case, she 
believes that the way to accomplish such a goal is to convince the rest of the South to talk 
as she does. But here she takes on a Herculean task, for the South provides, more than any 
single ethnic, racial, or national origin group, strong resistance to language subordination.

HILLBILLIES, HICKS, AND SOUTHERN BELLES 
227 
The news media has been shown to be particularly enamored of stories having to do 
with accent reduction, and those reports always include a discussion of such efforts in the 
South. “Hush Mah Mouth! Some in the South Try to Lose the Drawl” (Pearl 1991) is not 
an unusual headline or introductory comment in these kinds of reports. They often contain 
some small commentary from dissenting Southerners: “Somebody was going to judge me 
on the way I spoke, then I would judge him as being close-minded” (ABC Evening News, 
December 15, 1991). 
The news media does not often report on Southern resistance to language sub-
ordination. When doing so, however, journalists still manage to put a decidedly ideological 
spin on the rejection of subordination. In a newspaper report on the death of an accent 
reduction course in South Carolina due to lack of interest, the reporter summarizes various 
reasons why interest might have died out: “With tongue ﬁrmly in cheek, [the instructor] 
offered three possible reasons: Everybody’s cured. Everybody thinks the rest of the world 
talks funny. Or, in a country that now has a Southern President and vice president, maybe 
nobody much cares anymore” (Riddle 1993: A5). 
The tone here is humorous. Clearly it is difﬁcult for those who consider themselves 
*SAE speakers to take seriously the idea that the South could be content with itself in 
terms of language. It is equally difﬁcult to imagine, in spite of professed wishes to this 
effect, that Southerners would somehow magically lose their accents, and could be “cured” 
of this language which is so uniquely their own. 
Another reporter writes of a “Pro-Drawl Movement” in which the resistance is 
trivialized, and once again the strategy of condescension extends to the representation of 
Southern U.S. English in quasi-phonetic terms: 
Ludlow Porch’s radio talk show is at the center of Atlanta’s Southern resistance. Mr. 
Porch, whose voice is as slow and sweet as molasses in January, gets a steady stream 
of female callers who call him “sweet thang” and male callers who call him “mah 
friend.” When complimented, Mr. Porch is apt to say, “Well, ah’m tickled” or “Bless 
your heart.” 
But even Mr. Porch concedes that things are changing. He lives in a suburb where 
he goes for weeks without hearing a Southern accent. And he admits that, sometimes, 
he even catches himself “doin’ silly things – like pronouncin’ mah ‘g’s.” 
(Pearl 1991) 
Filtered through the reporter’s standard language ideology condescension, resistance is 
stripped of much of its power. Here Mr. Porch’s concern about the fate of his culture and 
language are made into humorous objects. He is then made to testify against himself, in 
that he admits that language changes, even as he watches. The journalist’s only conclusion 
can be that language is changing away from Southern norms, and toward Northern ones. 
Thus once again, resistance is demonstrated to be useless. 
When Southern voices are heard uncensored, it almost always appears within Southern 
boundaries, as in this column from the Dallas Morning News: 
The [Southern League] encourages Southerners in the exercise of their indefeasible 
right to be Southern, never mind Northern reproaches and sneers . . . The language 
of the older South is the language of the small towns in which most Southerners grew 
up. Gone with the wind! The culture of the towns, and sometimes the towns 
themselves, have disappeared . . . The old way of speaking has charm and value.

----- Page 253 (native) -----

HILLBILLIES, HICKS, AND SOUTHERN BELLES 
Language is a part of being . . . The more such threads we break heedlessly, the more 
isolated we become in a society seemingly bent on annihilating memory itself. We’re 
not supposed to love the past, we’re supposed to hate it. Modernity drums this 
message into us relentlessly. 
(Murchison 1996) 
There is no doubt that in the delineation of the nation, we use accent as a cultural 
shorthand to talk about bundles of properties which we would rather not mention directly. 
When a Northerner appropriates a pan-Southern accent to make a joke or a point, he or 
she is drawing on a strategy of condescension and trivialization that cues into those 
stereotypes so carefully structured and nurtured: Southerners who do not assimilate to 
Northern norms are backward but friendly, racist but polite, obsessed with the past and 
unenamored of the ﬁner points of higher education. If they are women, they are sweet, 
pretty and not very bright. 
Focusing on language difference allows us to package the South this way, and to escape 
criticism for what would otherwise be seen as narrow-mindedness. Accent makes it possible 
to draw the nation’s attention to the South’s need for redemption without specifically 
raising those topics which make us nervous. If white Southerners are not distinguishable 
by other ethnic markers, by characteristic physical features, or religion, language is one 
simple and effective way of distinguishing between self and other. Because in this case 
differences are historical and cultural, there is less footing for an ideology which sub-
ordinates and trivializes the language and the cultures attached to it. 
Nevertheless, the process continues. Accent reduction courses taught by Northerners 
spring up, ﬁnd some uneasy response in communities with strong Northern ties, and then 
die away. Movies are made in which the lazy and narrow-minded twang and drawl. 
Southern students who come North are taken aside and told that their native language 
phonology will be an impediment to true success. Job applicants are laughed at, and on 
the ﬂoor of Congress, reporters smirk and report not on the Representative’s position, 
but on his or her language. 
The South has resources to call on, ways to deﬂect subordination tactics and it seems 
that at the writing of this book, many Southerners are willing to take a stand: 
Notwithstanding the debate over [the South’s] regional boundaries and the deﬁnition 
of its cultural ethos, it is safe to conclude that no region in the United States has a 
stronger sense of its identity. The increasing commodiﬁcation of things Southern – 
from kudzu to speech – is ample testament of this persistent and intensifying awareness. 
(Wolfram 2003: 124) 
Thus the institutions which are most responsible for the subordination process coax and 
wheedle toward the ultimate goal of cultural and linguistic assimilation, and are met with 
suspicion and deﬁance. 
The seduction of accent reduction 
The news media has topics which seem to be of steady and ongoing interest to them, and 
these are brought to the public’s attention on a regular basis. One such topic is the area 
of accent reduction, or a concentrated effort to take a person who speaks English with a

----- Page 254 (native) -----
HILLBILLIES, HICKS, AND SOUTHERN BELLES 
229 
stigmatized regional, social, or foreign accent, and (supposedly) replace it with one which 
is favored. 
Accent reduction is marketed and sold by individuals who own their own businesses, or 
more rarely, in courses organized by local schools and colleges. College courses to reduce 
accent are found primarily in areas with high levels of immigration. There are also a 
multitude of private coaches who will take on students, but speech or accent reduction 
provided privately is expensive. 
The New York Times ran a news article that reads like an advertisement about an accent 
reduction institute, in which prices were stated plainly: group training, $40 per hour per 
individual; $100 an hour for individual training (not including materials); or the owner 
will instruct privately “at a fee of $150 an hour, or $210 for an hour and a half session, 
plus material and travel time, though most clients visit him” (Luongo 2007). 
There are legitimate reasons to offer this kind of instruction. People who have acquired 
English as a second language and who would simply like to come closer to a native 
pronunciation of U.S. English may want and pursue such training. Actors often need to 
learn how to simulate another accent, in a contrived setting and for short periods of time. 
These are not unreasonable goals, and they are often pursued by well-meaning individuals:7 
It is the position of ASHA [American Speech-Language-Hearing Association] that 
no dialectal variety of English is a disorder or a pathological form of speech or lan-
guage. Each social dialect is adequate as a functional and effective variety of English. 
Each serves a communication function as well as a social solidarity function. It 
maintains the communication network and the social construct of the community of 
speakers who use it. Furthermore, each is a symbolic representation of the historical, 
social and cultural background of the speakers. ASHA also recognizes that standard 
English has been adopted by society as the linguistic archetype used by the govern-
ment, the mass media, business, education, science, and the arts. 
(Prepared statement of Charlena M. Seymour, President, American 
Speech-Language-Hearing Association before the 
Congressional Hearings on Ebonics, January 23, 1997)8 
And yet a large proportion of those advertising accent reduction or elimination draw in 
students with false promises and under false pretenses. 
In any city of average size, there will be a few people who have hung out a shingle and 
sought clients with the claim that they can teach them to lose one accent and acquire 
another. There is no regulation or licensing for such businesses, in the same way that an 
individual can claim to have developed a miracle diet and charge money for it.9 
The providers of these services are often quite willing to take a public stance on issues 
of multilingualism and accent: 
It is absolutely wrong to discriminate on the basis of accent. However, I think this 
country would be much better off if everybody spoke the same language and if 
communication was as clear as possible . . . If we were all clearly communicating – 
this doesn’t mean behaving the same – we’d be much better off as a society. I’m not 
denying heritage, but I think that speech impediments make a person feel bad about 
him or herself. Speech differences [can foster] misinterpretations. Accents divide 
people. 
(New York Newsday, June 29, 1993)

HILLBILLIES, HICKS, AND SOUTHERN BELLES 
When asked by the reporter “Is this another step in the homogenization of America?” an 
accent reduction teacher in New York answers: “I’m not on a search and destroy mission 
to eradicate accents. You know most of the country speaks General American, and we 
want to ﬁt in” (CBS Evening News, October 10, 1984). 
Having asked the difficult question which addresses individual freedoms and the 
relationship of language and accent to identity, the reporter has also solicited the standard 
response, which is quite simply, that homogenization is a good thing. The issue of whether 
or not the goal is realistic or attainable has never been raised, but the ideal – linguistic 
assimilation to *SAE norms – is seen as an appropriate price to pay in order to succeed. 
The media like accent reduction, and they do not seem to distinguish between 
reasonable claims about language and more outrageous ones. In fact, they seem to be so 
clearly enamored of the idea of accent reduction and assimilation to a homogenous *SAE, 
that they are willing to write and broadcast stories about these efforts on a regular basis. 
Disinformation is easily documented across media outlets, and it is the nature of the 
disinformation which is revealing. The story we hear again and again from news media 
representatives is that their own language is the national aesthetic and that those in the 
broadcast media speak a homogeneous English which does not betray (and one notes the 
value-laden nature of that particular lexical choice) their regional origin. In fact, broadcast 
news journalists do speak U.S. English with the same range of social, regional and stylistic 
variation that every other speaker uses. What this means, then, is that not all variation is 
unacceptable or forbidden or stigmatized: it is only those variants associated with groups 
out of favor which must be addressed. Asian, Indian and Middle Eastern accents and 
Spanish accents are not acceptable; apparently French, German, British, Swedish, accents 
are, regardless of the communication difﬁculties those languages may cause in the learning 
and communication of English. 
In New York, the accent reduction teacher tells the reporter that they want “to ﬁt in”; 
but the fact is, those speakers do ﬁt into their settings, in linguistic terms. What she seems 
to be saying is that a language which signals a New York or Puerto Rican origin is a 
liability, whereas one which indicates the Midwest is not. The subtle argument is not for 
overall linguistic assimilation to a perfectly static U.S. English, but to a language which 
is generally Midwest, middle-class, and colorless. 
The individuals who provide us with information and news on a daily basis in print and 
broadcast forums have an unusual amount of power and control in the lives of the public. 
They are given free admittance to our homes, to bring to us their factual knowledge about 
the workings of the world. This process involves choosing among those pieces of infor-
mation to share, and presenting them in a form which is accessible and understandable. 
The translation process from raw material to ﬁnished news report involves ﬁlters of all 
kinds, many of which we are not immediately aware of when we take in the information 
over our dinners. The politics and cultural preconceptions which shape the news and the 
presentation of the news include ideas about language, and the importance of language. 
The process of language standardization is one which is implicitly and explicitly supported 
by the information industry, for practical reasons. In practical terms, it is useful for them 
to have authority in issues of language, which is their primary tool. The assumption of 
this authority happened long ago, but it is necessary in this social contract as in others to 
remind all parties of the terms. Consider the ABC piece on accent reduction designed for 
those who have a Southern accent.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
In this chapter, the popular entertainment examples that contribute to Southern 
stereotypes are dated. You may not know who Lil’ Abner is, and you may never have seen 
an episode of The Beverley Hillbillies. Does this indicate to you a decline in Southern 
stereotypes? If not, where are the current-day stereotypes to be found? How were your 
beliefs and opinions about the South (or the North) formed? If you are interested in 
pursuing this question, you may want to start with Cooke-Jackson and Hansen (2008) 
“Appalachian Culture and Reality TV: The Ethical Dilemma of Stereotyping Others.” 
Read the following article: Knight, D. (2000) Standards. In R. Dal Vera (ed.) Standard 
Speech and Other Contemporary Issues in Professional Voice and Speech Training. 
New York: Applause, pp. 61–78. 
Summarize Knight’s main points and his arguments. Which ones do you ﬁnd credible, 
and why? 
If you are a Southerner, how many different Southern accents do you recognize? Do you 
consider yourself good at telling accents apart? What features do you take note of when 
people talk? Which accents do you dislike, and can you ﬁgure out why, objectively? 
If you know a child of 10 years or so and have that child’s parent’s permission, see if you 
can elicit opinions about the South (or North, depending on where you live) without 
leading. If this isn’t possible, try someone of your grandparent’s generation. Compare 
your ﬁndings in class. 
Without thinking or preparation, write down as many non-ﬁctional Southerners you can 
think of. These can be personal acquaintances or public ﬁgures. When you’re ﬁnished, 
go back and try to be speciﬁc about what part of the South each person comes from. 
Check your answers for accuracy. What results do you draw from this exercise? (If you 
are a Southerner, reverse this process and make a list of Northerners or Westerners.) If 
you are a Southerner, how much do you know about, for example, North Dakota as 
compared to Michigan, or Kansas compared to Idaho? Do you notice any linguistic 
differentiation? Is there differentiation that you just don’t hear? 
Read the entire column by Withrow quoted at the beginning of the section called “Hostility 
with a Southern Accent.” Consider that you have been engaged by the same newspaper 
to write a column that represents a different point of view. In what ways might it be 
possible to approach Withrow to have a calm and rational discussion about the subject 
of grammar? She clearly feels very strongly about this subject, and she will need to be 
approached carefully, with solid arguments. 
A woman writes to Dear Abby to say that she has moved to the Boston area after living 
her whole life in Jackson, Mississippi. It has been two years, but she is still not used to 
people laughing in her face and mocking her accent. She doesn’t understand why people 
ﬁnd this not only acceptable, but amusing. She wants to know how best to respond when 
she comes across this behavior. How do you think Miss Abby will respond, and why? 
In an article called “The Nationalization of a Southernism,” Tillery et al. (2000) present 
evidence that one feature of Southern U.S. English is actually spreading into the North, 
at a good pace. What feature do you think this might be? Read the article and discuss 
how and why this might be happening. If you would like to look at this issue more closely, 
read Hyman (2006).

Notes 
1  In this chapter I am leaving aside African American Vernacular English as it is spoken 
in the South. The similarities and differences between Southern AAVE and Southern 
White Vernacular English (SWVE) are a matter of disagreement among linguists, one 
that cannot be addressed here in sufﬁcient detail. See especially Cukor-Avila (2003) 
for a concise overview of what is called the divergence–convergence debate. 
2  Ayers is a life-long resident of the South and an expert on Southern history. Those 
interested in language variation over space and most especially the concept of the South 
will ﬁnd All over the Map: Rethinking America’s Regions, a book Ayers co-wrote and co-
edited, to be of great use and interest. 
3  Kretzschmar provides a concise but thorough discussion of the technological and 
theoretical challenges of mapping Southern English (Kretzschmar 2003, 2004, 2008a, 
2008b).

5  Similar studies have been conducted in Germany (Dailey-O’Cain 2000); and for Garo, 
a language spoken in rural India and Bangladesh. The willingness of individuals to 
make such judgments is well documented. 
6  An abbreviated biographical sketch of the author from the Hamilton Stone Review, Fall 
2008: 
Dolly Withrow, a retired English professor, taught at West Virginia State 
University for 16 years . . . She is the author of four books, including The 
Conﬁdent Writer, a grammar-based writing textbook for college students 
and writers in general. A columnist for The Charleston Daily Mail and The 
Jackson Herald, Dolly has won national writing awards . . . West Virginia 
Public Radio broadcast her essays for three years. She is a public speaker 
and grammar workshop presenter. 
7  The business of accent reduction is to be kept clearly distinct from speech pathology, 
in which professionals are trained to work with those who have difﬁculty speaking for 
reasons beyond their control. The majority of speech pathologists work, for example, 
with children with cleft palates, stuttering, central auditory processing deficit, 
dysphagia, speech aphasia after a stroke, and other serious conditions.

In a review of the ﬁrst edition of this book, Knight (2000) alternately bashed and then 
reluctantly acknowledged points made in this text and in the writings of other linguists 
about those who sell their services as accent specialists. Speciﬁcally he admitted that 
there is no regulation or licensing for such businesses, but pointed out that neither 
were there such requirements for linguists. 
In fact, every academic linguist attends graduate school, passes masters and/or 
doctoral exams, and defends a theses or dissertation. Any linguist on a college faculty 
has had to apply and compete for that position. In short, academic linguists do not just 
hang up a shingle.

He aha ka hala i kapuhia ai ka leo, i ho’okuli mai ai? 
What was the wrong that silenced the voice? 
Hawai’ian traditional2 
But I can’t talk the way he wants me to. I cannot make it sound his way, unless I’m 
playing pretend-talk haole. I can make my words straight, that’s pretty easy if I 
concentrate real hard. But the sound, the sound from my mouth, if I let it rip right 
out the lips, my words will always come out like home. 
Lois-Ann Yamanaka, Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers (1996: 13) 
Mainland Americans tend to have a romanticized and unrealistic impression of Hawai’i, 
one that goes no farther than images gained from advertisements aimed at tourists: luaus, 
pristine beaches, and an easy-going aloha spirit that makes everyone welcome and 
equal. In fact Hawai’i has the same range of problems found everywhere in the U.S.: 
poverty, racial and ethnic conﬂict and discrimination in the workplace and educational 
system (Southern Poverty Law Center 2010). It also has an indigenous population of native 
Hawai’ians and all the issues that follow from annexation and colonization (McGowan 
1995; Okamura 2008; Takagi 2004; Trask 1992, 1999). 
In Hawai’i, racial, ethnic and socioeconomic conﬂicts are played out – in part – in terms 
of language ideology, at a level of complexity unmatched anywhere in the mainland. 
Matters that would seem uncontroversial to mainlanders are anything but in the Islands. 
Issues of authenticity and authority have everything to do with who may call themselves 
Hawai’ian and who can claim to be Kanaka ‘Oiwi or Kanaka Maoli; that is, native Hawai’ian 
(Pennybacker 1999).3 
The significance of this – and of all the ethnic distinctions that are so carefully 
delineated in Hawai’i – might be best understood by listening to what Hawai’ians say 
about themselves. What follows are anonymous excerpts from discussion boards where 
people who live or have lived in Hawai’i for long periods talk about how they see 
themselves, and about the difficulty of navigating the complex relationships between 
ethnicity, race, class, language and privilege. These excerpts are from exchanges that took 
place on discussion boards in 2004–2005. All punctuation, spelling and capitalization are 
reproduced exactly. Note that Haole is a reference both to pale skin color and origins 
outside of the islands: 
While living in Hawaii, people would regularly ask me “What are you?” and when I 
simply told them “Filipino” that was never enough. I couldn’t be “just” Filipino. Only

when I gave them my complete ethnic breakdown of Filipino, Chinese and Spanish 
was the average local satiated by my answer. So, from my experience, a rigorous 
breakdown of one’s ethnicity is not a matter of trying to fashion an “improvement” 
but rather, that’s the status quo in Hawaii. 
2 
I’m absolutely LOCAL – but I’m not kanaka maoli. I have lived in Hawaii most of my 
life and would NEVER PRESUME to call myself Hawaiian just because I live here. 
That would be incredibly disrespectful to my friends and others who have blood 
quantum (any percentage).

Anyone in California can be a Californian, but there’s a difference between a Hawaiian 
and a Hawaii resident.

I think Hawaii (my home) has way too much Asians to be even called Hawaii now. It 
is a known fact that an estimated 80% of Hawaii’s population are Asians. So the saying 
“Hawaiian land in Filipino hands” should be revised to . . . “Hawaiian land in Asian 
hands.”

I’ve run into a lot of racist people during my life living here. Even though I was born 
here in Kealakekua some people can’t get past that I’m fair-skinned (thanks to being 
50% Norwegian, 25% Finnish, 12.5% German and British) and can’t tan at all. Thus 
when I was younger, and to an extent today, I run into people who treat me poorly 
because I’m haole. 
Hawai’ians talk 
The aboriginal Polynesian language of Hawai’i (‘Olelo Hawai’i) was the only language 
spoken in the islands until they were colonized, when Hawai’i was annexed by the U.S. 
and her government forcibly disbanded. As is usually the case in when a country 
is colonized, ‘Olelo Hawai’i was systematically suppressed and ﬁnally outlawed. It wasn’t 
until 1978 the native language regained its status as one of the ofﬁcial languages of the 
state.4 
Even before colonization, a trade language – a pidgin – took root and then evolved into 
Hawai’i Creole. There is still a good deal of controversy about the nature, origin and 
development of pidgins into creoles, but a few things have been established. First and 
foremost: A pidgin is nobody’s native language. 
Pidgins arise in a restricted social context, where people speaking two or more different 
languages must communicate with each other for short periods of time, in speciﬁc ways. 
The classic example is that of a seaport, where ships from near and far come and go, and 
unloading or loading cargo. For these very speciﬁc and limited situations, communication 
is accomplished by means of a pidgin, a language cobbled together from three or four 
languages in contact. The structure of a pidgin is reduced and simpliﬁed. For example, 
pidgins don’t have subordinate clauses or copulas and they use a reduced pronoun system. 
These kinds of simpliﬁcations are true of pidgins no matter where they arise. 
If the conditions are right, and children are born into a setting where a pidgin is actively 
used, the pidgin may evolve into a creole. The children take in the raw data of the pidgin 
and in the process of language acquisition, they expand it into a fully functioning language 
(Grimes 1994; Grimes 1994; Marlow and Giles 2008; Tamura 2008). 
One way of thinking about this is that a pidgin must acquire native speakers in order 
to become a creole (Nichols 2004; Ohama et al. 2000; Sakoda and Siegel 2003; Siegel 
2008).

Hawai’i Creole (HC) lexical items come primarily – but not exclusively – from English. 
However, the structure of the language draws heavily on Hawai’ian, Portuguese and 
Chinese. Sakoda and Siegel’s Introduction to Hawai’i Creole (2003) provides a concise yet 
thorough overview of the language’s history and structure, along with examples of most 
grammatical strategies. For instance, this example of an infinitive clause structure that 
doesn’t occur in English: 
Hr fo tawk enikine. 
(She’s the kind who’d say anything) 
(ibid.: 101) 
While ‘Olelo Hawai’i was in danger of extinction at several points and its ultimate fate is 
not yet clear, HC is a healthy language spoken by some 600,000 people. Of these, 100,000 
to 200,000 do not speak any other variety of English. This means that of the almost 
1.3 million inhabitants of Hawai’i as of 1990, almost half of the inhabitants speak HC to 
some degree, and somewhere between 10 and 30 percent speak it as a primary language 
(Grimes 1994).5 
Beyond HC, ‘Olelo Hawai’i and English, Hawai’i is as multilingual a place as one could 
find in the United States. There are Hakka, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, 
Ilocano, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Portuguese, Spanish, and Samoan language communities 
which have been ﬂourishing for many generations. There are also populations of more 
recent immigrant workers. 
In Figure 12.1, a pie chart displays the 2009 statistics published by the United States 
Census Bureau about languages other than English spoken at home. On the basis of these 
numbers, one might conclude that HC is a dying or dead language, when exactly the

opposite is true. Figure 12.2 shows the U.S. Census Bureau (2009) ﬁgures for foreign-
born residents of Hawai’i by place of origin. 
As is the case with all creoles, HC exists in various forms along a continuum of most to 
least similar to the base language – in this case, English. On that end of the continuum 
where HC has more in common with English, it is used in a wide variety of public settings; 
Grimes (1994) reports that it is commonly heard in the judicial system and is used there 
by ofﬁcers, jurors, plaintiffs, and defendants, that it is used by some on radio and TV in 
public service announcements, and that there is a “growing body of serious literature, 
including poetry” (ibid.). In its basilectal form (where there is the least mutual intelligibility 
with English), HC is spoken widely by persons of all ages and races, but it is more common 
among the poor and working class, which accounts in part for its stigmatization. This is 
an area where U.S. Census Bureau methodology cannot cope with the complexities of 
language use. This is a larger issue that needs to be addressed, as government funding for 
all kinds of services is dependent on these statistics. 
Marlow and Giles (2008) look closely at the complex interplay of social forces behind 
choices Hawai’ians make between HC and *SAE. They found that all of their subjects 
believed in the primacy of *SAE and its use in business and formal situations. Wording 
used to get this idea across was very similar to that heard from native speakers of AAVE 
when interviewed about parallel language issues (Eades et al. 2006; Ohama et al. 2000; 
Tamura 2002). As is usually the case, the HC speakers are willing to give back the

ideological constructions they have learned which allow them to rationalize rejection of 
the home language: 
M: So, you said that “to get through life” you have to learn Standard English. What 
do you mean by that? 
Ch: Well, like when you go for a job, you cannot talk Pidgin, because they won’t hire 
you. 
(Marlow and Giles 2008: 61) 
At the same time, the subjects declared that they were more comfortable speaking HC, 
and that the language was important to them despite stigmatization: 
I think it’s important for the kids, growing up here in the Islands to learn Pidgin, 
because it’s reminiscent of how it was back in the days of the plantation . . . different 
cultures, different ethnic groups. It’s really important to know that and to embrace 
it because that’s our own culture. That’s the culture of the Islands . . . it allows us to 
remember where we came from and how it got us to where we are today. 
Finally, Marlow and Giles ﬁnd evidence of what anyone would guess on the basis of day-
to-day experience in the world: even in formal situations, sometimes the vernacular is 
called for in order to establish solidarity. 
C: [Pidgin] deﬁnitely helps now, well now with my job. The oddest thing is that I 
can turn it off and on. I can be with a client that is very local and I can ﬂip it in 
a second and just start talking broken English. 
M: So that’s what you do then? 
C: Yes. It really helps me to connect with my clients. 
Hawai’i is also subject to the same social forces that make an L2 accent a handy excuse 
to discriminate. In this case, the discrimination is not so much racial as it is ethnic in 
character. It is impossible to understand the situations considered in Chapter 9 (Kahakua, 
Fragante) outside of this cultural context. 
If you recall, Manuel Fragante sued the Department of Motor Vehicles for language-
focused discrimination in hiring; Fragante is a native of the Philippines, and the DMV 
cited his accent as part of their decision to deny him employment. An important element 
of the Fragante case is the fact that when he applied for the position, his interview was 
conducted by Hawai’ians of Japanese descent. Okamura (2008: 155–186) outlines the 
systematic degradation of Filipinos in Hawai’i throughout the twentieth century, during 
which time Filipino men were seen (and treated) as emotionally volatile, primitive, sexually 
aggressive and violent. This historical animosity is directly relevant to the language-
focused discrimination in Fragante’s case. 
At one time the largest and certainly most established immigrant group, the Japanese 
in Hawai’i had marked advantages in terms of political and cultural clout, all of which 
came to an abrupt end with World War II, when anyone of Japanese heritage suffered 
extreme discrimination. Soon after the war, the Japanese community began to rebuild and 
by the1960s, Japanese political dominance had been ﬁrmly established. Under Haole rule, 
institutional racism had functioned to hold back people of color; under Japanese domi-
nance, other Asians and some Anglos suffered the same disadvantage (Okamura 2008). 
This solidiﬁcation of Japanese political dominance culminated in 1974 with the election 
of George Ariyoshi as governor.6

----- Page 265 (native) -----
240 
DEFYING PARADISE: HAWAI’I 
Under the Ariyoshi administration extreme measures were taken to cement Nisei 
control.7 Laws were introduced which capped immigration; and access to state employ-
ment and welfare were subject to length of residence. Institutionalized exclusion of both 
Haoles and Filipinos was rampant in education especially, where the administration was 
dominated by ethnic Japanese interests. 
As power shifts from one group to another, deep resentments are formed between those 
groups. Filipinos, Japanese, Paciﬁc Islanders, Chinese, Haole, each group has a mindset 
about the others but there is one subject on which all groups seem to agree: HC, and the 
people who speak it (Figure12.3). 
Hawai’ians at school 
In 1987, the Board of Education of the State of Hawai’i made a policy decision they called 
“Standard English and Oral Communication”: 
Standard English [shall] be the mode of oral communication for students and staff in 
the classroom setting and all other school related settings except when the objectives 
cover native Hawai’ian or foreign language instruction and practice. 
(Sato 1991: 653) 
The issue was not whether English should be the language of instruction, or the target of 
language instruction; the Hawai’ian school board takes that as given. The issue is, instead,

DEFYING PARADISE: HAWAI’I 
241 
which language is proper in an educational setting. Not surprisingly, “Standard English” 
is evoked, but not defined. Neither is there any explicit definition of the vernacular 
language that has brought about this policy statement to begin with. Multiple newspaper 
accounts of the controversy which ensued from this proposal did not hesitate to name it: 
Panel wants pidgin kept out of schools 
Panel urges pidgin ban in schools 
Board votes 7–4 to keep pidgin out of classroom8 
Thus this proposal would have had the effect of outlawing HC in the schoolroom. It would 
also have barred the language from playgrounds at recess, gymnasiums during basketball 
practice and cafeterias during lunch. 
The 1987 proposal by the School Board, then, would have taken this well-established 
language spoken natively by more than half a million people and banned it from the school 
system. Why was this language, of all the many languages spoken in Hawai’i, singled out 
for exclusion? While in Arizona legislatures debate bilingual education for native speakers 
of Apache and Spanish, in Hawai’i it occurs to the School Board to ban a language which, 
on one end of the continuum, is mutually intelligible with English. Why? 
During extensive public debate of this issue, a Honolulu newspaper conducted a survey 
of 986 graduating high school seniors on this topic, and that report reveals how socially 
complex HC is, and how closely tied it is to issues of economics and class. Whereas only 
26 percent of the private school students surveyed felt that HC use should be allowed in 
school, 54 percent of the public school students supported its use. Comments ranged from 
“Pidgin English fosters illiteracy,” “Pidgin is a lazy way to talk; it promotes backward 
thinking,” and “Correct English will get you anywhere” to the polar opposites of “Banning 
pidgin would violate our freedom of speech,” “Pidgin is a natural language,” and “It’s our 
way to make Hawai’i different from anywhere else in the United States” (Verploegen, 
June 1, 1988, cited by Sato 1991: 654). 
Hawai’i’s Waianae Coast is the home of the greatest concentration of Kanaka Maoli and 
not coincidentally, of HC speakers; it is also one of the poorest areas, with the largest 
proportion of homeless (Magin 2006). An elementary school teacher who is a native 
speaker of HC further clariﬁes the connection between language, identity, authenticity 
and race: 
What we’re finding is that children who appear to be pidgin speakers to the max, 
meaning it appears they can’t speak anything else, those same children are sitting in 
front of the TV set every night or reading standard English, right? They are 
surrounded by it. These kids are bilingual. We’ll never give pidgin up. We won’t give 
it up because it means something to us. It means we’re not holy, we’re not standard 
English – we are people of color. We won’t give up pidgin because we love it. 
(12 September 1990, Drummond 1990, broadcast). 
By legislating language in the schoolroom – a subject that comes up regularly over the 
years – the School Board hopes also to legislate world view, and a choice for status over 
solidarity. 
Once again it becomes clear that the process of standardization and language sub-
ordination is not so much concerned with an overall homogeneity of language, but with

----- Page 267 (native) -----
242 
DEFYING PARADISE: HAWAI’I 
excluding only those languages linked to the social differences and it is this which make 
us uncomfortable. By the simple expedient of substituting one language for another, we 
hope to neutralize social conﬂicts grounded in race, ethnicity, and economics. If this could 
be achieved, “Nothing then would [be] left but the antipathy of race, and that, too, is 
always softened in the beams of a higher civilization,” hypothesized the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs. While his methods would be seen as unacceptable today, the underlying 
sentiment remains.9 
It is worthwhile to consider the mindset that allowed the question to be raised at all. 
We want the children of the United States to have a thorough command of English, but 
it is more than that. We are not satisﬁed with English as it lives and breathes, English with 
a Cuban accent, the English spoken off the coast of South Carolina, or Hawai’i Creole 
English. We want the right English, the one correct English. In the face of huge amounts 
of factual evidence that a homogenous and monolithic variety of perfect English does not 
and cannot exist, we still pursue this mythical beast as if it were the solution to all of our 
societal ills. One Good English, we feel, is the right of our school children, and the respon-
sibility of their teachers. 
Talk story: “Without Pidgin, I would cease to be whole” 
Wala’au or “talk story” is a phrase which means something like “let’s sit down and talk a 
while” or “to start a conversation” as in the Hawai’i Creole (HC) sentence We go make one 
time fo wala’au den (Why don’t we set a time to talk?).10 The ’Olelo Hawai’i (native 
Hawai’ian) word wala’au is often used interchangeably with HC “talk story” in ways that 
conﬂate the morphology of both languages, as in “Wala’au-ing with the baby” or “She’s 
talkin story with daddy.”11 As a cultural activity, talk story is not restricted to one language 
or language variety and while it is primarily a spoken language act, it is also used in print, 
as in the online ’Olelo Hawai’i newspaper column “Hala’au Sessions with Makela” at Big 
Island Weekly (bigislandweekly.com). 
HC is primarily a spoken language and as such, anyone and everyone local can and does 
“talk story.” Moreover, in language communities such as these where spoken language is 
primary, good storytelling is especially highly valued. 
Broadcast news outlets also know the value of good storytelling, and for many years 
television news programs have used the last few minutes of airtime to present what they 
refer to as human interest stories. These reports often deal with topics which are meant 
to be amusing or inspiring, or have an obvious and unapologetic lesson in citizenship and 
morals. Commentaries on language often come in this packaging. One such report aired 
on July 3, 1983 on ABC under the title “Pidgin language fad is used as defense against 
tourists in Hawaii.”12 This is not a neutral or simply informative news piece; in fact, the 
ABC report employs many of the steps in the language subordination process outlined 
earlier. The title is enough to establish trivialization as the primary subordination tool: 
Hawai’i Creole is a fad, something insubstantial that cannot last for any length of time. 
There is an element of marginalization as well, which portrays Hawai’ians as willfully 
different from, and hostile to, tourists. 
The report is factually wrong even in the essentials, using misinformation to establish 
a tone: “Pidgin is a decades old blend of oriental languages and teen slang.” Not only is 
this statement factually incorrect, it is also phrased to combine mystiﬁcation (“the orient”) 
and marginalization of the non-compliant (“teen slang”). Every element of the story is

----- Page 268 (native) -----
DEFYING PARADISE: HAWAI’I 
243 
designed to reinforce the theme that pidgin is laughable, and pidgin speakers are not to 
be taken seriously. The only uses for HC are trivial, humorous, or, in the case of tourists, 
obstructionist. 
There is more here than blatant mockery. There is a subtle tone in the way the reporter 
talks about speakers of this language, further underscored by inclusion of clearly staged 
conversations. We see three dialogues in HC, each of them between two persons. First 
two men are interviewed while they lie in the sun; we next see two staged dialogues: 
another pair of young men looking into the surf, evaluating the conditions for surﬁng, 
and a young couple arguing in a parking lot. 
Here HC is the language of the young, the unemployed, the over-wrought and emotive, 
the fun-seeking, the beach boy and the teenager: people who are believed to have no 
serious purpose in life. As there are no adults speaking HC, we must assume it is a language 
of youth and will pass with maturity, like pimples or an obsession with loud music. As a 
language which typiﬁes “good grammar gone to grief,” it can have no serious purpose. 
Having established all of this, the report now turns to the popular books which are selling 
well, and which have engendered positive reaction or attention to pidgin from the 
mainstream. There is no way to know if the reporter is unaware of the range and use of 
HC by a large proportion of the Hawai’ian population, from judges to beach boys, around 
dinner tables and in classrooms, or of the fact that it has been carefully studied by linguists. 
Perhaps he is ignorant of these basic facts; perhaps he is purposefully choosing to 
undercount and under-represent the community of HC speakers, not an uncommon 
strategy. The only authority the reporter consults is a non-native HC speaker who is cast 
in a light as frivolous and trivial as the native speakers themselves. 
Such public disavowals and criticisms of HC are not unusual; more than twenty years 
after this report aired, negative commentary still shows up regularly in letters to the editor, 
along with the simmering debate on the role of HC in the schools and classrooms. What 
has changed, however, is the way HC speakers have begun to assert themselves, reclaim 
authority in matters of language use, and publically promote HC as a valid and crucial 
element of Hawai’ian identity. 
Lee Tonouchi – a forceful advocate for HC and its speakers – and someone who 
rejects both speaking and writing *SAE – has promoted the reappropriation of the term 
Oriental. Reappropriation is the process in which a stigmatized language community 
reinterprets a negative label by claiming its use for their own. Examples include the way 
the GLBT community has reclaimed queer and parts of the African American community 
nigger: 
Didn’t used to boddah us, didn’t used to boddah my faddah guys. Lotta people, da 
previous generation, dey all say “Oriental,” dey no say “Asian American,” eh? Just dat 
during our time, dea’s a shift now, try be more PC. So I guess I like rebel against da 
movement on da continent, do our own thing. 
(Honolulu Weekly, November 13, 2002; http://goo.gl/fKNJm) 
In an essay about her documentary “Pidgin: The Voice of Hawai’i”13 producer/director 
Marlene Booth provides a striking example of resistance to the forces of subordination 
and assimilation. The University of Hawai’i requires that all undergraduates pass an oral 
English exam before graduating: “Speech 101, 102, and 103, three semester-long classes, 
were designed to de-Pidginize (my word) the speech of Hawai’i’s university students” 
(ibid.). At least one native HC speaking faculty member teaching these courses ran into

244 
DEFYING PARADISE: HAWAI’I 
problems that the students were willing to talk about, perhaps because she was an HC 
speaker: “they did not want to sound like haoles. Succeeding by taking on the speech and 
mannerisms of Caucasians became too high a price to pay for many students. Talking 
like a haole implied turning your back on family, friends, ethnic group, and neighbor-
hood, moving away from group identity and becoming instead a self-deﬁned individual” 
(ibid.). 
The links that follow provide a wide range of examples in which people talk or write in 
support of HC in direct or indirect ways. Some are in Hawai’ian accented English, some 
in HC.

Notes 
1 In the original language of the islands, the glottal stop (say “uh-oh” and you’ll hear 
your voice stop or “pop” in your laryx) is a meaning-bearing sound which functions 
like a consonant. In writing, the ’okina – much like a backwards single quote – is the 
symbol for the glottal stop. Thus Hawaii is technically a misspelling. To make this 
clearer, a comparison: Ameria is to America as Hawaii is to Hawai’i. More information 
on the sounds and writing system can be found at: http://www.coralreefnetwork. 
com/network/hawaiian.htm. 
2  Hawaiian Dictionary by Mary Kawena Pukui and Samuel H. Elbert. Honolulu: 
University of Hawai’i Press, 1986. 
3 The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1921 contained a controversial deﬁnition 
of “Native Hawai’ians” (Kanaka Maoli) as persons “with at least one-half blood 
quantum of individuals inhabiting the Hawai’ian Islands prior to 1778.” The result is 
a declining number of people who can legally claim Native Hawai’ian status and the 
intensiﬁed peripheralization of Hawai’ians to racial minority status (42 U.S.C. § 3057k: 
US Code – Section 3057K: “Native Hawaiian” deﬁned). The Kanaka Maoli have been 
petitioning the government for the same status as other indigenous Indian nations, 
which would give them a degree of sovereignty. 
4 HC is the only aboriginal language to be thus recognized in the U.S. In 1990, the 
federal government recognized the right of Hawai’i to preserve, use, and support its 
indigenous language. The movement to support and nurture the language is growing 
and seems to be successful. Grimes (1992) reports that there are 2,000 mother tongue 
speakers out of 200,000 to 220,000 ethnic Hawai’ians (20 percent of the population), 
including 8,000 Hawai’ians and 81,000 at least half Hawai’ian. 
5 More current demographic data should be available, given the fact that the U.S. Census 
Bureau gathers information on languages spoken at home in every state. However, the 
Census Bureau does not recognize HC as a real or full language, and so that choice 
was not offered to speakers answering the question “What language do you speak at 
home?” Any HC speaker who felt strongly enough about the importance of HC had 
to ﬁll in the blank marked “other.” 
6 Ariyoshi and his contemporaries are sometimes referred to as the Nisei generation, a 
Japanese language term for the ﬁrst generation of Japanese born outside of Japan to 
Issei (Japanese born). 
7 This is not unique to the Japanese in Hawai’i, of course. Any group coming into 
political power will be concerned with how to keep and bolster that power. The Nisei’s 
ascent is set apart, however, by their internment experiences during WWII, the result 
of “race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.” ((Personal Justice 
Denied: Report of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of 
Civilians, 1982.)

September, 1987, by D. Reyes. 
9 In another state, this one in the Southwest where native speakers of Spanish and a 
number of Native American languages attend schools, a proposal was put forward at 
a State Board of Education meeting in 1987 which echoes in many ways the actions 
of the Hawai’ian school board. In this proposal, a new competency standard was 
proposed which, had it been implemented, would have required that seventh graders 
“speak expressively through appropriate articulation, pronunciation, volume, rate, and 
intonation” before they were promoted to the eighth grade. In this case, the 
professional educators and administers approached the issue by posing a number of

----- Page 271 (native) -----
246 
DEFYING PARADISE: HAWAI’I 
thoughtful questions for themselves, questioning ﬁrst the parameters of what would 
constitute “appropriate” accents: 
Can we establish an acceptable standard for children in all school districts in [the 
state]? 
Can we be assured that Hispanic, Native American, and Asian students will not be 
retained because of what may be considered an “unacceptable” pronunciation? 
What happens to children who do not master this competency? 
When will they receive needed attention to academic skills and conceptual 
development? 
Administrators consulted a range of specialists in language and linguistics as well as 
education, and came to the conclusion that this proposed policy was ill conceived, 
summarizing their position quite simply: Accent is a minimal type of competency in 
relation to conceptual development and language use. “Rather, let us teach children 
to use language to expand intellectual development, to appreciate the richness of 
expression, and enrich lives by knowing what words to choose and use rather than how 
to pronounce them.” 
While this case took a reasonable ending, similar legislation and policies continue 
to be debated in other states. Stalker (1990: 64) reports that in the 1980s, bills requiring 
school systems “to determine which students do not use [*SAE], and to provide 
remedial work for them” were submitted multiple times and rejected each time, but 
only because funding for testing and remedial work was not available.

Immigration is still the greatest form of ﬂattery. 
Jack Paar, comedian. attributed 
Without other, there can be no self. 
Wellman (1993: 244) 
The price of admission 
When fears about the upswing in immigration began to peak in the nineteenth century, the 
metaphor of the melting pot became popular with journalists. Perhaps the idea of a common, 
uniﬁed, united and unvarying American culture sold a lot of magazines; certainly it seems 
that people took comfort in the idea. All the odd, disruptive, unsettling cultures ﬁling through 
Ellis Island and San Francisco would soon be stripped down and remade into something 
American. This is the goal of assimilation, where the less powerful group loses the traits that 
make it different, including its language (Dicker 2008: 53). A comparison of political cartoons 
over space indicates that regardless of the stigmatized immigrant group, whether Irish, 
Guatamalan or Kenyan, the imagery and discourse strategies are remarkably similar. 
Who were these immigrants who held on to their own cultures and languages so 
stubbornly? Figure 13.1 is derived from census ﬁgures for the year 1900, and it indicates 
that the new immigrants – primarily from Italy, Germany, Great Britain, and Scandinavian 
– settled primarily in the cities of the Northeast. More than a hundred years later, many 
still consider this concept of one America – an assimilated Anglo-Saxon America and a 
linguistic Utopia – as possible and desirable. 
In 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau1 estimated that the United States is a nation of some 
310 million people, of whom about 3.2 million are Native American and about half a 
million Hawai’ian. To this number we might add the population we think of as Mexican 
American or Chicano/a, who are descendants of Europeans but also of the aboriginal 
peoples of Central America and the Western U.S. Thus it is an obvious and inescapable 
truth that the majority of people residing in the U.S. are immigrants or the descendants 
of immigrants. Most came of their own free will, while others came in chains. We are a 
nation of immigrants, but having made the transition and established ourselves, there is 
a strong urge to be protective of what is here; we talk at great length about closing the 
door behind us. At times, we have acted on this impulse: 
In the 1840s, during a depression, mobs hostile to immigrant Irish Catholics burned 
down a convent in Boston. 
Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, one of the ﬁrst U.S. immigration 
laws, to exclude all people of Chinese origin.

In 1942, 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent had their homes and other property 
conﬁscated, and were interned in camps until the end of World War II. At the same 
time, many Jews fleeing Nazi Germany during that war were excluded under 
regulations enacted in the 1920s.2 
In 2010, the Governor of Arizona signed a law that, if it is not struck down by higher 
courts, will have institutionalized overtly unconstitutional limitation of the rights of 
Mexican Americans, all in the name of border security. 
With each immigration wave the focus of unease has shifted. Language often becomes the 
focus of debate when these complex issues of nationality, responsibility and privilege are 
raised. English, held up as the symbol of the successfully assimilated immigrant, is 
promoted as the one and the only possible language of a uniﬁed and healthy nation. Using 
rhetoric which is uncomfortably reminiscent of discussions of race in fascist regimes, a 
California Assemblyman notes the multilingual commerce in his home town with 
considerable trepidation: “you can go down and apply for a driver’s license test entirely 
in Chinese. You can apply for welfare today entirely in Spanish. The supremacy of the 
English language is under attack.”3 
In fact, history has established again and again that language cannot be legislated. 
Grammar books may be written and taught, newspaper columnists may rant, but such 
things have no real effect. Figure 13.2 makes it clear just how multilingual a nation the 
U.S. is. 
In considering the history of multilingualism and public fears around it, Heath et al. 
noted that “whenever speakers [of other languages] have been viewed as politically, socially, 
or economically threatening, their language has become a focus for arguments in favor of 
both restrictions of their use and imposition of Standard American English” (1981: 10).

This is illustrated by the history of German use in the U.S., a language (and people) 
which particularly irritated Benjamin Franklin, who expressed his fears in a letter dated 
1753: “Those [Germans] who come hither are generally the most ignorant Stupid Sort of 
their own Nation, and as Ignorance is often attended with Credulity when Knavery would 
mislead it, and with Suspicion with Honesty would set it right” (as cited in Crawford 
1992b: 18–19). 
The relationship between shifting power bases and the public’s awareness of language 
use often focuses on legislation of one type or another, as in this news report on a vote to 
repeal an English-Only law in Florida: 
In reality, Miami has been a bilingual city for a long time. The Miami Herald is printed 
every day in both English and Spanish. Automatic teller machines here offer both 
languages. And whether you’re at the airport . . . or on the streets, you constantly hear 
English and Spanish. But after the Mariel boatlift of 1980 brought thousands of 
Cubans here, voters overwhelmingly passed a law prohibiting the use of any language 
in official county business except English. For example, if you want to testify at a 
commission hearing, question your water bill, or make a formal complaint, it must 
be in English. 
(ABC Evening News, May 14, 1993) 
While most of the public debate around language has to do with a deceptively simple 
question (which language?) the underlying conﬂict is far more complex and interesting. 
When immigrants become bilingual (as happened, for example, in the case of the German 
immigrant population, something that would have irritated Benjamin Franklin, no doubt), 
the question is no longer which language, but which English or more specifically in this 
chapter, which accent and ultimately, which race, ethnicity, religion, worldview.

Who has a foreign accent? 
The Census Bureau estimates that in 2008 there were 37.5 million foreign-born residents 
in the U.S., but signiﬁcantly more – about 54.5 million – who spoke a language other than 
English at home – an increase of a whopping 140.3 percent since 1980.4 This does not 
mean, of course, that all 55.5 million speak English with an L2 accent; in fact, there is no 
reliable way to estimate how many people are vulnerable to this kind of discrimination. 
One thing can be said with certainty: millions of people resident in the U.S. are not 
native speakers of English. Many speak a language other than English in their homes, 
neighborhoods, personal lives and sometimes also in their work. As discussed in Chapter 
2, any individual who takes on the task of learning a second or third language in adulthood 
will have some degree of L2 accent, the degree of which is not readily predictable and will 
not correlate, over all, to education, intelligence or motivation. We do know, however, 
that 62.3 percent of the Spanish-speaking population speak Spanish at home. 
Second, there are preconceived notions about non-native speakers of English which 
have repercussions even to the way we count individuals in their communities and refer 
to them. The U.S. Census Bureau distinguishes between Spanish, Asian, and Other 
Languages, a category that includes all of the continent of Africa (Table 13.1). It is from 
this departure point that we look at the way foreign language groups and the language 
stereotypes associated with those groups are used to classify – and often to dismiss – 
individual rights and freedoms. 
The degree of accent is not necessarily relevant to these behaviors; where no accent exists, 
stereotype and discrimination can sometimes manufacture one in the mind of the listener. 
A high degree of education does not bring with it any protection from discrimination 
based on foreign accent, as was seen in Chapter 9 in the case of Fragante v. City and 
County of Honolulu, and Hou v. Pennsylvania Department of Education. In fact, some 
people are willing to reject foreign accent in a public way when expectations about social 
prominence are affronted and stereotypes confounded. This was the case in a 1987–1988 
search for a president at the University of Michigan, when a Regent told student reporters 
that his institution “would never hire a president with a foreign accent” (Wainess 1994) 
as an explanation of that Regent’s opposition to a particular candidate, a native speaker of 
Greek. The Regent was voicing an illegal intent, but this statement – made public six years 
after the search when the rest of the documentation was released – still passed without 
public commentary. Indeed, this was proof of discrimination but by the time the papers 
were made public, there was nothing to be done about it. 
A person who is a non-native speaker of English may want nothing more than to 
assimilate to the language and culture she sees around her; she may work very hard at it, 
and still sound distinctly like a native speaker of Farsi or Portuguese, simply because 
sincerity and application are not enough to replace one accent with another. Thus hard 
work toward a non-stigmatized variety of U.S. English will not necessarily protect anyone 
from discrimination. This is a lesson hard learned: 
One student in the [accent reduction] class, . . . a 22-year-old from Colombia, feels 
that the course is critical to his future. “To tell you the truth,” he said during a break, 
“this class is my last hope. If it doesn’t work out, I’m going back to my country.” 
The problem, he said, is that he feels that his accent sets him apart from others, even 
though he has lived in this country for nine years. He graduated from Newton High 
School in Queens and is now a junior at Queens College.

“I was practically raised in this country,” he said, speaking in a soft lilting accent. “But 
I have this accent. Does that mean I’m not an American? I don’t know.” 
(Hernandez 1993) 
It is crucial to remember that it is not all foreign accents, but only accent linked to skin 
that isn’t white, or which signals a third-world homeland, which evokes such negative 
reactions. There are no documented cases of native speakers of Swedish or Dutch or Gaelic 
being turned away from jobs because of communicative difﬁculties, although these adult 
speakers face the same challenge as native speakers of Spanish, Rumanian, Thai or Urdu. 
Immigrants from the British Isles who speak varieties of English which cause signiﬁcant 
communication challenges are not stigmatized: the differences are noted with great 
interest, and sometimes with laughter. A student asks to speak to a professor after class. 
“Fine,” says the native of Scotland, a long-time resident of Ireland and England. “You can 
call tomorrow afternoon.” The student is perplexed: having asked to see this professor, 
she is told to telephone. When the confusion is cleared up (in the Professor’s variety of 
English “to call” means “to stop by”), they laugh about it. Another professor, a native of 
India and a bilingual, life-long speaker of English, is met with a colder reception when 
similar difﬁculties arise. 
“Better get rid of your accent,” sings an angry Puerto Rican youth in response to more 
hopeful dreams of a better life outside the ﬁctional barrio of West Side Story. 
There are many people who must cope, day by day, with the fact that the way they speak 
English is not acceptable. Some of them have other currencies – political and economic 
power, social pre-eminence, artistic excellence, other public achievements – with which 
to offset the disadvantages an accent brings with it and to disarm the prejudiced listener. 
In face-to-face conversation, most listeners, no matter how overtly negative and hostile, 
would be hard pressed to turn away and ignore Arnold Schwarzenegger (Austria), Penélope 
Cruz Sánchez (Spain), Christiane Amanpour (Iran), Gabriel García Márquez (Columbia), 
Arianna Huffington (Greece), Zbigniew Brzezinski (Poland), Nelson Mandela (South 
Africa), or Ang Lee (China). 
But most do not have these resources. People have always come to the United States 
because in the imagination of the world, it is a place of real opportunity. The costs of 
democracy, of assimilation, are not spelled out in the papers they must ﬁle to live here, 
but in the stories of people like Henry Park. The narrator of the novel Native Speaker 
draws a vivid picture of himself and all immigrants: “They speak . . . not simply in new 
accents or notes but in the ancient untold music of a newcomer’s heart, sonorous with 
longing and hope.” 
What the newcomer must learn for him or herself is the grim reality of limitations 
imposed by a standard language ideology. For most this will not be a surprise; we are not 
the only nation that promotes the idea of a standard, homogeneous language. 
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
What is the connection between nationalism and language? 
The United States is not the only country which subscribes to a standard language 
ideology. How (if at all) would somebody studying Greek come to know and understand 
the sociolinguistic clues embedded in Greek?

After six years of learning a foreign language exclusively in a classroom, what can the 
average student not know? 
Find a native speaker of a language other than English, someone who is willing to talk to 
you. Using the following examples, ask your informant these questions: 
I understand you grew up in Italy. Where exactly? 
How many native languages are there in Italy? 
Where in Italy is the best (standard) Italian spoken? The worst? 
What do you like or dislike about the best variety of Italian? The worst? 
Did your own Italian accent cause you any discomfort when you were there? Did it 
provide you with any advantages? 
Report to the class on what you learned about the culture and language ideology of the 
country in question. 
Most Americans feel they know the basics about England. In class, discuss what you 
know about the use of English in Great Britain. Do you know where people believe the 
best English is spoken, or by whom? Which regional or social varieties of English are 
most likely to be made fun of? 
In so far as possible, repeat the third exercise with persons who are natives of Great 
Britain. Try to ﬁnd a range of people from different parts of England, Wales or Scotland. 
In class, discuss how close (or far away) the class was in the estimation of prestigious 
and stigmatized varieties of British English.

The term Hispanic, coined by technomarketing experts and by the designers of 
political campaigns, homogenizes our cultural diversity (Chicanos, Cubans, and 
Puerto Ricans become indistinguishable), avoids our indigenous cultural heritage and 
links us directly with Spain. Worse yet, it possesses connotations of upward mobility 
and political obedience.

9.7 million Latino/a citizens reported voting in the 2008 presidential election. This 
was an increase of 47 percent from 2004. 
Voting and Registration in the Election of 2008, http://goo.gl/5cJPN 
Counting in Spanish 
The U.S. Census Bureau reported an approximate 48.4 million persons of Latino/a origin 
in 2009, about 15.5 percent of the current total population. Figure 14.1 provides a view 
of immigration over time. On this basis it is quite easy to see how it is that the Census 
Bureau projects that people of Latino ancestry will make up almost 25 percent of the 
nation’s population in 2050.1 
The government uses “Hispanic” as an umbrella term for everyone who is of Spanish-
speaking national or ethnic origins. Figure 14.1 draws attention to how broad this category 
is, how many different national identities, world views and cultures are subsumed into the 
idea of Hispanic. 
Diversity over space2 
One indication that Latinos/as retain strong ties to homeland and heritage can be seen in 
settlement patterns (Figure 14.2). For example, large-scale immigration from Cuba began 
with Castro’s rise to power in 1959. Those immigrants formed communities in Southern 
Florida (such as “Little Havana” in Miami) and the metropolitan New York area. Cubans 
– especially those who feel strongly about returning to the homeland and regaining 
political power – maintain strong ties to Cuba, its culture, and to each other. There are 
neighborhoods in the cities and towns of Southern Florida where Spanish is the dominant 
– and sometimes the only – language (Figure 14.3). 
On the West Coast, Spanish-speaking (largely Mestizo) communities were well 
established when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in 1848, formally trans-
ferring much of the West and Southwest territory from Mexico to the U.S. The treaty 
had many provisions that were meant to protect Mexicans’ rights, most of which were

broken. Many historians see the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as the beginning of 
systematic racism and discrimination toward Mexicans and Spanish speakers more 
generally. The many bicultural and Spanish dominant communities along the border can 
document a long history of discrimination in every aspect of daily life. The Chicano 
movement of the 1960s and 1970s was an organized, large-scale effort to address such 
inequalities (Figure 14.4). 
Currently the term Chicano is generally understood to be reserved for those of Mexican 
origin who were born and raised in the U.S., but who do not identify themselves in the 
ﬁrst line as Americans. According to Rubén Salazar, “A Chicano is a Mexican-American 
with a non-Anglo image of himself” (June 2, 1970).3 More recently Gustavo Arellano, 
author of the popular and often controversial Ask a Mexican! newspaper column for 
California’s Orange County Weekly has written at length about intercultural tensions

between well-established Chicanos and those newly arrived from rural Mexico. Chicanos 
may refer to such Mexicans as Chúntaro, while the newly arrived use the term Pocho (rather 
than Chicano) for an Americanized Mexican (Arellano 2007). 
The history of Puerto Ricans in the U.S. is very different. With the Jones–Shafroth Act 
of 1917, Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship,4 so that there is no discussion of

immigration quotas, work visas or resident status. Puerto Ricans have no need for visas, 
but they have been the focus of discrimination for a long time in the Northeast. This is 
probably due, at least in part, to the strong ties between Stateside Puerto Ricans and Puerto 
Rico and the fact that many of the communities in the U.S. prefer their own culture and 
language to assimilation. The largest wave of Puerto Rican immigrants (often referred to 
as “the Great Migration”) began with the Depression and lasted through World War II and 
into the 1950s. Puerto Rican communities settled in East Harlem, on the Lower East Side, 
Upper West Side, in Chelsea, and Hell’s Kitchen, as well as in Brooklyn and the Bronx. 
Despite differences in their history and culture Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and Cubans 
have all been identiﬁed by the U.S. Census Bureau as Hispanic. What unites them and the 
other countries in that group is a strong allegiance to the homeland and family, a common 
religion (primarily Roman Catholic) and an inclination to hold onto Spanish as a primary 
language.5 Oboler’s work with Spanish-speaking immigrants from nine countries (all ages, 
both genders) employed as garment workers in New York also establishes the importance 
of solidarity within national origin groups (the wish to be identiﬁed as Cuban or Puerto 
Rican or Dominican), while at the same time, workers take pride in the commonality of 
language (Oboler 1995, 2006). Others have made similar observations: 
Latinos in the United States predominately self-identify as “Hispanic” and/or “Latino” 
in addition to their national origin, but they do not self-identify as “American.” 
Undergoing a process of “racialized assimilation,” Latinos are not viewed by other 
U.S. citizens as “unhyphenated Americans” but as, speciﬁcally, “Latino and Latina 
Americans.”

¡YA BASTA! 
There is a twist to this discussion of labels, however, and it is an instructive one. In 1970, 
the U.S. Census Bureau wanted to develop better methods to identify Spanish-speaking 
people before the next (1980) census. The 19 committee members were predominantly 
of Mexican ancestry and included the leaders of civil rights organizations. It was this group 
that recommended use of the term Hispanic as one that would embrace all persons of Latin 
American origin (Gómez 2007: 150–151). Today the term is contested for a variety of 
reasons, but the Census Bureau shows no interest in re-evaluating its usefulness. 
Zentella (1996) provides another perspective on the matter of labels imposed on 
peripheralized populations. She speaks and writes of what it was like for her as a child to 
have had a singing and dancing Chiquita Banana as a solitary Latina ﬁgure in the public 
eye. She uses the term chiquitafication to describe public policies and practices which 
homogenize Latino/a cultures and languages into a tidy and digestible package for the rest 
of the nation, identifying three speciﬁc misconceptions arising from this practice: (1) the 
idea of a homogeneous “Hispanic community” that refuses to learn English; (2) the 
belittling of non-Castilian varieties of Spanish; and (3) the labeling of second-generation 
bilinguals as semi- or alinguals (ibid.: 1). 
As seen in Figure 14.5, the individual’s allegiance to national origin patterns quite 
strongly to that person’s language preference. That is, a person who speaks primarily 
Spanish is far more likely to name a specific national origin, such as “Mexican” or 
“Guatemalan” or “Peruvian” rather than the less speciﬁc Latino/a or Hispanic. The group 
that is most likely to self-identify as American is composed of those who report that they 
speak primarily English. 
There is reason to be wary about attempts to demonize immigrant populations. John 
Tanton, the founder of many different extreme anti-immigration groups and periodicals, 
has been vocal about his belief that Mexican immigrants pose a real threat to Americans: 
Tanton has warned of a coming “Latin onslaught” and proposed that high Latino birth 
rates would lead “the present majority to hand over its political power to a group that is

simply more fertile.” Tanton repeatedly demeaned Latinos in the memos, asking whether 
they would “bring with them the tradition of the mordida [bribe], the lack of involvement 
in public affairs” and also questioning Latinos’ “educability” (Beirich 2009). 
In their study of the representation of Latino/as in the media, Penﬁeld and Ornstein-
Galicia (1985) note general trends: Latino/as are almost always portrayed as violent and 
with explosive tempers; Chicanos/as in California’s large cities are drug-pushers, gang-
members, pimps. In rural areas they are migrant farm workers. Just as Disney never 
thought to give the character of a carpenter (or a ﬁre ﬁghter, or a street sweeper) a French 
accent, ﬁlm makers ﬁnd it difﬁcult to imagine Latinos/as as accountants, copy shop owners, 
engineers or veterinarians. 
The Spanish universe 
Some Latinos live in communities of monolingual English speakers, where a Spanish 
accent stands out. Others live in communities where multiple varieties of English co-exist 
in relative harmony, in which Spanish, English, and Chicano or other varieties of Latino 
English each have a place. Chicano English, Puerto Rican English and Cuban English 
in Los Angeles, New York and Miami are distinct from each other, with distinctive 
syntactical, morphological and discourse markers (Jenkins 2009; Villa and Rivera-Mills 
2009, García and Otheguy 1988; Penfield and Ornstein-Galicia 1985; Valdés 1988; 
Zentella 1988). 
When Zentella protests the labeling of second-generation Spanish-language immigrants 
as semi-lingual or alingual, she is referring to code switching, the orderly (grammatically 
structured) alternation between two or more languages, a subject of great interest to 
linguists and one which is widely studied.6 This complicates the picture of the Spanish-
speaking universe considerably. We have distinct languages, each with its own stylistic 
repertoires: Spanish and English. To these we add more recently developed but distinct 
varieties of English, for example, Chicano English and Chicano Spanish as they are spoken 
in the Southwest and West. Now we have also the phenomenon of living and working 
with three languages, and switching among them as determined by language-internal 
(syntactical and morphological) rules as well as social ones. In comparison, style switching 
may seem to an unsympathetic outsider nothing more than a language hodge-podge, one 
often labeled Spanglish. 
I would argue that whether the object of subordination is the act of style switching, or 
pressure to use one speciﬁc language rather than another, the ultimate goal remains the 
same: to devalue and suppress everything Spanish. To call code-switching Spanglish in a 
dismissive way is just another subordination method with a long history: to deny a language 
and its people a distinct name is to refuse to acknowledge them. There is a shorthand at 
work here, and that is, there is only one acceptable choice: it is not enough for 44 million 
Spanish speakers to become bilingual: they must learn the right English – and following 
from that, the right U.S. culture, into which they must assimilate completely. Certainly 
Spanish speakers feel that discrimination toward them has more to do with language than 
with immigration status, skin color or economics (Figure 14.6). 
On rare occasion, there will be public commentary which makes clear that the offer we 
make to immigrants is contingent on a certain kind of English, as in this radio broadcast 
(May 23, 1994) which begins with images of confusion and bloodshed in a multiethnic 
urban setting:

Los Angles has cosmopolitan eyes and ears. We know a Korean billboard from a 
Chinese one even though we may not read either language. Those bloody names that 
spill out of the television every night – Gorazde, San Cristobal. They don’t sound so 
foreign here as they might in the Dakotas. So, why are we frustrated at the sound of 
our own voices? 
Note the blunt tactic of a straightforward demand for cooperation: We are frustrated by 
ourselves, by the multilingualism of Los Angeles. By coercing participation in this way, the 
commentator makes his frustration everyone’s frustration. Thus, a great deal of latitude 
can be assumed in matters where he might not otherwise feel entitled to impose his 
opinion: 
It’s because over the counters in our banks, over the tables in our restaurants, and 
over the phones in our ofﬁces, in job interviews and in meeting rooms, Los Angeles 
speaks not just with dozens of foreign languages, but with dozens of variations of 
English, not to mention our own native accent, from Ice-T to Beverly Hills 90210. 
It’s all English, we’re all speaking the same language, but that doesn’t mean we’re 
communicating. How do you bring up something that’s more personal than bad 
breath and more embarrassing than an unzipped ﬂy? How do you tell people who are 
speaking English that it’s a kind of English we can’t understand? Mostly we don’t 
even try. We say, “Thank you,” and then we hang up the phone and call back a few 
minutes later, hoping that someone else will answer. 
(ibid.) 
Morrison ﬁrst assumes that all immigrants want to be bilingual, but then shifts the focus 
of outrage from no English to the wrong (accented) English, or English that literally stinks

263 
of unwashed humanity. There are no excuses made for rejecting the communicative 
burden; it is acceptable just to “hang up the phone.” He moves on to make some con-
cessions: accent is immutable past a certain age, even when people would like to acquire 
a perfect English. 
The newcomers want to learn English . . . The cruelest thing about this is that 
learning the words is the easy part; learning the accent may never happen. An expert 
in these things says that after puberty, muscles that have formed one language for 
years just can’t change very easily to a new one. 
Finally, we come to the heart of the matter. Certain accents are frustrating and disturbing 
and worthy of reduction (he has already admitted that accent elimination is an impos-
sibility). He wants to reduce these accents, but there’s a complication: in so doing he is 
making a negative statement about the social identities to which they are attached. 
In order to soften this blow and render accent reduction more palatable, Morrison 
employs another tactic: the concern with fairness is labeled “politically correct,” a neat 
and very quick way to render an idea trivial, petty and worthy of rejection. I know that this 
is wrong on some level, the commentator is saying, but it is done so much – why ﬁght it?7 
The changing colors of Mexico 
Before looking more closely at language-focused discrimination in the Southwest, it is 
important to consider how issues of race, ethnicity and language work together. 
From the time of the ﬁrst U.S. Census in 1790 to the 1850 Census, there were only two 
possible choices for race: white or black. After 1850 the Census Bureau started experi-
menting with different levels of classiﬁcation, and included categories such as Mulatto and 
Amerindians. In 1930, for the ﬁrst and last time, the Census Bureau included Mexican as 
a race. The protests of the Latino community were organized and persistent, with the 
result that in 1940 this practice was stopped (Gross 2007; Leeman 2004). The term Mestizo 
would likely have been acceptable to Mexican-Americans, but the Census Bureau chose 
not to pursue that possibility, and in 2010 that is still the case. 
Mestizo is a category ofﬁcially recognized in most of Central and South America as a 
reference to persons of mixed ancestry, descended from both the indigenous peoples of the 
southwestern U.S., Mexico and Central America, and the Europeans who colonized them. 
There are many communities of indigenous peoples in Mexico, but some large portion of 
the rest of the population could be seen as Mestizo. Miguel Barriento, an advocate for the 
Mestizo community in Nevada, summarized the situation: “We are not White. We are not 
Black. We are a mix of White and Indian, which is Mestizo” (March 23, 2010). 
Latino/as may be any race, but “the general image of Latinos is that of the Mestizo. In 
other words, the supposed ‘Latin look’ is that of the Mestizo” (Baker 2009). Baker makes 
this point in support of the drive to add Mestizo to the choices for race offered by the 
Census. He also notes that because the Mestizo population outnumbers the Afro-Latin 
and other Spanish-speaking populations, the contributions of those groups are minimized 
as a result: 
[B]aseball star David “Big Papi” Ortiz (black) does not physically look like actress 
Cameron Diaz (white), and that soccer legend Pele (black) looks nothing like

¡YA BASTA! 
funnyman George Lopez (Indio/Native American), and so on. Yet, they are all Latinos 
here in the U.S. 
(ibid.) 
While social scientists and politicians debate this issue of race, the public has come to its 
own conclusions. Anglos do see Mexicans as racially other: not white or black, but brown. 
Barrett (2006) took a job as wait staff at an Anglo-owned Mexican restaurant in California 
to study Anglo/Mexican language ideologies in a realistic, unarranged setting. The 
casualness with which staff and managers acknowledged the color line (wait staff is Anglo; 
kitchen staff is Latino) is seen in this example of an exchange between Barrett and a 
manager: 
Manager: Oh, your check isn’t in this pile, this is the brown pile. 
Me: They’re divided that way? 
Manager: Well, you know, kitchen and wait staff. 
(Barrett 2006: 176) 
A comparison of the official stance (Mexicans are white, according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau) and the reality documented by Barrett and many others (Cobas and Feagin 2008; 
Gómez 2007; Hill 2008; Niemann et al. 1999; Rinderle and Montoya 2008; Santa Ana 
2002, among others) suggests that Mexican-Americans occupy an ambiguous position in 
the social order that has rendered them off-white (Gómez 2007).8 This is what Foley (1998) 
calls, quite aptly, “a parallel universe of whiteness” (as cited in Powers 2008: 62). 
The relevance of these complex issues of race will become clearer in the following 
sections on speciﬁc kinds of discrimination. 
We’re not going anywhere: performing race 
In teaching an annual course on language and discrimination, I found that arguments 
rarely escalated past the usual soft-voiced and apologetic differences of opinion. One 
exception came during a class discussion on English-Only. A Mexicana student raised the 
subject of the growing Latino population in California and what that meant to a majority-
rule-based electoral system and language rights. The tension in the room was immediate. 
Another student said to her, quite defensively, “WE settled California” to which she 
responded with a short, concise history of Spanish settlements in the Southwest that 
predated Anglo settlements by a good margin. There was an awkward silence. 
Then the other student said, “We’re still the majority.” 
To which she said, “We were there first, and we’re still there and we’re not going 
anywhere.” She might have added, and it won’t be so long before we’re the majority, bucko, but 
she withheld, quite sensibly, that obvious fact. 
Another student, quiet until that point, raised the question of individual liberties, the 
Bill of Rights, and language, and the conversation veered away. It is my practice to allow 
such conversations to run their natural course without interruption or manipulation, 
though in this case I was sorry the discussion ended so quickly 
This kind of exchange repeats itself daily, in all kinds of communication acts in every 
possible setting and tone. One way to look at such interactions is by means of performance 
theory.

----- Page 290 (native) -----
¡YA BASTA! 
265 
Human beings are by nature performers; we project our identities again and again to 
ourselves and everyone else, in an act that that provides a kind of psychological cultural 
grounding. In our everyday lives we “simultaneously recognize, substantiate, and (re)create 
ourselves as well as Others through performance . . . performance becomes a ubiquitous 
force in our social and discursive universe” (Madison 2005: 73–74). 
In a classroom where societal racism is discussed and confronted, the performance of 
race and ethnicity can become emotionally extreme. In such situations there is more than 
factual knowledge at stake, there is also the individual’s sense and understanding of self. 
The exchange in my classroom was immediately fraught, because by asserting herself, the 
Mexicana student was challenging the conventionally taught history of the United States, 
among other things. At that, some or all of the Anglo students felt the need to reassert 
their own identities, preferring their own narratives to hers. 
There are commonalities in such situations that have been widely studied. In this kind 
of classroom situation: 
[Anglo student responses] range from overt racism, to entrenchment in white 
supremacy, to refusing to listen to others, to actively denying the importance of racism 
and student complicity in it. Furthermore, students typically present themselves as 
moral and responsible social actors who would rather not be identiﬁed as racist and 
subsequently attempt to persuade others that they support equality and justice. 
(Johnson et al. 2008: 114) 
The discussion in my classroom was an excellent example of how individuals perform race 
and ethnicity. That is, the Mexicana student presented or performed herself to herself and 
to the class as a conﬁdent, knowledgeable, assured woman of color who knew exactly where 
the ﬂaws in the other student’s arguments were. She would not be intimidated. The student 
who challenged her responded by performing whiteness. Johnson et al. provide another 
example, from their own work with college students in Southern California. From a 
student essay: 
I am “white,” but at my high school “white” people were the minority. Quite fre-
quently I would be walking in the halls, unable to understand anything being said 
around me. At one of my jobs, my co-workers would talk about me and my friends, 
right in front of our face, in a different language. 
(ibid.: 126) 
There is a structured racism here that is so deeply embedded that it becomes normative 
and invisible to the privileged. The student is sharing information about an experience he 
or she found hurtful and unsettling. On the surface many reading her short statement will 
nod in agreement, thinking yes, it is rude for people to speak Spanish in front of me, as I can’t 
understand them. One way to challenge this mindset is to ask a simple question: Is it equally 
rude to speak English in front of a Spanish speaker with limited or no English skills? 
The answer to that question gets to the heart of the matter: as an English speaker, the 
student who complained about being excluded believed she or he was reasonable in 
expecting everyone to accommodate to her/him. 
It can certainly feel uncomfortable to not understand languages being spoken in one’s 
presence, and yet: “Discomfort is not oppression. It is a sign of privilege when white students 
believe they should be able to understand everything going on around them or never have 
their racial embodiment questioned publicly” (ibid.: 126–127; emphasis added).

----- Page 291 (native) -----
266 
¡YA BASTA! 
This mindset is at the very heart of long-standing conflicts between the U.S. and 
Mexico. Our common history is very old and checkered, and most of it is unknown to 
those people who are most adamant about halting immigration from Mexico. This might 
be seen as a failure of our education system, but that kind of policy is not made in a vacuum; 
the impetus was born out of a communal agreement that may have been founded in apathy 
or jingoism. Grand narratives (also called meta narratives) may be ﬂawed, but many feel 
a strong allegiance to the stories which provide a comforting cultural buffer zone. 
The everyday language of white racism9 
The importance of language to identity and to ethnicity has been well established by 
sociolinguists and anthropological linguists. For people of Mexican heritage living in 
California, there is a lot of data to suggest that for these Latinos/as, language is perhaps 
the primary marker of allegiance (Arellano 2007; Fought 2002a; Gómez 2007; Hidalgo 
1986; Mendoza-Denton 1999; 2008; Salazar 1970; Santa Ana 1993). 
In studying the connection between language and ethnicity, Fought interviewed 
adolescent Latinos/as to explore how language choices reﬂect life choices (Fought 2002a, 
2006). The relationship between language choice and assimilation/solidarity may seem 
like simple common sense, but as we have seen, many common-sense beliefs about 
language are not factual. In this case, the use of language features to signal solidarity with 
one community over another was only theory until Labov’s groundbreaking work on the 
island of Martha’s Vineyard off the coast of Massachusetts. Using quantitative methods 
and statistical analysis, he examined the diphthong /ai/ and found that the ﬁrst element 
was raised in the speech of ﬁsherman and others who showed a dislike of or resistance to 
the many summer visitors to the island, and a high degree of pride in local heritage. 
In the course of his ﬁeldwork he also established that adolescents who intended to move 
off the island as adults and live on the mainland began to give up local language markers 
well before that day came, while those who intended to stay and take up traditional 
employment were far more likely to retain local language markers such as the raised ﬁrst 
vowel in /ai/. 
It is this kind of pattern that Fought found among Chicanos/as in California. People 
who grew up speaking Spanish and who speak it ﬂuently sometimes choose not to speak 
it at all; at the other extreme are those who never learned Spanish and who see this as a 
lack in themselves, because it is seen that way by the rest of their community or peer group. 
Consider Fought’s interview with Veronica, a 17-year-old from Los Angeles who 
identiﬁes herself as Mexican, but (as she relates) is then corrected by other Chicanos/as. She 
is told that she can’t be Mexican, because she doesn’t speak Spanish. In a similar way, another 
student, Amanda, is often told that she’s a disgrace because she doesn’t speak Spanish at all, 
a statement that will be delivered with differing degrees of disapproval (Fought 2002b: 201).10 
The link between nation and language is so strong that the terms for the two are often 
used interchangeably. For example, it is not uncommon to hear one person ask another, 
“Do you speak American?” Mexican and Spanish are also used interchangeably: 
CF: Even if they’re Mexicans, some people don’t speak Spanish. 
E: No! Some people are like that. I hate people like that, that are Mexican, and they 
try to act like if they don’t know Mexican. So – but some of my friends that are 
Mexican, and – they don’t know how to speak Mexican. 
(ibid.: 202)

----- Page 292 (native) -----
¡YA BASTA! 
267 
Another example from a study conducted in Texas by Achugar and Pessoa indicates that 
this mindset is not exclusive to California: 
[T]here you know I have met some Chicanos here that don’t speak any Spanish but 
that seems to be because their parents came from some other part of the country 
where they try to be white or something and so they don’t speak any Spanish, but 
hopefully . . . I’ve met some white people that have lived here all their life and they 
don’t know any Spanish, like none. And I’m like, “How can you not know any?”, I 
mean, don’t you hear people talking ever? Like, I don’t understand that. So, yeah, 
they just must be very, like, secluded, like all their friends are white. 
(Tania, English-dominant, cited in Achugar and Pessoa 2009) 
For the rest of this chapter the discussion will focus primarily on the experiences of 
Mexicans, Mexican Americans, Chicanos/as and Latinos/as in the Southwest. It is impor-
tant to note that there are large populations of Cubans, Salvadorans and other Spanish-
speaking individuals in Southern California; however, the nature of the data does not allow 
me to separate these groups when discussing, for example, housing discrimination.

Texas, 2009: Over at least a three-year period police ofﬁcers wrote citations for “non-
English-speaking driver,” a law that does not exist. In every case the person ticketed 
was a native speaker of Spanish. As soon as this practice came to light, the police 
department began an investigation of all involved ofﬁcers for dereliction of duty. Fines 
collected from drivers ($209 each) were refunded and charges dropped. A repre-
sentative of the League of United Latin American Citizens drew attention to the fact 
that there were active police ofﬁcers who believed that it was a crime not to speak 
English (Goldstein 2009).

In addition, the study found that police ofﬁcers routinely misrepresented the race of 
the person receiving the ticket in their reports (Macmillan 2010).

Texas, 1995: A judge scolds a mother who speaks only Spanish to her 5-year-old 
daughter: “You’re abusing that child and you’re relegating her to the position of 
housemaid. Now, get this straight. You start speaking English to this child because 
if she doesn’t do good in school, then I can remove her because it’s not in her best 
interest to be ignorant. The child will only hear English” (Verhovek 1995). 
The most vulnerable 
Cirila Baltazar Cruz is a native of the Oaxaca region in isolated Southern Mexico, one 
known for its anthropological riches and for its extreme poverty.11 Cruz is a member of 
the indigenous Kitse Cha’tño, or Chatino tribe, which speaks a language which falls under 
the Zapotecan branch of the Oto-Manguean family. Chatino is nothing like Spanish; there 
is no mutual intelligibility. For example, here is a sentence in Chatino compared to 
Mexican Spanish and English: 
CHATINO: N-da nu xni’ ndaha ska ha xtlya ?i nu ‘o. 
N-da

Spanish

coyote 
SPANISH: El perro ﬂojo le dió un pan dulce al coyote. 
ENGLISH: The lazy dog gave a sweetbread to the coyote.12 
Cruz is a native speaker of Chatino; she speaks very little Spanish and no other language. 
As is common in her village, she never learned to read and write. Nevertheless, she left 
her children in her mother’s care and came to the U.S. to find work that would allow 
her to send money home to Oaxaca. She took employment at a Chinese restaurant in 
Pascagoula, Mississippi, and was supplied housing by her employer (Abierta 2009; Byrd 
2010a, 2010b; Cruz 2010; Macedo and Gounari 2006; Padgett and Mascareñas 2009; 
Southern Poverty Law Center 2010). 
In November of 2008, Cruz went to the Singing River Hospital and gave birth to a 
healthy daughter. Subsequently a Spanish-speaking patient advocate of Puerto Rican 
heritage and a social services representative came into Cruz’s room and questioned her. 
Cruz understood very little, but the social worker and patient advocate kept asking 
questions. At some point Cruz’s cousin, a ﬂuent speaker of Spanish and Chatino came to 
visit, and offered to translate. One of the social workers told him “that she was talking to 
[Cruz] and to keep his mouth shut.”13 The social workers insisted he wait in the hall. 
Rather than call in a Chatino translator, the social services representatives constructed 
a set of reasons to remove the child from her mother’s custody, including the charge that 
she traded sex for housing, that she had stated an intention to put the child up for adoption, 
that she was unprepared to care for the child and had not even purchased formula or a 
bassinet. Reporters from Mississippi’s Clarion Ledger were allowed to review documents 
outlining these charges and others, which included language-related charges: 
Cruz was charged with neglecting her child, in part, because “she has failed to learn 
the English language” and “was unable to call for assistance for transportation to the

----- Page 294 (native) -----
¡YA BASTA! 
269 
hospital” to give birth. Her inability to speak English “placed her unborn child in 
danger and will place the baby in danger in the future.” 
(Byrd 2010b) 
Without investigating or documenting any of these charges or presenting any evidence, 
the Mississippi Department of Human Services’ representatives used this narrative when 
they went before a judge, ﬁrst to gain permission to remove the child from her mother’s 
care, and later, to request termination of Cruz’s parental rights. 
Cruz was discharged from the hospital and told she could not take her daughter with 
her. When she returned the next day with her cousin to ask for her baby, she was told the 
child was no longer there. That day, two different social workers associated with the 
hospital contacted state and federal immigration authorities to report Cruz as an illegal 
alien (Padgett and Mascareñas 2009). 
The ofﬁcial complaint ﬁled by the attorneys representing Cruz outlined the charges: 
The individual defendants conspired to remove [Cruz’s newborn daughter] from her 
mother in order to place the infant child in the custody of a white local attorney couple 
who were seeking to adopt and who frequently practiced before the same judge who 
sanctioned the removal. In doing so, the individual Defendants deliberately took 
advantage of Plaintiff Baltazar Cruz’s indigence, inability to speak or understand 
English, and lack of familiarity with the U.S. legal system in order to attempt to 
remove [the child] permanently from her mother. 
As of this writing, the case has not yet gone to court, but the defendants have been charged 
with conspiring to violate Cruz’s constitutionally protected rights (due process, equal 
treatment, unreasonable seizure) and further, to deny Cruz and her daughter their con-
stitutional rights to family integrity. The charges are based on the accusation that these 
actions were taken on the basis of race and/or national origin. 
It wasn’t until the child was a year old that she was returned to Cruz, who then took 
her daughter home to Mexico. This very tardy reunion came about not because Mississippi 
took any steps to rectify the situation, but because of an investigation by the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Service’s Ofﬁce for Civil Rights and Administration 
for Children and Families. The letter written by the last agency to executive director of 
the Mississippi ofﬁce listed a number of infractions and violations of procedures. HHS 
expressed concerns about this case not just because of the nature of the violations, but 
because “The MDHS staff interviewed did not see these issues as problematic. This leads 
us to conclude that this may be how business is conducted and that this is not an isolated 
incident” (Byrd 2010b). 
The workplace 
As was seen in Chapter 9, Latinos/as are actively discriminated against in the workplace. 
Earlier in this chapter Barrett’s study of language ideology in an Anglo-owned Mexican 
restaurant provided another example in the form of a linguist’s first-person account. 
Two generalizations might be made at this point: first, Barrett’s study shows how 
deeply rationalizations for discriminatory behaviors are engrained, and, second, that the 
systematic, almost obligatory use of racist language and racist treatment toward Latinos/as 
is just obscure enough to keep such practices out of the courtroom.

Stepping back, it is clear that all employers, good, bad or indifferent, take a number of 
features into account to make initial, sometimes very hasty, yes/no hiring decisions. This 
happens as a matter of course, and for the most part, below the level of consciousness. 
Markley’s study of employers in Texas established that individuals were willing to make 
judgments on such things as intelligence and diligence on the basis of a recorded voice 
alone (Markley 2000). 
Such preconceptions mold the employers’ expectations for workers before they begin 
employment, and extend to strategic decisions with long-term impact (which individuals 
are suited for which positions, assumptions about skill sets and intelligence, who to train 
further). 
Maldonado (2009) set out to interview “forty employers from twenty-six farm opera-
tions and firms (packers/shippers, equipment and input suppliers, warehouses) repre-
senting the various sizes and types of agricultural operations in Washington” to gather 
data on Anglo/Latino relations in such settings. Of the 40 employers interviewed, 28 were 
Anglo, and each described without hesitation a division of labor based on race. Employers 
sometimes reacted with irritation or direct anger when asked about race or ethnicity; all 
had a set of arguments to rationalize or neutralize the inherent racism in their employment 
practices. Here is one example of an employer who has so naturalized racism in his view 
of the workplace that he doesn’t hesitate to provide answers that are clearly illogical: 
[T]he workers are one hundred percent Hispanic . . . [O]n all the ranches that I run 
. . . we have no Caucasian people at all . . . And the reason being is that we don’t get 
anybody applying for it. It’s mostly been just Hispanic people were applying. 
(Interviewer: How do you think it became that way?) Supply and demand, you know. 
Basic economics. 
(ibid.: 1024) 
The role of language in the racialization process comes out in an almost matter-of-fact 
way in another interview with an employer who rejects the necessity of talking about 
ethnicity or race at all: 
I, it just [laughs] I could, I could go into a whole soapbox in my opinion . . . Race, 
race is an issue in this country mainly because those populations want to keep it an 
issue in this country. When you really get to the hiring and, and ﬁring and who’s on 
your team type situation . . . it’s based, as far as I’m concerned, on performance. I 
don’t care if you’re from Mars; if you can do the job and you can communicate with 
me . . . and do it effectively, hey, you’re hired. 
(ibid.: 1023) 
The employer begins a sentence “If you can do the job and communicate with me” and 
then pauses. That pause signals the speaker’s reaching for a phrase that will qualify and 
restrict the first part of the sentence. “If you can communicate with me and do it 
effectively” could be read thus: There are two necessary qualiﬁcations if you want to work with 
me. You have to be able to do the job, and you have to be able to make me understand you. Thus 
the employer is anticipating communication breakdown and handing the responsibility 
for successful communication to the worker alone. This is, in itself, not a violation of any 
law; an employer may reasonably require that an employee be able to communicate with 
him or her. What is interesting about this exchange is the tone.

Racism is often expressed in this off-hand way, just as the rationalizations offered are 
usually pretextual, and the logic spurious. As in this case: 
He told me quite frankly that he would never hire anyone with a strong foreign accent, 
and especially not a Mexican accent. I asked him why. His only response was, “That’s 
smart business. I have to think of the customers. I wouldn’t buy anything from a guy 
with a Mexican accent.” 
(Spicher 1992: 3–4) 
Whether or not it is actually smart business to willfully ignore the needs and wants of a 
population of many millions of consumers is doubtful. Nevertheless, this anecdote is more 
useful than any number of statistics, because it makes some things painfully clear: the 
degree of accent is irrelevant when the focus is not on content, but form. The businessman 
cannot conceive of a middle-class, Spanish-speaking population with money to spend, and 
therefore the entire Mexican American population is worthy of rejection. 
Education in the Southwest 
There is a long and well-documented history of discrimination toward Spanish-speaking 
populations in the Southwest. Some of the most destructive policies have been practiced 
in education,14 where Mexican children were routinely segregated into poorly staffed and 
overcrowded schools. Such practices ended – in theory – in 1954 with Brown v. Board of 
Education, when the Supreme Court struck down separate but equal policies. The most 
blatant forms of segregation lessened, but Latino/a children were – and are still – periph-
eralized, segregated, unfairly and incorrectly funneled into special education classrooms, 
denied opportunities readily available to Anglos, and forbidden to speak their own 
language even in one-on-one conversations on the playground. 
Gandara and Orﬁeld (2010) and Po (2010) present a stark picture of linguistic segre-
gation in Arizona schools while Bratt’s “Violence in the Curriculum: Compulsory 
Linguistic Discrimination in the Arizona-Sonora Borderlands” (2007) is a sobering look 
at the way institutionalized linguistic discrimination puts teachers and children on opposite 
sides of a great gulf, creating an antagonism that can, in extreme moments, end in physical 
violence. In Bratt’s experience in Arizona, school districts create extreme English-Only 
policies tougher than the State guidelines, so that “teachers in more than one elementary 
district in rural Arizona are summarily ﬁred if they are heard speaking Spanish, even to 
prevent an accident on the playground” (ibid.: 3). 
Structured programs designed to help English language learners toward proﬁciency 
have had exactly the opposite result (Gandara and Orﬁeld 2010), in large part because 
English speakers and English learners rarely interact, so that those with limited English 
proﬁciency are isolated from those situations where English is spoken: 
Our analysis of the hyper-segregation of Hispanic students, and particularly Spanish-
speaking [English language learners], suggests that little or no attention has been 
given to the consequences of linguistic isolation for a population whose future depends 
on the acquisition of English . . . For ELLs, interaction with ordinary English-
speaking peers is essential to their English language development and consequently 
to their acquisition of academic English. 
(Gifford and Valdés 2006: as cited in Gandara and Orﬁeld 2010)

¡YA BASTA! 
There have been periods when Arizona’s policies emerged from the grip of moral panic 
to more inclusive approaches.15 A broad bilingual-education program was put in place 
in the 1990s, which resulted in the hiring of several hundred native Spanish-speaking 
teachers, some from outside the U.S. (Gandara and Orﬁeld 2010). Even in such open-
minded and progressive periods, the underlying ideology has been anti-immigrant and 
anti-bilingual “serving to privilege the English-speaking Anglo majority and to marginalize 
and disenfranchise the Spanish-speaking Latino minority” (Cashman 2009: 45). And 
indeed, the progress of the 1990s was being reversed by 2000 when a ballot measure 
forbidding use of any language other than English in the classroom was passed. 
Issues around language are tied to questions around immigration, arguably the most 
divisive topic in Arizona’s post-colonial history. As is usually the case with immigration-
focused extremism, anti-immigration rhetoric ﬂares up in times of economic downturn. 
At the writing of the second edition of this book, the U.S. is “in the midst of the largest 
influx of immigrants in a century. . . a record in absolute numbers but still somewhat 
smaller proportion of the total population than was the case a century ago” (Hakimzadeh 
and Cohn 2007). 
Certainly the country’s fragile economy contributed to the fervor around two bills 
signed into law in April 2010 by Arizona governor Jan Brewer. State Bill 1070 aims to 
“identify, prosecute and deport illegal immigrants” (Archibold 2010a) in ways that 
opponents and critics ﬁnd extreme to the point of violating basic human rights set forth 
in the U.S. Constitution. The targeting of the Mexican population has earned 1070 the 
nickname the Breathing while Brown Bill (Lemons 2010) an indication of the extreme 
anxiety the bill evokes among the Latino population, whether they are citizens, legal 
residents, or undocumented workers (Archibold 2010b). McKinley’s report from Arizona 
quoted one bystander: “If they look at someone and they are of Mexican descent, they are 
going to be guilty until proven innocent,” she said. “It makes you guilty for being brown” 
(McKinley 2010). 
Challenges were quickly ﬁled in the court by civil rights scholars and activists, professors 
of law and linguistics, the Mexican government, the ACLU and the U.S. Justice 
Department (McKinley 2010). Vivek Malhotra, the advocacy and policy council for the 
American Civil Liberties Union, summarized Arizona’s new immigration laws quite neatly. 
“This law does nothing short of making all of its Latino residents, and other presumed 
immigrants, potential criminal suspects in the eyes of the law” (Archibold 2010d). 
SB 1070 was written and publicized in a combative tone that caught the media’s atten-
tion. HR 2083, also signed by the governor in April 2010, was launched more quietly. 
This newer bill was strikingly different in one important way. While SB 1070’s focus was 
undocumented workers, HR 2083 focus shifts to the rest of the population, those who 
were born in the U.S. or came to the country through ofﬁcial routes, but who still self-
identify as Mexican. 
HR 2083 prohibits schools from offering courses at any grade level that advocate ethnic 
solidarity, promote overthrow of the U.S. government, or cater to speciﬁc ethnic groups. 
Observers posed many questions raised by the odd wording: 
Are Arizona schools in the habit of promoting the overthrow of the government? Is 
there an implicit accusation here? 
Does the school board mean ethnicity distinct from race? Would this include any 
ethnicity? So for example, a course offered to advanced students in high school on

----- Page 298 (native) -----
¡YA BASTA! 
273 
the French Revolution, the Irish–English conﬂicts, the economics of the Middle East, 
these would all be prohibited? 
Advocating ethnic solidarity – could that include discussion of our own Revolution? 
In fact, the purpose of this law is very narrow: it was written to dismantle a popular 
and successful Mexican-American studies program in the Tucson school district. 
(Calefati 2010; Kurowski 2010; Strauss 2010a, 2010b) 
The law was written and promoted by Tom Horne, the state superintendent of public 
instruction, a man in a heated race for attorney general against an opponent known for 
his extreme stance on immigration. Khimm (2010) quotes Horne as he justiﬁes the bill as 
a way to target speciﬁc courses in Tucson where Latino/a students are inculcated with 
“‘ethnic chauvinism’ . . . he skips straight to the inﬂammatory charge that [ethnic studies 
classes] could encourage students to revolt against U.S. government, effectively legit-
imizing fears of a Mexican ‘reconquista’” (ibid.). In this view of ethnic studies, students 
and teachers are all seen as seditionists. 
Horne’s personal animosity toward a specific program attended by 3 percent of the 
55,000 students in the Tucson school district has wide-reaching implications (Calefati 
2010). Latinos may ﬁll almost 50 percent of the classrooms in Arizona, but because Horne 
has a vested interest in the moral panic he is fostering, children of Latino/a, African or 
Asian backgrounds will be forbidden to learn about their heritage in school. 
Finally, the State Education Ofﬁce took the opportunity provided by the passage of 
these two bills to put new policies in place that target teachers who speak Spanish as a 
native language, or English with an accent. Reportedly based on the federal No Child Left 
Behind Act, the Arizona provision requires that teachers who teach English to English 
language learners (that is, Latinos/as who speak Spanish as a ﬁrst language) must be “ﬂuent 
in every aspect of the English language” (Calefati 2010). The person at the Arizona 
department of education who is charged with enforcing this new rule has been quite 
speciﬁc on the record: 
“The teacher obviously must be ﬂuent in every aspect of the English language,” said 
Adela Santa Cruz, director of the Arizona education-department ofﬁce charged with 
enforcing standards in classes for students with limited English. The education 
department has dispatched evaluators to audit teachers across the state on things such 
as comprehensible pronunciation, correct grammar and good writing. 
Teachers that don’t pass muster may take classes or other steps to improve their 
English; if ﬂuency continues to be a problem, Ms. Santa Cruz said, it is up to school 
districts to decide whether to ﬁre teachers or reassign them to mainstream classes not 
designated for students still learning to speak English. 
(Jordan 2010) 
Very little information is publicly available on the details of this policy. Strauss (2010c) 
interviewed a spokesperson from the Department of Education, who provided a list of 
school districts that were being monitored, for example: “2009–10 school year – The 
education department monitored 61 districts and found 9 districts were cited for ﬂuency” 
(ibid.). The school district stated that no teachers were dismissed or transferred on the 
basis of lack of ﬂuency, but there was no further information or documentation.

----- Page 299 (native) -----

¡YA BASTA! 
Neither was there any background on the inspectors, what kind of training they had to 
qualify them, or whether there was any conﬂict of interest (for example, will any of them 
make a living in the accent reduction business?). There are no deﬁnitions of accent or 
grammar or even of the concept of ﬂuency. Yet these inspectors hold the fate of hundreds 
of teachers in their hands. 
As we have seen before, teachers are also protected under Title VII, and may not be 
dismissed or refused promotion on the basis of accent linked to national origin unless that 
accent makes it impossible for the employee to accomplish assigned work. Thus, if any 
teachers are reassigned or dismissed on this basis and they pursue a legal challenge, it 
would be up to Horne to prove that a native Spanish-speaking teacher is detrimental to 
the educational welfare of a Spanish-speaking child. 
Aside from the question of civil rights and Title VII, the logic presented here is spurious. 
If only native English speakers should teach those who come to school with limited English 
proﬁciency, then by extension French classes must be taught by native French teachers, 
and Japanese by native Japanese speakers. The study of second language acquisition – and 
common sense – are enough to establish the fact that speaking a language is not sufﬁcient 
training to teach it effectively. 
Taken as a whole, these two new laws and the new educational policy present a disturbing 
picture of a state and population in the grip of a moral panic, where common sense and 
(some would argue) common decency have been sacriﬁced in order to assuage fears. As is 
usually the case in a moral panic, there is some rationale not very far in the background: 
demographics will continue to shift toward a Latino/a majority, so that sometime in the 
not too distant future, Anglos will no longer have numerical superiority. The question is, 
does it make sense to alienate and anger those people who will one day be the majority? 
Hypothetically speaking 
Consider this set of possibilities: 
The U.S. Census estimates that in the year 2030 Arizona will be only 30 percent Anglo 
or native English speakers. Another 58 percent will be Spanish speaking, and the 
remainder are Native American tribes who govern themselves and set their own 
policies. 
Imagine that in 2031, the State government of Arizona votes new legislation into 
place, which splits pretty much 30/65 percent along ethnicity and language lines. The 
governor vetoes the bill; the legislature overrides the veto. Spanish is now the ofﬁcial 
language of Arizona. The new bill includes the following sections: 
Article I: Spanish is the ofﬁcial language of the state of Arizona. 
Article II: The civil administration, the health services and social services, the 
public utility enterprises, the professional corporations, the associations of 
employees and all enterprises doing business in Arizona will institute Spanish-
only policies. 
Article III: All governmental ofﬁces and parliamentary structures will conduct 
business in Spanish. 
Article IV: Workers will not be required or encouraged to speak any language 
other than Spanish.

----- Page 300 (native) -----
¡YA BASTA! 
275 
Article V: All consumer information must be in Spanish. 
Article VI: All public education at all levels is to be conducted exclusively in 
Spanish. English will not be used or heard in any Arizona school with the 
exception of classes in which the English language is being taught. 
Article VII: Product labels, their instructions, manuals, warranty certiﬁcates as 
well as restaurant menus and wine lists must be in Spanish. All street signs, 
including shop signs, must be in Spanish. Violations will be heavily ﬁned. 
Article IX: Catalogues, brochures, folders, commercial directories and other such 
publications, must be in the ofﬁcial language. All software (for example, video 
games and operating systems) must be available in Spanish by the year 2035. 
This will most likely strike you as absurd. It’s too extreme in the way it simply nulliﬁes 
the rights of native and/or monolingual English speakers. Such sweeping legislation must 
be challenged immediately in the courts. 
But such things have happened, and there’s a present-day example very close to home. 
In 1763, the French withdrew from North America and at that point Canada became 
a British possession. The British colonial policy was to make the world England, and that 
process began immediately with a new English-speaking government and upper class 
dominating business and social circles. With the immigration of large numbers of British 
people, business trade shifted away from the traditional French merchants; the fate of the 
French who had been in Quebec since the ﬁrst European settlements were made clear: 
you must assimilate. 
French speakers were shut out of the most inﬂuential aspects of ofﬁcial life, and a tiered 
system developed in which Anglophones (English speakers, the British) constituted the 
governing classes; to be a Francophone was to be associated with the laboring classes. 
Francophones were at a marked disadvantage in every way; their children were segregated 
from Anglophone schoolchildren and had fewer possibilities in terms of education and 
training. 
Of course, French did not die out. A large, healthy, well-established language commu-
nity does not simply buckle under in the face of governmental decree. The Francophone 
population regrouped and began to ﬁnd their way back. 
In 1974, a new Francophone-dominant province government passed an Official 
Language Act with the intention of making French the normal, everyday language of work, 
instruction, communication, commerce and business. Another Bill (Loi 101) was passed 
in 1977 which went into much greater detail. In fact, all of the provisions suggested above 
were included, almost word for word in Bill 101.16 
As is so often the tendency when power structures are concentrated in a small section 
of the community, the oppressed had become the oppressors (Freire 2000 [1970]).17 The 
Francophone government asserted its right to exclude all things Anglophone, and they do 
so still. One example of many is Bob Rice’s story. 
A Québécois from birth and an Anglophone, Bob ran into trouble with an apostrophe, 
and it cost him dearly. 
One day in 2004, Bob Rice received a ticket in the mail. Its intention wasn’t very clear, 
but eventually he ﬁgured out that he was being ﬁned by the Ofﬁce Québécois de la langue 
française (Quebec Ofﬁce of the French Language) because they had a complaint from a 
neighbor about the apostrophe on the sign for his plumbing company: Bob’s (Figure 14.7).

----- Page 301 (native) -----
276 
¡YA BASTA! 
Figure 14.7 Bob’s Plumbing 
The Quebec ofﬁce of the French Language is responsible for enforcing the language 
legislation, which outlaws apostrophes in public signs. The reasoning here is that the 
province laws stipulate French-only on all public signs, and there is no apostrophe in the 
possessive form Bobs, in French. 
Bob was given a $599 ﬁne and a $187 delivery charge for the ticket. If he did not pay 
within the week, his pickup truck, farm tractor and car would be sold at an auction in his 
yard. Bob paid the ﬁnes, and solved the problem of the apostrophe by covering it up with 
a sticker of the Canadian ﬂag. 
Summary 
Americans tend to think of monolingualism as the default. For whatever reason – educa-
tional gaps, ideology, mythology – most of us imagine that Spanish is spoken in Spain, 
Polish in Poland, and so on. 
In fact, monolingualism is the exception across the world’s populations, and that is the 
case even if you exclude consideration of immigrant languages. This is quite logical if you 
consider for a moment that national political boundaries change over time, usually as the 
result of war or its aftermath. The current boundaries of France include areas which were 
once Spain, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Germany. When the borders moved, the 
populations (for the most part) stayed put. For example, Occitan is a romance language 
closely related to Catalan. There are native speakers and small Occitan language com-
munities in France, Monaco, Italy, and Spain. Occitan is just one example of the dozens 
of indigenous languages in Spain other than Spanish. 
A government may make laws declaring one language to be the ofﬁcial language of the 
nation, but the facts indicate a different reality. This is true of every country in Europe 
and the world. It is true of the United States. Every few years a wave of protest washes 
over us, and a subset of the people demand that English be acknowledged as the country’s 
one true language. In some cases it seems that people actually believe that such a thing is 
possible, and all it will take is a law to render us monolingual. 
Such laws are primarily symbolic, of course. The demand for an English monolingual 
U.S. is akin to saying: We’re first. We’re best. Everybody needs to acknowledge that, and 
unwillingness to do so is. . . un-American! There are no rational arguments for this position. 
English-Only proponents can only appeal to majority rule, but even that can be challenged 
by invoking the Bill of Rights, and in any case, numerical superiority is slipping away in 
many places. 
The U.S. is a multilingual nation, and our two most prevalent languages are English 
and Spanish. Whatever laws we pass, whatever language planning documents we write, 
those facts are undeniable. In the end, language will not be legislated.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
Listen to Andre Codrescu’s essay “Arizona Education Loses the Accent of America” 
(2010) on National Public Radio. Does his perspective change your thoughts about 
anything in this chapter? How is it relevant to the chapter – and book – in a broader 
sense? Radio link is available at: http://goo.gl/xGErO. 
Davila (Davila et al. 1993) undertook a preliminary, explorative statistical analysis of 
earnings by three groups of workers in the U.S.: Mexican Americans, German Americans 
and Italian Americans who speak their heritage language at home (and thus, Davila et al. 
postulated, spoke with an accent). In fact, the analysis indicated that those of Mexican 
ancestry earned signiﬁcantly less than the other two groups. They suggest that Mexicans 
who have a closer afﬁnity to their heritage culture pay a penalty for that preference, but 
they also list a number of other possible reasons for the discrepancy in earnings. Discuss 
what you think those reasons may be. Think in terms of immigration history and trends, 
geographic distribution, and legal considerations in addition to ethnicity and language. 
Consider the history of discriminatory practices taken against Native Americans as 
described brieﬂy in Chapter 7, and compare that information (and any other research 
you might do on this topic) to Padgett’s Time Magazine article about the Cruz case in 
Mississippi. What similarities do you see? How relevant are they to language-focused 
discrimination? 
Make a list of terms for people of Latino origin. (If you are yourself Latino/a, you can still 
undertake this exercise – but you should concentrate on non-Spanish speakers when 
collecting data. (If you are not comfortable with this, you could take a different approach, 
and make a similar list of Spanish language terms for non-Spanish speakers in the U.S.) 
Ask acquaintances, friends, family for help. In class, ﬁnd a way to divide all the terms 
collected into groups. Are some terms purely derogatory and racist? Are there neutral 
terms which seem to be fairly safe; that is, they won’t offend the majority of Latinos? How 
many of the terms do you use yourself, and which ones do you avoid? Can you 
reconstruct what goes through your mind if/when you use a term like “wetback”? This is 
not meant to be an exercise in blame; the purpose is to pinpoint the way you have learned 
to think about a particular ethnic group. 
Consider the Arizona School Board’s intention to send out inspectors to decide whether 
a teacher speaks English ﬂuently enough to work with Spanish-speaking children who 
are learning English. Can you imagine putting together a program (training the investi-
gators, etc.) that would reach judicious, consistent evaluations? What would that look 
like? 
How is the language situation in Quebec relevant to the conﬂicts in the U.S. Southwest? 
Do you feel the Francophone laws in Quebec were well founded? Reasonable? 
Understandable? What do you think might happen if/when the Spanish-speaking 
population of Arizona reaches a strong majority? 
Explore the Pew Hispanic Center Web site by following the link to “Reports.” Identify an 
issue that is (a) language related; and (b) could be addressed, at least in part, by “making 
the invisible visible” to Anglos. 
Consider the Census maps from the 2007 American Community Survey in this chapter. 
Note that those areas of the country which are most heavily bilingual Spanish/English

are not necessarily the areas where English language facility is lowest. Why might that 
be, for example, in New Mexico? 
“Discomfort is not oppression. It is a sign of privilege when white students believe they 
should be able to understand everything going on around them or never have their racial 
embodiment questioned publicly.” Discuss.

3 Salazar was a major ﬁgure in the Chicano movement. A respected journalist and writer 
for The Los Angeles Times, Salazar was killed by a sheriff’s deputy while reporting on a 
Chicano protest of the Vietnam War. His death helped focus the country’s attention 
on discrimination against Chicanos. 
4 Originally the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo guaranteed that Mexican citizens who 
stayed a year in the territories newly ceded to the U.S. would be granted U.S. 
citizenship. Like other provisions of the treaty, Congress summarily deleted these 
promises before ratiﬁcation. 
5 It is important to note that Spanish is not the only language spoken in the countries 
identiﬁed as Hispanic. The Mexican population of more than 104 million includes 
more than 8 million speakers of indigenous Indian languages (about 8 percent 
of Mexico’s total population), of whom almost half a million are monolingual and 
speak no Spanish at all (Lewis 2009). Guatemala’s population of 9.3 million is approxi-
mately 55 percent Indian and 44 percent Mestizo. The Indian population includes

(ibid.).

of endorsement of code switching as the basis of language policy in educational setting. 
7 In her (1995) book Verbal Hygiene, Cameron has an excellent discussion of the term 
“politically correct” that is well worth reading. 
8 Gómez uses the term “off-white” but notes: “I might just as easily use the term ‘off-
black’ to describe Mexican Americans’ in-between status. Employing the term ‘off-
white,’ however, invites focus on Mexicans’ striving (but rarely succeeding) for white 
status and equality with whites” (2007: 163).

14 This was true also for African Americans and Native Americans. In the case of Native 
Americans (see “Good Enough English” in Chapter 7), children were often forcibly 
removed from their families to boarding schools in a last ditch attempt to break 
resistance to assimilation, in part by denying them their own languages. While Latino 
challenges to segregation in the schools had some success, the African American efforts 
in the courts did not (Powers 2008: 470).

17 Paulo Freire is considered one of the founders of critical pedagogy; his most cited 
work is Pedagogy of the Oppressed (2000 [1970]). The irony is that Horne has banned 
that particular book in Arizona schools: 
Mr. Horne goes way overboard in trying to keep high school students from 
studying works like Paulo Freire’s ‘Pedagogy of the Oppressed,’ a classic 
educational text, or any effort to deepen students’ understanding of history, 
and their place in the world.

The unassimilable races 
15 
What it means to be Asian 
There are lots of issues that Asian Americans share, . . . one being the immigrant 
experience, being relatively recent immigrant arrivals. And Asians also suffer from a 
perpetual-foreigner syndrome, meaning that you could be a fourth- or fifth-
generation Asian American but still somehow it’s difﬁcult to believe that you’re an 
American. I get that: First they compliment me on my ability to speak English, and 
often I get asked, “Well, where are you from?” and for some reason people refuse to 
take Flushing for an answer. 
John Lui, attributed 
Institutionalized aggression 
Formal, institutionalized policies that target Asian populations have a long history in the 
U.S., something that we tend to forget. A short overview: 
1790  Congress decrees that “any alien, being a free white person who shall have 
resided within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the United States for a 
term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen thereof.” The “free 
white person” element was retained until “persons of African descent” was 
added in 1873. Cargile (2010) notes that while this was a major civil rights 
victory, it also alienated Latinos and Asians: “their status as ‘outsiders’ was 
now ﬁrmly ﬁxed in a society only able to see in black and white” (ibid.: 60). 
1882 
President Garﬁeld vetoes the Chinese Exclusion Act; Congress rallies a three-
quarter majority to override the veto so that Chinese are not allowed to 
immigrate. 
1885 
Anglo miners riot against Chinese workers. Twenty-eight Chinese1 laborers 
are killed in the riots. 
1905 
Anti-Japanese rhetoric escalates. Newspapers fuel this panic, and the Asiatic 
Exclusion League is formed in San Francisco. 
1922 
The Cable Act revokes the U.S. citizenship of any woman who marries an 
Asian. 
1923  
A Japanese immigrant challenges the Exclusion Act so that he might become 
a naturalized citizen (Takao Ozawa v. United States), and the Supreme Court 
rules that the Japanese – and all other Asians – are unassimilable races and 
thereby ineligible. A few months later the Supreme Court rules that while 
Bhagat Singh Thind, a native of Punjab, is Caucasian, he is not white. In 
accordance with the Congressional Act of 1790, this means Thind cannot

apply for American citizenship, and further, all natives of India who were 
naturalized citizens at the time were stripped of that status. 
1933 
Time Magazine runs a story with the headline Again: Yellow Peril: 
Japan has driven a strategic wedge of Japanese dominion between the two 
American island possessions, the Philippines and the Hawaiian Islands . . . 
Japan’s purpose is obviously to absorb both of these American possessions 
. . . The Philippines we are helping the Japanese to acquire through our 
political corruption and stupidity. 
1942  
A few months after the Japanese military attacks Pearl Harbor, President 
Roosevelt signs Executive Order 9066, which allows military authorities to 
take whatever action they deem necessary to contain Asian presence. There 
is no right to a trial or representation. The end result is the removal of 
Japanese Americans to internment camps. 
1964  
The California Initiative allowing landlords to discriminate passes with 
65 percent of the vote. At that point, a property owner could refuse to lease, 
rent or sell housing or property on the basis of race, ethnicity, or anything 
else he or she cared to name. 
As laws and protections have evolved, overt discriminatory acts have diminished. Of course 
this does not mean the end of anti-Asian sentiment or action. In earlier chapters we saw 
that Asians are discriminated against in the workplace, in the courts and in education, and 
that this is true for new immigrants who speak English as a second language, for U.S. 
citizens who speak Hawai’i Creole, and even for those of Asian origin who are monolingual 
English speakers and have no foreign accent at all. 
Half the world 
While immigrants from Asia were once largely Japanese and Chinese, that is no longer the 
case. By the time of the 2000 census, there were six large Asian groups in the U.S. (Chinese, 
Filipino, Indian, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) that together made up 88 percent of 
the whole (Park 2008: 543). These six nations are both internally and externally diverse in 
terms of culture, politics, religion, and language. Most non-Asians are unaware of this level 
of complexity. 
It is useful to note that taken together, the eight most populous Asian nations are home 
to about 3.5 billion persons, or about half of the world’s population.2 
Despite all this, the U.S. government has only one term that lumps all of these nations, 
ethnicities, cultures and languages from the Far East, Southeast Asia, and the Indian 
subcontinent together: Asian (Table 15.1). 
While it may be an unreasonable burden on the U.S. Census Bureau to take note of 
each and every world language spoken in the U.S., the great disparity in the level of detail 
we employ to characterize the world’s populations bears some consideration. Asian is not 
a comfortable term for many of the people we assign it to. For example, when asked about 
the place of India in Asia, one person of Southeast Asian heritage was hesitant: 
That’s a tough one because [when] I hear the term Asian American I consider them 
[Asian Indians] as separate, not Asian. I know India is located [in] Asia but then I 
always thought of it as separate . . . because to me it seems different. 
(Park 2008)

Most non-Asians show little curiosity or even basic knowledge about the world outside 
the U.S. I would suggest that this is due, in large part, to the fact that geography instruction 
has almost disappeared from school system curricula. The National Geographic Society, 
concerned about this trend, hired Roper Public Affairs to conduct a study (2006) to 
ascertain the depths of the problem. In the resulting report, it was established that even 
politicians – the very people responsible for maintaining international relations – are likely 
to get basic facts wrong.3 The situation is far worse for young adults. In their sample: 
86 percent could not identify four countries in the Middle East on a map. 
69 percent could not pick out China on a map of Asia (Figure 15.1). 
65 percent could not locate the United Kingdom on a map. 
50 percent could not pinpoint New York State on a map of the U.S. 
One item on the poll is of particular interest here. When asked “Which language is spoken 
by the most people in the world as their primary language?” 74 percent answered English; 
only 18 percent gave the correct answer (Mandarin Chinese). The Roper Report suggests 
that there is a connection between the general false belief in the primacy of English and 
the fact that 62 percent of our young adults do not speak any foreign language (ibid.: 33). 
This general lack of knowledge about the world could be attributed to the gap in the 
curriculum, but then we must ask ourselves how this gap came to be. In times of budgetary 
shortfalls, the programs that get cut are the ones we feel we can do without. While talk 
of diversity and a wider world, global perspective is popular, in practice, ethnocentrism is 
well established on the individual and institutional level (Kinder and Kam 2009). Language 
plays a central role in the structuring of these hierarchies: 
Underlying the intersection of language and race is a language ideology that we call 
the ideology of nativeness, an Us-versus-Them division of the linguistic world in 
which native and nonnative speakers of a language are thought to be mutually

exclusive, uncontested, identiﬁable groups. At the core of this ideological model is a 
view of the world’s speech communities as naturally monolingual and monocultural, 
whereby one language is semiotically associated with one nation. 
(Shuck 2006) 
More speciﬁcally, Devos and Banaji (2005) conducted a series of six quantitative studies 
to answer a straightforward question: “Do people differentiate between ethnic groups 
within the concept of ‘American’?” The data gave them a simple answer: “To be American 
is to be White” (ibid.: 463). The college students who participated in the study were 
unambiguous in their view of the relationship between race and belonging. Even when an 
individual subscribes to the belief that all races and ethnicities are entitled to equal human 
rights and liberties, there is still “an exceptionally large effect demonstrating, at least 
among White American students, a strong automatic association between American and 
White compared with American and Asian” (ibid.: 452–453). 
There is a large body of scholarly work that has examined the complicated way Asians 
are perceived – and how they perceive themselves as residents and citizens of the U.S. 
Some of the ﬁndings include:

THE UNASSIMILABLE RACES 
285 
Native English speakers are not good at identifying Asian accents on the basis of voice 
alone (Lindemann 2002, 2005); however, many people believe that they are, in fact, 
quite capable of distinguishing, for example, Japanese from Chinese, or India from 
Pakistan.4 In a situation where the speakers see each other, the non-Asian will some-
times hear a foreign accent that is not there, a phenomenon called accent hallucination 
(Atagi 2003; Fought 2006; Rubin 1992; Rubin and Smith 1990). 
The communicative burden is usually divided unequally, the brunt of this responsibility 
resting on the non-native English speaker; however, it is possible to ameliorate this 
tendency, though few take the time and trouble to do so (Derwing et al. 2002). 
Native English speakers are willing to judge Asian learners of English – their intelli-
gence, friendliness, work ethic and many other complex personality traits – on the 
basis of very little information – as long as there is no ambiguity about race. That is, 
race sometimes has more of an effect than actual English language skills when such 
judgments are made (Barry and Grilo 2003; Devos and Banaji 2005). 
Negative attitudes about Asians, whether they are conscious or not, can make 
successful communication difﬁcult or impossible (Cargile 2010; Cheryan and Monin 
2005; Lindemann 2002, 2003, 2005). Asians are still seen – and may always be seen – 
as the Other, and not authentic Americans (Park 2008; Pyke and Dang 2003; 
Rosenbloom and Way 2004; Volpp 2001; Wang 2008; Yoo et al. 2009). 
Microagressive behaviors which may seem simply rude or uninformed are rampant and 
contribute to an overall atmosphere of other-ness. Examples: “All Asians look alike,” “I 
used to have a Japanese neighbor” (Sue et al. 2007). It must be clear to anyone familiar 
with the way language subordination works that the history of institutionalized dis-
crimination against Asians has had a broad and negative impact on self-image and self-
conﬁdence (Cargile 2010; Cheryan and Bodenhausen 2000; Cheryan and Monin 2005; 
Goyette and Xie 1999; Kawai 2005; Park 2008; Pyke and Dang 2003; Rim 2009; Sue et 
al. 2007; Tamura 1994; Tsai et al. 2002; Wu 2002). 
Stereotypes 
The evidence establishes that the concept Asian evokes an association not with a speciﬁc 
nation or geographical region, but with race. In the general view of things, anyone with 
a particular bone structure and skin color will count as Asian. Take, for example, the way 
Asian stereotypes are used in entertainment ﬁlm as a kind of shorthand, as in the 1993 
ﬁlm Falling Down: 
The proprietor, a middle-aged ASIAN, reads a Korean newspaper . . . the Asian has 
a heavy accent . . . 
D-FENS: . . .You give me seventy “ﬁe” cents back for the phone . . . What is a ﬁe? 
There’s a “V” in the word. Fie-vuh. Don’t they have “v”s in China? 
ASIAN: Not Chinese, I am Korean. 
D-FENS: Whatever. What differences does that make? You come over here and take 
my money and you don’t even have the grace to learn to speak my language . . . 
(1993: 7–8) 
D-Fens, the white-collar worker on the edge of his sanity does not distinguish between 
Chinese and Korean; that is not important to him. The Korean has committed three sins

----- Page 311 (native) -----
286 
THE UNASSIMILABLE RACES 
in D-Fens’s eyes: he has “come over here” and having immigrated, he “takes my money” 
by establishing himself in a social position in which he has economic capital and goods to 
dispense. These sins are compounded by the fact that the shop owner “doesn’t have the 
grace to learn to speak my language.” 
Of course, the claims are erroneous: the shop owner does speak English. He speaks 
English well enough to get into a rousing argument with the customer, to assert his rights 
as owner of the shop, and to ask the customer to leave. But, crucially, he does not speak 
English to the customer’s satisfaction, because he speaks English with an Asian accent. 
Here we are reminded of Heath’s characterization of situations in which non-native 
speakers of English gain social or economic currency: “their language has become a focus 
for arguments in favor of both restrictions of their use and imposition of Standard 
American English” (Heath et al. 1981: 10). 
Non-native English-speaking Asian Americans, as a large and diverse group, experience 
something in common, regardless of their economic status, education, or national origin: 
there is a special stigma attached to their presence which is externalized in reactions to 
the way they speak English. So conditioned are we to expect a different world view, a 
different accent, that we hear one where none is present. Individuals experience this 
regularly. 
A young woman of Asian Indian heritage, but a native and monolingual speaker of 
English, relates a story in which a middle-aged man in a music store is unable to help her 
when she asks for a recently released Depeche Mode tape (Kapoor 1993). “You’ll have to 
speak slower because I didn’t understand you because of your accent,” he tells her. She is 
understandably hurt and outraged: “I have no discernible accent. I do, however, have long 
dark hair and pleasantly colored brown skin. I suppose this outward appearance of mine 
constitutes enough evidence to conclude I had, indeed, just jumped off the boat and into 
the store.” 
The pain of this experience is real whether or not a foreign accent is present. In this 
case, the harm was real, but without repercussions which affected the young woman in a 
material way. Others are less fortunate: 
In February 1992, at the Department of the Treasury building on Main Street in San 
Francisco, a Treasury ofﬁcial called down to the lobby with a question. Irritated by the 
quality of response that he or she received, this official made a formal complaint of 
“communication difﬁculties” based on Filipino accent. He or she did not provide the name 
of the security guard responsible for the poor service. Subsequent to this report, the 
General Services Authority directed the subcontractor who supplied the security guards 
to remove all ﬁve Filipino agents who had been on duty that evening, due to “language barriers” 
(Cacas 1994). The men removed from their positions were not given regular employment 
at another site, but were used as ﬁll-ins on a variety of assignments, which caused them 
signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and other problems. 
This kind of treatment is not unusual, but the reaction of the men in question was quite 
remarkable. As a group, they sued their employer under Title VII, in order to restore their 
honor and dignity. For Filipino Americans, the charge of insufﬁcient or inadequate English 
is especially stinging, as English is one of the primary languages of education in their 
homeland, where in the 1975 census more than 15,000 claimed it as a ﬁrst language and 
almost half a million listed it as a second language in 1980 (Lewis 2009). The ﬁve men in 
question had lived in the U.S. for most of their lives, and their public comments on the 
case left no doubt that the harm was as much emotional as economic: “It was a slap to my 
face,” “It deeply hurt my feelings” (Ancheta 2006; Doyle 1994; Tiongson et al. 2006).

In fact, the attorneys for the security guards established that they were qualiﬁed and 
experienced workers, with between three and nine years on the job without any complaints 
about their language abilities. The Filipino security guards won their lawsuit, but a 
question was never raised: how was it that an anonymous ofﬁcial could bring about the 
removal of ﬁve men with solid work histories, solely on the basis of an unsubstantiated 
claim of an irritating and distracting accent? If the guards in question had been Italian or 
Norwegian speakers, would the same progression of events be imaginable? 
Our relationship to the Far East and Paciﬁc is shaped to a great degree by the facts of 
nineteenth-century colonialism, in which the U.S., young in comparative terms, followed 
the European model in targeting smaller nations to dominate – politically, economically 
and socially. We have a history of dealing with the Asian world as a warehouse of persons 
and goods available to suit our own purpose and ﬁll our own needs, a practice rationalized 
by the supposition that those people are inherently weaker. 
In order for such rationalizations to work, Asians must be seen as manipulative, with a 
tendency to use natural wiles and treachery to achieve their own ends. This kind of 
thinking provides a way to justify aggression. Thus a prominent Asian stereotype is of an 
intelligent, clever, but crafty and unreliable person. A secondary stereotype grows out of 
the mystiﬁcation of Asia, the mysterious Orient where hard-working but simple people 
ply their crafts and study arcane philosophies, attaining wisdom and a spirituality speciﬁc 
to their race. We are uncomfortable with Asians unless they correspond to the stereotypes 
we have created for them. 
There was a great deal of affection for Charlie Chan, the wise Chinese detective 
employed by the Honolulu Police Department (played ﬁrst by the Swedish-born Warner 
Oland and then by Sidney Toler, both in “yellowface”), who dispensed calm fortune-
cookie wisdom and always solved the crime. His sons, played by Keye Luke, Victor Sen 
Yung (both native Chinese) provided the comic foil. As Americanized second-generation 
types, they played the gap between expectation and reality for all it was worth. While the 
actors portraying Charlie Chan contrived Chinese accents, the sons (both of whom came 
to the U.S. as very small children) spoke English as a primary language and with a markedly 
urban discourse style (“Pop!”). In a similar way, the 1937 ﬁlm of Pearl S. Buck’s The Good 
Earth also used white actors to play the leads, to the satisfaction of reviewers who found 
that the main character met (stereotypical) expectations: “Physically, Muni becomes 
satisfactorily celestial, imbued with racial characteristics” (Variety, January 29, 1937). 
Female Asian stereotypes focus on submissiveness, beauty, a need for strong male 
direction and a talent for tragedy (the opera Madam Butterfly is perhaps the ultimate 
example of this stereotype). While Asian male stereotypes have evolved (over-achieving 
in education and business, whether the business be a greengrocer’s or computer chip 
research and development), female images seem to be more persistent. 
The stereotypes in ﬁlm linger, but there are other stereotypes that have evolved since 
World War II that are far more restrictive and damaging on a day-to-day basis. The most 
prevalent and deeply rooted Asian stereotype of all is encapsulated in a series of questions 
and statements often directed to Asians (Cargile 2010; Cheryan and Bodenhausen 2000; 
Kawai 2005; Le 2010; Lee 1994): 
Where are you from? 
Where are you REALLY from? 
But you speak English so well!

THE UNASSIMILABLE RACES 
Scholars and analysts see this as a symptom of a larger problem, often referred to as the 
perpetual foreigner syndrome: “We are ﬁguratively and even literally returned to Asia and 
rejected from America” (Wu 2002: 79). Wu is affronted by such casually racist and con-
descending remarks which imply “that I am not one of ‘us’ but one of ‘them’ . . . I am a 
visitor at best, an intruder at worst” (ibid.: 80). 
Our discomfort with those Asians we see as unable or unwilling to assimilate into Anglo 
society is balanced out and made tolerable by the contrasting stereotype, those model 
Asians who are unobtrusive and well behaved in their other-ness, who assimilate to the 
point that we can overlook (or at least, claim to overlook) issues of race and physical 
characteristics and language. 
Today the model minority is the “most inﬂuential and prevalent stereotype for Asian 
Americans” (Kawai 2005: 109). The concept was ﬁrst articulated in print in a 1966 New 
York Times Magazine story (“Success Story, Japanese Style”) and later in the same year, a 
‘’Success Story of One Minority in U.S.’’ about Chinese Americans (U.S. News and World 
Report). In both cases the immigrant group in question (Japanese, Chinese) were provided 
as examples of good immigrants, who obeyed the laws, respected the government’s 
authority, put great value on family ties and responsibilities, pursued education and 
believed in hard work as the primary route to success. The two articles celebrated Japanese 
and Chinese Americans as the model minority groups who had close family ties, were 
extremely serious about education, and were law-abiding (Kawai 2003; Park 2008b). Asian 
American had come to mean “exhibiting cultural values that are conducive to socio-
economic success” (Park 2008: 552). 
More than forty years later, the condescending tone of these pronouncements published 
in the early1960s is hard to overlook. In the jargon of the Transactional Analysis 
movement of the 1960s, this would be called a “cold fuzzy,” or something that sounds at 
ﬁrst like a compliment but is decidedly less (as in “you look great – for your age”). Another 
negative aspect of the model minority stereotype is the implied juxtaposition of good 
(Japanese or Chinese) with bad (all other minority and/or immigrant groups). In the late 
twentieth century, both those who supported afﬁrmative action and those who opposed 
it drew on the Asian-as-model-minority stereotype that set up a competition between 
Asians, African Americans, and Latinos/as (McGowan and Lindgren 2006). 
In his interviews with Asian American students, Park found that an individual can 
identify with the term “model minority” while still chafﬁng under its restrictions: 
Asian Americans cannot perform as “normal” students, cannot be countercultural, 
contentious, unconventional, or lead an independent lifestyle. The ramiﬁcations are 
not that the image itself is threatened but that the individual is somehow less 
authentically Asian American if he or she diverges from it. It is an identity imposed 
by others and places considerable constraints not only in the area of study one selects 
but the very trajectory of one’s work and contribution to society. 
(Park 2008: 552–553) 
Anglos often deny or minimize the negative effect of Asian stereotypes. This becomes 
clear if discriminatory behavior toward Asians is compared to other stigmatized groups. 
For example, on a website where theater professionals discuss their work, someone posts 
a question: 
Topic: Caucasian to Asian makeup tips? . . . Working on a production of “Thoroughly 
Modern Millie” where we have Caucasian actors playing Bun Foo and Ching Ho . . .

----- Page 314 (native) -----

289 
as far as makeup, we want it to look as authentic as possible, while exaggerating it 
enough for an extremely large venue. Any tips or ideas? Anyone have photo examples? 
The following hypothetical comparison paragraph is my composition: 
Caucasian to African American makeup tips? Working on a production of “Show 
Boat” where we have Caucasian actors playing African American stevedore Joe and 
his wife Queenie . . . as far as makeup, we want it to look as authentic as possible, 
while exaggerating it enough for an extremely large venue. Any tips or ideas? Anyone 
have photo examples? 
The wording here is not overtly racist, but its offhand, casual tone is almost as disturbing 
as slurs heard more commonly. It doesn’t occur to the writer that there might be some 
problem with yellowface (as discussed earlier in connection with ﬁlm representations of 
Asians).5 
Blackface was a theatrical practice in the late 1800s and into the twentieth century when 
Anglos performing in minstrel shows and vaudeville would appear as African American 
caricatures. To do this they used burnt cork or black greasepaint to change white faces to 
black faces. There were also actors who painted broad red lips around their mouths, 
outside the borders of their own lips. Later the red paint was dropped, but the space 
remained either ﬂesh-colored or painted white. Some of the most persistent and virulent 
African American stereotypes originated with Blackface performances. It is not hard 
to understand that today any theater person suggesting that an Anglo play an African 
American – and wear makeup as part of that costume – would meet with tremendous, 
nationwide backlash. It is hard to imagine anyone so uninformed that they would raise the 
possibility of Blackface in a current day, non-satirical production in a public forum. 
Yet here a number of people responded to a question about yellow face with suggestions 
that included using tape on the eyelids and heavy eye liner. In the ﬁrst half of the dis-
cussion, very few responses addressed the racist underpinnings of the question, and those 
few comments (“If we ignore the history behind ‘black face’, why is ‘Asian face’ less offen-
sive?” “Come back next year when you do Ragtime and need help turning white people 
black!” (ibid.)) are not responded to directly by the original writer until this exchange: 
This thread’s unbelievably racist. How about just have the actors AS THEY ARE. 
When non-Caucasian actors are cast in traditionally white roles they don’t get made 
up as white. Don’t you grasp what it is you’re actually suggesting? Creepy. 
To which the original writer responds: “You obviously failed to read my post.” 
At a later point the thread turns to a more thoughtful discussion of race and ethnicity 
in casting. This is just one of hundreds if not thousands of examples that are easily found 
on the internet, radio, television and in print. It is a particularly good example because it 
makes very clear how unaware Anglos are when it comes to racism toward Asians. Many 
will claim that the primary image for Asian Americans is thoroughly positive. 
The flip side to the model minority stereotype is an older and less ambivalent 
construction of Asians as the “Yellow Peril,” an image which arose in the mid- to late 
nineteenth-century xenophobia and racism, in response to increasing numbers of Asian 
immigrants. This duality – model minority and threat in one – is a common feature of 
racial stereotypes. Whether seen as models of successful assimilation or as yellow devils,

THE UNASSIMILABLE RACES 
Asians – both native to the U.S. and immigrants – are mocked and berated for their accents 
(real or imagined) and seen as perpetually foreign (Chou and Feagin 2008; Gee 2009; 
McGowan and Lindgren 2006). In extreme cases they are denied employment, or become 
the victims of violence (Chow 2001; Hall and Hwang 2001). 
For example, two Anglo autoworkers, angry because they were about to lose their jobs 
due to a downturn in the industry, picked a ﬁght with Vincent Chin, a stranger to them 
they had mistaken for Japanese. According to the police report, a bystander heard one of 
the two men of say to Chin, “It’s because of you little motherfuckers that we’re out of 
work.” He was beaten with a baseball bat and died of his injuries a few days later. 
As terrible as this crime was for Chin and his family, it got worse. The judge who heard 
the case allowed the attorneys to come to a settlement without hearing any witness 
testimony. The two men – who never served any jail sentence despite multiple attempts 
to try them – were given probation and a ﬁne of $3,000 plus court costs (Choy et al. 1990, 
documentary, Who Killed Vincent Chin?). Public criticism at the time compared this 
sentence to similar court cases in the age of Jim Crow in the Deep South. 
The outrage about such a sentence for a brutal, premeditated hate crime (a term not 
yet in use at the time) sparked a new wave of activism across the country and the formation 
of American Citizens for Justice (ACJ). This was the ﬁrst time that 
[People] who traced their ancestry to different countries in Asia and the Paciﬁc Islands 
crossed ethnic and socioeconomic lines to fight as a united group of Asian Pacific 
Americans. They were Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Filipino; they were waiters, 
lawyers, and grandmothers who were moved by the incident that heightened their 
awareness of discrimination and racism directed toward the APA community. 
(Yip 1997) 
The two young Anglo men who murdered Thien Minh Ly, a Vietnamese native and 
graduate of UCLA, were arrested when a letter written by one of them was given to the 
police. This small excerpt is a vivid display of matter-of-fact racism, but it is fairly calm 
compared to the rest of the letter: 
Oh I killed a jap a while ago I stabbed him to Death at Tustin High school I walked 
up to him Dominic was with me and I seen this guy Roller blading and I had a knife. 
We walk in the tennis court where he was I walked up to him. Dominic was right 
there I walked right up to him and he was scared I looked at him and said “Oh 
I thought I new you” and he got happy that he wasn’t gona get jumped. Then I hit 
him . . . 
Not all aggression is so overtly violent. More usually, those who speak English with an 
Asian accent are met with a combination of irritation, unease, distrust and condescension. 
One such situation was made public when Dell Computer put a new and unusual policy 
in place in response to customer complaints about dealing with Asian support staff on the 
telephone. A new level of paid customer service was introduced; for a fee, subscribers 
would be helped on the phone by native speakers of English from North America 
(Whoriskey 2008. See also Chapter 17 on linguistic proﬁling). 
There is also a large body of public commentary with no obvious racial or ethnic 
triggering event, much of which is extreme and virulent, which will be considered in the 
next section.

Mockery 
As discussed in earlier chapters, mockery can be an effective tool when the goal is sub-
ordination by means of trivialization. There are many examples of linguistic mocking on 
the internet targeting Latinos/as and African Americans (Calafell 2006; Chun 2004; Hill 
1995, 2008; Ronkin and Karn 1999). There are fewer sources of such material for Asians, 
but there are many day-to-day examples. Public mockery of Asian-accented English comes 
from politicians (as discussed earlier in this chapter), from talk-show hosts (Jay Leno seems 
to be particularly fond of pseudo-Asian accented English), newspapers (“We likee Hirally! 
She best quality!”), news commentators (Maloy 2009), lawyers (Soo 2003), and judges 
speaking to petitioners (Angulo 2008). It also comes from those who simply like to 
participate in discussions online. An example from the Urban Dictionary which was made 
on August 14, 2006 (when it was downloaded in October, 2010, there were 180 up votes, 
and 82 down): 
Ching chong bing bong: The language of those born to the Asian countries. It is 
the root of all evil and when heard for an excessive amount of time, causes one to 
vomit uncontrollably. Excuse me, I can’t understand your ching chong bing bong, please try 
English when you are in America. 
Taken at face value, this kind of statement – and there is a great deal of it – indicates that 
the stereotypes of Asian Americans are very narrow and persistent, and discrimination is 
broad and unapologetic. 
Certainly those who speak English with an Asian accent have the impression that they 
are not taken seriously, and that “native speakers deliberately chose not to understand 
them, and that some native speakers tended to ‘shut down’ or ‘close up’ when the L2 
learners started talking” (Derwing et al. 2002: 247). This correlates with other research 
that has established the ability of native English speakers to hallucinate an accent where 
none exists (as discussed in Chapter 9). 
To this last point must be added the odd case of not only hallucinating an accent, but 
mocking what has been hallucinated. A case in point is the way Senator Alfonse D’Amato 
mocked a prominent Asian-American High Court judge by quoting him using a stereo-
typical Asian accent (Henneberger 1995). The judge D’Amato was mocking is a native 
speaker of English, born in Los Angeles. 
The inappropriate nature of this behavior is clearer if you substitute a different public 
ﬁgure, one from a minority population that has its own variety of English, but who speaks 
*SAE natively. President Obama is one such person. If during a Senate session, a Senator 
mocked President Obama while employing features of AAVE – and employing them badly 
– there would be a very large (and deserved) backlash. Not because Obama isn’t a native 
speaker of AAVE, but because such an act lays open the speaker’s true feelings about that 
language and the people who speak it in a way that is difﬁcult to ignore or gloss over. 
The transmission and rationalization of racism 
When children play together, quite a lot of information about the world and the way it 
works passes from oldest to youngest in the form of chants, rhymes and games. In the

----- Page 317 (native) -----
292 
THE UNASSIMILABLE RACES 
seminal study of childhood games, folklorists Knapp and Knapp put this much more 
prosaically: 
We are so preoccupied with what we have to offer children that we overlook the 
education they can offer one another; yet, in the unsupervised nooks and crannies of 
their lives, where they perpetuate centuries-old folk traditions, children learn what 
no one can teach them. 
(Knapp and Knapp 1976: 9) 
Some of the things children teach each other include turn-taking, the negotiation of rules, 
the difference between cheating and testing the rules (ibid.: 31), how to claim prestige or 
power, and how to deny prestige and power to others. Chants and rhymes are also part of 
the process of learning to face fears and superstitions, and the acquisition of social skills 
such as accommodation and resistance. 
Knapp and Knapp contend that children’s lore helps them cope with the day-to-day in 
three ways: (1) they are comforted by the assurance that everybody has the same troubles; 
(2) they learn how to cope with what is frightening in the present by escaping into fantasy; 
and (3) most important in the context of this book, folklore provides a tightly controlled 
frame for the expression of hostility and frustration. In connection with this last point, 
children learn about how to repair misunderstandings, deny culpability, and apologize. It 
is in this last context that children experience and begin to understand racism and 
xenophobia. 
Collections of children’s rhymes, songs and games recorded by folklorists and anthro-
pologists between the mid-nineteenth and the mid-twentieth century contain many 
shocking examples of extreme, unapologetic racism, some of which promotes violence. 
The three groups targeted most often in the collected children’s lore are African 
Americans, Jews, and Asians. Here is an example of one version of a very widely known 
rhyme that has been in circulation since the early twentieth century (as I learned it growing 
up in 1960s Chicago): 
Ching chong Chinaman  
Sitting on a bench  
Trying to make a dollar  
Out of ﬁfty-ﬁve cents.  
He missed. He missed.  
He missed like THIS.  
There is some speculation that ching chong originated as an imitation of a dialect of Chinese 
as heard by native English speakers. That is a perfectly reasonable – but unveriﬁable – 
hypothesis. It is also true that between the years 1850 and 1950, major newspapers in New 
York, Chicago and Los Angeles reported legitimate (but not necessarily unbiased) stories 
about Chinese nationals or residents, and that Ching Chong appeared as one of many 
actual given names. Undoubtedly the overtly discriminatory epithet chink is derived from 
ching chong. It should also be noted that while these terms were ﬁrst coined in connection 
with Chinese immigrants and residents, they now are used more broadly in reference to 
anyone with an Asian appearance. 
These two syllables spoken together have a history and a signiﬁcance that evoke strong 
reactions from Asians:

----- Page 318 (native) -----
THE UNASSIMILABLE RACES 
293 
[Ching Chong] comes from an ugly place deep in this country’s history, when Chinese 
were viewed as strange interlopers, the “heathen Chinee,” an economic and social 
scourge. Those words once accompanied violence and lynchings. “Ching-Chong 
Chinaman” rhymes dating to the 19th century weren’t just schoolyard taunts. To be 
ignorant of that . . . doesn’t eliminate the history. 
Nor are schoolyard taunts harmless: 
“I would get ‘sighted’ – picked out – as the ‘chinky girl’ and those words would come 
out, then ﬁsts would hit me,” remembered Doris Owyang, the program manager for 
San Francisco State University’s Center for the Integration and Improvement of 
Journalism. Three years ago, a group of white teenagers attacked Asian-American 
youths while shouting imitation Chinese, a case that ended in felony and misdemeanor 
convictions. 
(Chung 2006) 
Chung’s article – and many others like it – were written in response to an exchange that 
took place on The View, a popular morning television talk show, on December 5, 2006. 
The panelists were discussing a guest from the previous taping who had, it seemed to 
them, showed up drunk for his televised interview. Rosie O’Donnell, a panel member, 
commented on the whole matter: 
The fact is that it’s news all over the world. That you know, you can imagine in China, 
it’s like: “Ching chong . . . ching chong. Danny DeVito, ching chong, chong, chong, 
chong. Drunk. ‘The View.’ Ching chong.” 
(The View, ABC, December 5, 2006) 
Objections from the Asian community followed immediately in the form of newspaper 
articles, letters to the editor, and television interviews and statements (Chung 2006). The 
complaints were unified in their shock and displeasure that O’Donnell would have 
used such blatant ethnic slurs, and demands for a public apology. Some Asian-Americans 
performed their disapproval; for example, ultra-conservative Filipina Michelle Malkin 
(infamous for her pro-government stance on the matter of the internment of Japanese-
Americans in World War II) posted a video on YouTube, as did younger Asians whose 
anger was just as potent.6 
Rosie O’Donnell, a comedian, actor and talk show host, is a prominent ﬁgure in the 
LGBT7 civil rights movement, someone who has publicly confronted others who make 
homophobic statements or gestures; thus, her reaction to the demand for an apology was 
perplexing to many who followed the incident. Rather than end the episode by apologizing 
directly and clearly, she embarked on a passive-aggressive non-apology apology. 
Apologizing-but-not-apologizing is a speech act that has been studied by linguists 
interested in pragmatics and political discourse strategies as well as by casual but insightful 
observers (Kampf 2009; McCall 2001; Robinson 2004). A few generalizations can be made 
about this kind of speech act: it is never neutral (that is, there is always an underlying power 
dynamic and conﬂict); the maintenance of “face” plays a role; the person apologizing is 
seeking a way to mollify – or at least to silence – the offended party while still minimizing 
his or her own responsibility:

----- Page 319 (native) -----
294 
THE UNASSIMILABLE RACES 
Indeed, the apologizer’s acknowledgment of a transgression is the most important 
feature for facilitating an understanding of the motive for apologizing or avoiding it. 
In addition to a clear acknowledgment of responsibility, an ideal apology should . . . 
be void of any other type of excuses and/or justiﬁcations. 
(Kampf 2009: 2258) 
I’m sorry, I just refuse to apologize 
It is common practice to apologize while maintaining that no offense was actually given, 
as happened in the O’Donnell case. The strategies for pulling off a non-apology are varied: 
1  
If in fact my words offended anyone, I regret that fact. This is a gambit to save face and 
throw doubt on the fact of the offense itself. Just beneath the surface is denial of having 
caused offense at all. 
2  
Express regret that a statement had an adverse effect on others or was perceived as 
offensive: I’m sorry that your feelings were hurt. This puts the onus on the person who 
was offended. One way to think about this: When I punched you in the face, it was not 
my intent to break your nose. Really. 
3  
Apologize for the style alone: I apologize for my abrupt tone. 
4  
Apologize for a speciﬁc and limited component of the offense while rejecting the bulk 
of it; I apologize for generalizing about Asians. It’s only the Japanese who are the true model 
minority. 
5  
Apologize using passive constructions and euphemisms to mitigate responsibility: my 
words were taken out of context (you deliberately misunderstood me); the situation was 
misinterpreted (the situation rather than the act itself); people have told me I was wrong to 
say it (that’s what people say, but I’m not buying it); and the classic: mistakes were made 
(but not by me). 
6 
Apologize while using gestures and facial expressions to undermine the sincerity of 
the words themselves. I’m sorry that you were [AIR QUOTES] offended. 
7 
Apologize while claiming authority to do so: I’m sorry if you were offended, but I’m a 
straightforward person, I call ’em like I see ’em. 
8  
Often a person will simply go on the offensive: Can’t you take a joke? or You’re the one 
who is racializing this discussion, not me or Wow, you are a drama queen, aren’t you? or 
How dare you say I’m prejudiced. I am the one being discriminated against. 
In the aftermath of the December 5, 2006 performance by O’Donnell, many of these 
strategies and tactics were employed by herself, her colleagues and her weblog visitors. 
Her exchanges with people who visit her weblog were particularly interesting, because it 
was her policy to respond brieﬂy to every comment visitors left.8 In that venue her “ching-
chong” joke came up repeatedly over a few weeks, with two kinds of audience comment: 
those who defended her performance and those who criticized her roundly and pursued 
the issue of an apology.9 
A short examination of the weblog comments and her responses provides insight into 
what seems to have been O’Donnell’s sometimes conflicted feelings about the whole 
incident. Please note that I have corrected typos but left abbreviations in common use 
across the web as they are used, and further, these are not all the comments, nor do they 
necessarily appear in this order. Read these with the strategies discussed above in mind.

(1) Rosie: for someone who comes off to be so sensitive and aware of lgbt issues, why 
did you think it was alright to mock Chinese people and the language on The View 
(re: danny devito: ching chong . . .)??? 
RO: it was not my intent to mock / just to say how odd it is that danny drunk was 
news / all over the world even in china / it was not meant to mock 
(2) Rosie, what made you think it was okay to make fun of the way Chinese people 
speak? 
RO: the joke was about the danny devito drunk news / making headlines all over the 
world including china / just comedy folks / no intent 2 harm / peace 
(3) JP writes: Hey Rosie, why aren’t you getting your head out your butt and be more 
sensitive to Asian-Americans. Don’t post this message and see how you are hiding 
your true facade. You suck and need to get off tv. 
RO: go fuck urself, jp 
(4) Leema writes: U r a great role model. I respect ur courage. I’d like 2 know what 
makes u imitate a foreign language as a joke. It’d be funny if u knew how 2 speak it, 
it sounds racist and ignorant, which u r not. 
RO: i am irish / i do an irish accent / make drunk jokes / stereotypes / this is comedy 
/ i do many accents / and probably will continue to / my mom in law impression 
offends some Southerners / what can u do / i come in peace 
(5) Chao writes: Rosie – I am very appalled at your comments on The View regarding 
Asian people. They were so insensitive and hurtful. How can you possibly explain this 
and what can you say to help heal my wounds? 
RO: sorry u were offended chao / it was not my intent 
(6) Beth writes: It’s so silly that Bill O’Reilly is having a segment on how you angered 
the Asians – you didn’t do anything at all – you were saying how silly it is that Devito 
became world news! Don’t listen to them! 
RO: i don’t 
(7) toni writes: Ro, I can not believe that the Chinese are mad at you about a JOKE!!! 
Oh My God, lighten up people. Bill O’Reilly even stood up for you tonight on “The 
Factor”! Calm down people it was just a joke! 
RO: go bill 
(8) Yves writes: Rosie –I don’t see the big deal about the Chinese routine. You’ve 
done English accents before on TV and the Brits didn’t get bent out of shape. They 
took it out of context and they need to chill. 
RO: the whole thing is odd 2 me 
(9) Max writes: I’m a hypersensitive politically correct leftist. I checked out YouTube 
to see what the fuss was about. Give me a break! You were speaking Gibberish to 
symbolize a language you didn’t know. So what?!

you use racist stereotyping? If what you say in the past is true, what you say in the 
unguarded is true – then I guess you are a racist 
RO: come on hirou gotta be kidding 
(11) Ben writes: If the joke were about fat people and instead went: “Fat people around 
the world heard it. They probably said, ‘Gobble gobble, munch munch, DeVito, 
drunk, munch view, gobble.’ Would it offend you?

In the December 14, 2006 airing of The View, O’Donnell addressed the issue directly. 
This apparently was very offensive to a lot of Asian people. So I asked Judy, who’s 
Asian and works here in our hair and makeup department. I said, “Was it offensive 
to you?” And she said, “Well, kinda. When I was a kid people did tease me by saying 
ching-chong.” So apparently “ching-chong,” unbeknownst to me, is a very offensive 
way to make fun, quote–unquote, or mock, Asian accents. Some people have told me 
it’s as bad as the n-word. I was like, really? I did not know that [. . . The joke was ]

never intended to hurt anyone, and I’m sorry for those people who felt hurt or were 
teased on the playground . . . there’s a good chance that I’ll do something like that 
again. 
(O’Donnell, The View, ABC, December 14, 2006) 
On the basis of the public record it seems that O’Donnell never issued a sincere first 
person, unqualiﬁed apology, one which might have gone like this: “I was wrong to use 
those words to imitate Chinese or Asian speakers, I understand now how offensive it was 
and it will not happen again. Please accept my sincere apology.” Quite the opposite, she 
gave notice that she was likely to repeat her performance. 
One of the points many critics raised had to do with O’Donnell’s advocacy for LGBT 
rights and protections. The assumption underlying these complaints seemed to be that 
those who advocate for one peripheralized group should do the same for other groups 
who are discriminated against. In fact, this is another example of the depth and breadth 
of language-focused discrimination and standard language ideology. Even the most liberal 
people will demonstrate what they believe to be their right: to use language as a tool to 
establish and re-establish social boundaries and privilege. 
If nothing else, this episode and others described here make clear how unaware – and 
unconcerned – most Americans are when Asians are the focus of discriminatory policies 
and practices. 
In the classroom 
In educational settings an unwillingness to engage in conversation with anyone who speaks 
with an Asian accent has been well documented. Such refusals could be due to simple 
laziness, disinterest, animosity, fear of being socially linked to foreigners, resentment, 
racism, ethnocentrism, or any combination of these. 
In my own experience teaching at the University of Michigan I considered this problem 
at length because it was one I saw personally on a regular basis. I decided to try a small 
experiment when I was teaching an introductory linguistics course to 250 undergraduates 
in lecture format. In teaching this course I worked with graduate student teaching assistants 
who took over discussion sections, common practice at almost all universities. A number 
of my TAs were Asian non-native speakers of English who had come to the States to work 
on advanced degrees in linguistics. They had accents, but their English was ﬂuent and 
colloquial and each one of them had been accepted into the graduate program. 
The ﬁrst time I taught this class, I had multiple emails and phone calls after the ﬁrst 
discussion section. Students complained about having a TA who spoke with an accent; 
they couldn’t understand the TA and wanted to be moved to another section. Sometimes 
these complaints were very harsh and accusatory in tone, as if by being assigned to an 
Asian teaching assistant, they were being denied some basic right. Resolving these conﬂicts 
required that I meet with each of these students individually to discuss the actual nature 
of their worries, and to suggest ways to ameliorate what they perceived as an irresolvable 
conﬂict. Not one of these students ever considered that they might have some work to do 
in order to achieve successful communication; in every case, it was seen as the TA’s 
responsibility alone. 
The next time I taught this course, I spent half an hour in the ﬁrst lecture talking about 
accents in general and foreign accents in particular and about common-sense ways to

----- Page 323 (native) -----
298 
THE UNASSIMILABLE RACES 
resolve difﬁculties – if difﬁculties ever arose. These included asking for clariﬁcation in a 
straightforward but polite way, requesting that a word or sentence be written on the board, 
along with the beneﬁts of patience, open-mindedness and empathy for those who were 
now in a situation that the undergraduates might someday be in themselves, if they were 
lucky enough to study abroad. That year I had two disgruntled undergraduates asking to 
be removed from a discussion section led by a native Japanese speaker, and both those 
individuals had missed the ﬁrst lecture. 
This is, of course, only anecdotal, but others have spent years researching the elements 
that cause communication difﬁculties between ESL learners and native speakers, from 
phonetics to ideology. In a particularly insightful study, Derwing, Rossiter and Munro set 
out to “determine whether native speakers’ comprehension of accented speech can be 
enhanced through instruction. The experiment involved both cross-cultural content and 
explicit instruction in the characteristics of a particular accent” (Derwing et al. 2002). The 
study required pre-testing of comprehension after listening to Vietnamese accented 
recordings, accent lessons, cross-cultural communication lessons, and post-comprehension 
tests. 
The students, all enrolled in a class in the social work program, were divided at random 
into three groups: 
1 
The Accent Instruction group, which received instruction in the nature and charac-
teristics of English spoken with a Vietnamese accent in addition to cross-cultural 
training by means of readings and conversations tied to the curriculum, recorded by 
the Vietnamese speakers. 
2 
The Familiarity group did not receive instruction on the way Vietnamese inﬂuences 
English language learning, but they did get the cross-cultural communication 
instruction, which included listening to the content-related recordings made by the 
Vietnamese participants. 
3 
The Control group received neither type of training, and concentrated on the course 
material alone. 
The experiment itself took eight weeks and consisted of the pre-test, the in-class 
instruction sessions, and the post-test. In the testing, students listened to a recording of 
Vietnamese speakers talking in English about a topic relevant to the coursework; they 
answered comprehension questions and transcribed sentences. Finally, they ﬁlled out a 
questionnaire on their attitudes and perceptions about the material and presentation. 
The only difference between the Accent Instruction and Familiarity groups was the fact 
that the former got additional instruction in the way Vietnamese inﬂuenced pronunciation 
of English.10 
On the basis of this experiment, there is some reason to believe that anti-Asian sentiment 
and language-focused discrimination are not immutable. Some proportion of individuals 
reject Asians and communication with Asians out of unfamiliarity; an effort to replace 
stereotype with real interpersonal experience will bear fruit. In this particular situation, 
the students were not given a choice of which group to join; those who found themselves 
in the Accent Instruction or the Familiarity groups were required to participate in the 
exercises which by their nature challenged stereotypical expectations. 
Table 15.2 summarizes this study. Given a choice, would students participate in this 
kind of instruction? Should they be compelled to participate? What would be gained or 
lost by instituting such policies?

False speakers of language 
In Chang-Rae Lee’s critically acclaimed 1995 novel, Native Speaker, a Korean-American 
narrator called Henry Park tells the story of how he came to fall in love with his wife, an 
American who is of interest to him not just as a woman, but because as a speech pathologist 
she works with children who are non-native speakers of English. 
“People like me are always thinking about still having an accent,” he tells her in their 
ﬁrst discussion. What he does not say, but which is clear to the character from real-life 
experiences is that people “like” himself must always be thinking about having an accent, 
because that is what is expected of them: to be different, and to externalize that difference 
with language. Caught between his own and public expectations, Park can please no one. 
When his wife leaves to travel without him, and perhaps forever, her note of explanation 
is a simple list of descriptors for him, which include: 
illegal alien 
emotional alien 
Yellow peril: neo-American 
Later he ﬁnds another scrap of paper with a deﬁnition of himself on it that she could not 
quite include on the ﬁnal list: False speaker of language.

THE UNASSIMILABLE RACES 
Like African Americans, Asian Americans have more and more difﬁcult hurdles to leap 
before they can transcend stereotype and be accepted as individuals. Accent, when it serves 
as a marker of race, takes on special power and significance. For many in the African 
American community there is little resistance to the language subordination process, in 
part because the implied promises of linguistic assimilation – while obviously overstated 
– are nevertheless seductive, precisely because the threats are very real. 
The idea of perfect English, of belonging absolutely to the mainstream culture of choice, 
is one that is hard to resist for Asian Americans as well. 
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
Consider the series of court rulings beginning in 1883 that led to the shutdown of all 
immigration from China for about sixty years. Look also at the related rulings that made 
it illegal to grant Asians naturalized citizenship. In that broader context, read the story of 
Bhagat Singh Thind, who came to the U.S. in 1917. What were the long-range 
repercussions of the Supreme Court decision that sent him back to Punjab? In linguistic 
terms, how factual was the Court’s definition of Indo-European? The website: 
http://goo.gl/4wKkS. 
Look closely at Table 15.2 adapted from the Derwing et al. (2002) experiment. 
What conclusions can you draw from these ﬁgures? How do the three control groups 
compare to each other? Consider differences between the first and second groups, 
and then compare them to the third group. On this evidence alone, what measures 
seemed to be most effective in alleviating communication stumbling blocks? Argue 
for or against the proposition that all first year college students should be required 
to participate in an orientation session that addresses communication issues such as 
these. 
In 2005, a student of Asian heritage applied to Princeton. He had an excellent academic 
history and hit all the usual marks for admission, but he was not admitted. He enrolled at 
Yale, and shortly thereafter ﬁled a lawsuit against Princeton for discrimination on the basis 
of national origin. In the following spring, a column appeared in The Daily Princetonian, 
the campus newspaper. A short excerpt: 
Hi Princeton! Remember me? I so good at math and science. Perfect 2400 SAT 
score. Ring bells? Just in case, let me refresh your memories. I the super smart 
Asian. Princeton the super dumb college, not accept me. 
What is the purpose of writing this in what is supposed to be the plaintiff’s own language? 
What underlying beliefs and ideologies might be informing it? 
How aware were you, before reading this chapter, of how offensive “ching-chong” is as 
an ethnic slur. How did you react to this information? If you felt any irritation, can you get 
to the bottom of that, and ﬁgure out where it comes from? If you are Asian, what are your 
experiences with this term? Have you ever talked to non-Asians about the impact this 
term has? Why or why not?

Moral panic in Oakland 
Moral panics are about locating evildoers, establishing the poisonous inﬂuence and 
iniquity of their actions, and rectifying the damage they’ve inﬂicted on the rest of us. 
The skeptic is challenged to understand what moral panics tell us about the inner 
workings of the society in which we live. 
Goode (2008: 39) 
How to build a moral panic 
Moral panic is a key concept in sociology, media and communication studies, where it is 
used to describe a certain kind of group or communal behavior. In the simplest terms, a 
moral panic starts when a community of people become aware of an event or person or 
group which may pose a threat to societal values and interests (Cohen 2002 [1972]; 
Critcher 2006; Goode and Ben-Yehuda 2009). Individuals who take up the cause – agents 
or actors who accelerate the process – are referred to as moral entrepreneurs or crusaders. 
Agents must be in a strong position socially to generate public awareness and to focus that 
awareness on a scapegoat or “folk devil.” Institutions can also act as moral entrepreneurs, 
so that the information media, entertainment media, schools, politicians and corporations 
(some or all of these) may be involved in the birth, acceleration and lifespan of a moral 
panic.1 
It is crucial to remember that the object at the center of any panic is standing in for 
some larger social conﬂict which may be too controversial to raise directly.2 One example 
of a recurring panic here in the U.S. has to do with dog breeds that are considered aggres-
sive. For example, in the 1970s many communities banned Doberman pinschers, and more 
recently pit bull terriers have caused panics. 
The event or events that trigger a panic may have been truly newsworthy and cause for 
increased concern, but the discussion quickly overruns the boundaries of the specific 
incident spirals upward. 
Moral panics then, are those processes whereby members of a society and culture 
become “morally sensitized” to the challenges and menace posed to “their” accepted 
values and ways of life, by the activities of groups defined as deviant. The process 
underscores the importance of the mass media in providing, maintaining and “polic-
ing” the available frameworks and deﬁnitions of deviance, which structure both public 
awareness of, and attitudes towards, social problems. 
(O’Sullivan 1994: 186)

MORAL PANIC IN OAKLAND 
Portrait of a folk devil 
In the case of pit bull panics in the U.S., moral entrepreneurs never talked speciﬁcally 
about the underlying conﬂict, but it was immediately recognizable once articulated. Pit 
bulls are associated with a particular stereotype: working-class males of a lower socio-
economic class who are prone to excessive and mindless violence, criminal tendencies, 
drug and alcohol abuse, and disregard or contempt for the common good due to a lack of 
human empathy (Gladwell 2006). This lack of empathy has been called “social alexithymia” 
and is found in many kinds of racist discourse (Hill 2008: 96). The assumption is this: Just 
as there is no hope of reasoning with an abused, out of control pit bull, there is no hope 
of appealing to the better nature of the men who own them. Using this example, we can 
trace the stages of a moral panic. 
Ten simple steps to a moral panic 
The elements of a moral panic do not follow one after the other in lock-step. There will 
be some variation in tone and speed of the acceleration, and on occasion a moral panic 
sputters and stalls in an early stage. The example here is meant to be representative of the 
steps in a full-ﬂedged moral panic.

The cycle dies down, the media steps back and the panic fades quite quickly. Because the 
underlying conflict has not been resolved, the issue waits for a triggering event to 
resurface.3 
African American English in context 
In a previous chapter we looked at AAVE from a number of directions. Beyond issues of 
phonology, morphology, syntax and rhetorical style, we compared definitions and

----- Page 331 (native) -----
306 
MORAL PANIC IN OAKLAND 
theorized about what the differences in those definitions meant. We looked at racism, 
overt and covert, as it surfaces in all age groups, ethnicities, races and socioeconomic 
groups. We considered the way AAVE is subordinated, and how those who subordinate 
rationalize their actions by assumption of authority and reference to language mythology. 
The issue of linguistic insecurity was raised, and countered by the acknowledgement that 
AAVE persists and will continue to persevere because it ﬁlls a need. 
With this background information, we turn to the events of late 1996 and early 1997 
referred to as the Oakland Ebonics Controversy, a moral panic of tremendous proportions 
and repercussions. 
The setting4 
Oakland, California, is a large port city on the East Bay in the San Francisco area. It has 
an estimated 2008 population of 404,155 with a population density of 7,298.8 persons per 
square mile (Figure 16.1). Oakland is a very diverse city, with an Anglo population of less 
than 40 percent and large African American, Latino and Asian communities. 
Lopez (September 2001) reports that in the East Bay area overall, those under age 18 
are more racially and ethnically diverse than the population as a whole. A larger percentage 
of the under-18 group self-identify as more than one race. From the available ﬁgures it 
could be posited that some 30 percent of the school-aged children in Oakland are AAVE 
speakers, while another 20 percent may speak a language other than English at home 
(Figure 16.2).5 
The cost of living in Oakland is well above national averages. A person moving from 
Chicago to Oakland would pay approximately 11 percent more for groceries, 47 percent 
more for housing, 6 percent more on healthcare, while the cost of utilities will go down 
by about 20 percent. This will have something to do with the severity of Chicago’s winters 
and the cost of heating fuel (CNNMoney.com March 2009). At the same time, 26.6 
percent of Oaklanders under the age of 18 live below the poverty line (Figure 16.3).

MORAL PANIC IN OAKLAND 
It is no surprise that there is inequality in school funding, nor is it difﬁcult to trace the 
connection: richer districts provide more of everything, from audiovisual equipment to 
classroom assistants, while higher salaries make it possible to hire the best teachers 
In Oakland, only 6.5 percent of the school population is Anglo, while Latinos and 
African Americans together make up about 70 percent of the total. In addition, a full 
30.6 percent of Oakland’s school population needs instruction in English as a second 
language. 
If 30 percent of Oakland’s students come to school without sufﬁcient English skills, and 
another approximate 30 percent speak AAVE as a home language, the school district will 
require extra resources to provide the necessary instruction. Even with so many additional 
challenges, Oakland is underfunded in comparison to neighboring Pleasanton, where only 
5.7 percent of the students come to school as native speakers of a language other than 
English. 
The triggering event 
A few things about the Oakland school district in 1996 which are generally agreed upon: 
The children in the district, most especially the African American children, were not 
doing well academically, and had not been doing well for a very long time. 
This failure to thrive was due at least in part to the fact that African American children 
came to school speaking a variety of English that (1) differs significantly from the 
academic/school English they were expected to use; and (2) was highly stigmatized. 
Teachers had not yet found a methodology that addressed these complex issues. 
The teachers and staff were looking for a way to make schooling relevant and reward-
ing for these children. 
The School Board recognized that it would take a great deal of funding to ﬁnd appro-
priate ways to proceed and turn this situation around. 
There was no money for such a project; there was barely enough money to keep the 
classrooms staffed and provide textbooks. 
In summary, if AAVE speakers were to succeed in school, two things had to happen: 
funding needed to become available, and they had to ﬁnd a way to engage the children in 
the possibility of success. At the same time, the staff and school board were very much 
aware that there was money available for teaching English to children who came to school 
speaking another language entirely, as they would cite in their resolution: 
Whereas, the Federal Bilingual Education Act (20 USC 1402 et seq.) mandates that 
local educational agencies “build their capacities to establish, implement and sustain 
programs of instruction for children and youth of limited English proﬁciency.” 
At this point, a well-established theory was raised: the best way to introduce children to 
the idea of *SAE is to use the home language as a conduit.6 So why not propose that AAVE 
be recognized as a language independent of English? If this approach worked, there would 
be more money to get things done, and they would have the beginnings of a program that 
valued AAVE as a fully functional human language. This would be a good ﬁrst step toward 
drawing disenfranchised children back into the classroom.

The School Board wrote a proposal which said, in essence: We are failing in our pri-
marily goal to teach AAVE-speaking children *SAE. They are resistant for a lot of complex 
reasons, and nothing we have tried so far has been successful. We have reason to believe 
that if we approach this from their perspective things will improve. If we start with what 
the children know, with the home language, they will understand that we’re not trying to 
take anything away from them. They’ll begin to expand their skills until the point they 
can code-switch between AAVE and *SAE according to situational factors. 
This is what the School Board was saying, but they didn’t put it this way. Note that 
their position is very conservative and traditional. All parties agree that schoolchildren 
must learn *SAE because the command of that language is crucial to success. No one raises 
the issue of the racism inherent to this linguistic separate-but-equal approach. The Anglo 
world is saying: you must assimilate linguistically, or we will systematically shut you out. 
Fair warning: learn our language, be like us, or we will discriminate against you. 
This ideology is so deeply rooted that the lack of logic, the incongruity is left to stand 
unchallenged. The Oakland School Board did not question this status quo; they afﬁrmed 
their commitment to it without hesitation. But there was an element of anger – certainly 
well placed, but counterproductive in its timing – in the way they worded their afﬁrmation 
and their resolution and in the way they described AAVE. Unfortunately the approach 
they took hindered rather than helped their cause. 
Linguist Geoff Nunberg (1997) put it quite bluntly: “The language of the board’s 
declaration seemed calculated to play to all the worst stereotypes of education jargon and 
afrocentric twaddle.” 
A basic tenet of persuasive writing is to never give detractors an inaccuracy to focus on, 
because they will use it to distract away from the real issue. In this case, detractors latched 
onto poor wording and inaccuracies and yanked very, very hard. The original version of 
the resolution was made public on December 18, 1996. Despite its ﬂaws, the ﬁrst media 
reports were fairly even-handed, for example, this opening from The San Francisco Chronicle 
dated December 19, 1996: 
The Oakland school board approved a landmark policy last night that recognizes 
Ebonics, or Black English, as a primary language of its African American students . . . 
The district’s resolution, passed unanimously, declares that all teachers in the Oakland 
Uniﬁed School District should be trained to respect the Ebonics language of their 
students as distinct from standard American English – not a dialect that is “wrong.” 
There is no mention here of “teaching AAVE” to the students, as would be reported later, 
even in the same paper. Nor is there any implication that *SAE was to be abandoned or 
replaced. And still, despite reasonable reports in the immediate aftermath of the resolution, 
the media coverage soon slipped into the realm of language mythology, and whatever good 
might have come from the original proposal was a lost cause. 
Linguists have spent a lot of time looking at the original proposal, analyzing problem 
areas and addressing generalizations or factual errors step by step, documenting everything 
along the way. This is a reasonable and useful thing for linguists to do, but in the tradition 
of all such situations, the carefully researched material made available to the public was 
largely ignored or, in some cases, mocked. 
The important point is this: in our eagerness to set the record straight on matters of 
linguistic science, we missed the larger, far more important underlying conflict. We

addressed the symptoms rather than the disease. This is where the language subordination 
model might be able to shed some light on how the media ﬁrestorm came to be. 
This sentence occurs early in the resolution: 
[Scholarly] studies have also demonstrated that African language systems are 
genetically-based and not a dialect of English.7 
The annual meeting of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) happened to come at the 
height of the Oakland controversy. During that meeting a response was drafted, the intent 
of which was to highlight what was factually accurate in the proposal while clarifying other 
points: 
What is important from a linguistic and educational point of view is not whether 
AAVE is called a “language” or a “dialect” but rather that its systematicity be recog-
nized. 
The phrase “African Language Systems are genetically-based” was another example of 
poor wording that distracted from the key issues. Shortly after the resolution was made 
public, the board issued a clariﬁcation: they had used “genetically-based” in the sense of 
“originate in.” But the damage was already done, as some commentators chose to focus 
on other readings of “genetic.” 
“Black students are genetically predisposed to speaking an inferior style of English.” 
What would happen if a white conservative said that? 
(Rush Limbaugh, On Ebonics, The Rush Limbaugh Show, December 22, 1996) 
The term “genetic” is used in comparative and historical linguistics in the study of inter-
relatedness of language families over time and space. In that context, you might say that 
Latin and Italian are genetically related. This concept is not widely understood outside 
linguistic circles, where “genetics” is associated with highly controversial matters such as 
innate intelligence, DNA research and manipulation, stem cell research among others. 
See “Last Train to Oakland,” below, for an example of a public reaction to the use of 
genetic linking. 
Finally, the board set about authenticating their claims by drawing on what they referred 
to as “scholarly studies.” This could be interpreted as an attempt to reach over the heads 
of potential detractors by establishing a link to academia and thereby claiming authenticity 
in a way that could be challenged on facts. If in fact the Board had consulted with linguists 
about the wording of the resolution, this appearance of falsely claiming authenticity could 
have been avoided, but they chose not to. 
Thus far we have the inferred claims from the resolution: 
Our language is fully grammatical within itself; it is distinct and it links us to our 
African origins in a way we celebrate. 
Our children have suffered educational malpractice because others refuse to recognize 
or accept our allegiance to ourselves and our communities (Baugh 1999). 
We can prove it; we have academics and scholars to back us up. 
Thus the stage was set for a panic of large proportions.

The panic cycle in Oakland 
The following collection of media quotes and snippets originates from more than two 
thousand items resulting from a database search for the word Ebonics occurring in a 
headline or lead paragraph between November 1996 and 2010. Included are news reports, 
editorials and letters to the editor from newspapers, and news and commentary from the 
broadcast media. 
Representative selections have been divided into rough categories that correspond with 
the hypothetical example provided above. As you read, pay attention to the shift in tone 
from neutral to hostile by keeping track of phrasing, descriptive terms, punctuation, and 
the evolution escalation of false or distorted reporting of facts. For example, consider the 
word primary in the extract from the December 20, 1996 issue of The Chattanooga Times. 
How might that be interpreted? Is it meant to be incendiary? 
Some of the examples are far less aggressive than others; some are merely very subtle. 
Where others have researched a particular statement or issue, that work is cited. 
Something unsettling or disturbing or frightening happens; the media focus on the 
event in the course of their usual news cycle. There is signiﬁcant reader or viewer 
response and interest; the cycle ramps up:

rubbish. The original resolution was so poorly drafted that I am minded to venture

by the media, politicians, and sometimes those with a commercial interest in the 
outcome:

2  The vagary of the Oakland, Calif., political hierarchy to propose that (presumed) 
mature, college-educated adults stoop to the vacuous mentality of a jive-talking, 
callow, maligned faction of society is the ultimate level of lunacy and perversity 
becoming the daily norm of this drug-crazed mass of inhumanity cavalierly referred 
to as the human race. Are the politicians in Oakland really concerned with improving 
education, or are they looking to establish another bureaucratic program to help fulﬁll 
their personal agendas of nepotism? Their political prescription (Ebonics) to this 
“cultural cancer” is analogous to the medical community’s covetous approach to the 
spectrum of medical maladies prevalent in this country – treating the symptom rather 
than the cause. Buffalo News, 1/27/1997. 
3  The Ku Klux Klan could not have come up with a better plan to impede the academic 
progress of young black children than the idea of teaching Ebonics as a separate 
language. Crain’s Chicago Business, 1/27/1997. 
4  The “Ebonics’ Fraud. If the people who have been promoting “Ebonics” with a 
straight face have any sense of humor, they surely are splitting their sides over the

is those black folks in Oakland are special, then how do we treat the Caribbean people?

6  EBONICS IS BLACK-ON-BLACK CRIME. So the Oakland Board of (mis) 
Education has decided to drop any suggestion that Ebonics is genetically based and 
that students should be taught in both Ebonics and standard English. Well, too 
late. The damage has already been done. Not since “Amos ’n’ Andy” and Mammy 
from “Gone With the Wind” has black America had to withstand such an assault 
on its collective image. This is black-on-black crime. Daily News, New York, 
1/17/1997. 
7  When the Oakland, Calif. Uniﬁed School District announced last year that it would 
adopt Ebonics – also called “Black-English” – as a teaching tool, a hue and cry arose 
throughout the land. Educators nationwide denounced the district for “legitimizing” 
a form of communication believed to be inferior to standard English, they raged. Tulsa 
World, 5/28/1997. 
Criticism accelerates to mockery: 
1  [Letter] I enjoyed the politically incorrect editorial cartoon comparing “Ebonics” 
with “Bubbonics” on Dec. 22. The Herald Sun, 12/29/1996. 
2  LET us not misunderstand the Oakland School Board’s intentions regarding 
“Ebonics,” the new word for the way black people talk. A construction of “ebony” 
and “phonics,” Ebonics is a bogus word – appropriately, I suppose, since the concept 
of “black English” is, too. The Houston Chronicle, 12/29/1996. 
3  I, too, have been looking for examples [of Ebonics], but the half-dozen or so 
newspapers I read regularly have given us very little in the way of genuine Ebonics. 
The best example I found was on the Internet. English: Toys R Us. Ebonics: We Be 
Toys. I like the Ebonics version better. Mike Royko, syndicated newspaper column, 
12/29/1996. 
4  At the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, an African American student gets an email 
entitled “Ebonic Loan Application.” The fake document was packed with stereotyped 
and racist images; for example, under “place of birth” were the following choices: 
charity hospital, free public hospital, cotton patch, back alley, zoo. 
Reactions and suggested remedies are disproportionate, with long-term, widespread 
and in extreme cases, destructive results. Actual resolutions sometimes result in a 
change in the law, one designed to further penalize the deviants and put more 
stringent controls in place: 
1  Georgia Senate rejects Ebonics for curriculum. Don’t know much about science 
books. Don’t know much about the French I took . . . Georgia lawmakers do know 
one thing – nobody be teaching Ebonics in state classrooms. A Senate committee has 
approved a bill prohibiting the controversial topic. The full Senate and the House 
will consider it later. The Chattanooga Times, February 13, 1997.

6  Last Train from Oakland. Oakland’s attempt to link genes and language was both 
racist and idiotic. Yesterday’s Senate hearing underscored the plan’s weaknesses, and 
brought the city’s superintendent under heavy attack. Outraged by the city’s proposal, 
one Congressman even suggested restricting Federal aid to the Oakland district. The 
New York Times, 1/24/1997. 
Postscript: Institutionalized mockery 
On October 9, 1998, a distinctive quarter page advertisement appeared in The New York 
Times. In it, an African American ﬁgure reminiscent of Martin Luther King, Jr. stands 
with his back turned to a bold proclamation in white print: “I HAS A DREAM.” The ad 
makes its case by appealing directly to African Americans: 
By now, you’ve probably heard about Ebonics (aka, Black English). And if you think 
it’s become a controversy because white America doesn’t want us messing with their 
precious language, don’t. White America couldn’t care less what we do to segregate 
ourselves. The fact is language is power. And we can’t take that power away from our 
children with Ebonics. 
(The National Head Start Association) 
The National Head Start Association (NHSA) is a private, not-for-profit membership 
organization representing some two thousand federally funded Head Start programs across 
the country. These educational programs address the needs of poor children to age 5. 
The message underwritten by NHSA is quite clear: to succeed, the African American 
community must assimilate linguistically. To maintain allegiance to home and community 
by linguistic means is to embrace poverty, ignorance, and prejudice. The authorities called 
upon to give credence to this message are the men who gave their lives for equal rights. 
Here, Ebonics is not a fully functioning variety of English, the symbol of solidarity and 
allegiance, but a disaster for the African American community. 
What is not generally known about this ad is that it was not conceptualized or written 
by the NHSA: it was the product of a collaboration between a group called Atlanta’s Black 
Professionals and three prominent ad agencies. The ad won the 1998 Grand Prize of 
the annual Athena Award offered by the Newspaper Association of America; The New York 
Times ran it free, as a public service announcement.8 According to executives at the ad 
agencies, the advertisement was popular when it ﬁrst ran in Atlanta and was requested by 
schools from Miami to Richmond.9

It is clear that this advertisement follows directly from the national debate on the 
Oakland Ebonics controversy. What is unclear – and the far more important question – 
is this: How did we come to this place where successful African American professionals, 
a national education organization and the most prominent daily newspaper not only 
collaborate to disseminate such divisive and exclusionary rhetoric, but award each other 
for it? Does an organization dedicated to the education of poor children really intend to 
advocate that we turn our backs on speakers who cannot or will not assimilate to corporate 
conceptions of “good” English? And perhaps most difﬁcult: what are linguists, parents 
and teachers who are dedicated to the education of all children to do in the face of such 
beliefs and tactics? 
Speaking up 
There were a number of media reports on the Oakland controversy that were particularly 
interesting for unusual perspectives, observations, or negative slant and factual inaccu-
racies. Some – but not all – of the negative or misleading articles appeared in high proﬁle 
conservative publications where the Oakland resolution was treated “as just one more 
multiculturalist scam” (Nunberg 1997).

Perhaps the best popular illustration of how a moral panic originates is found in The 
Music Man, a musical comedy that ﬁrst appeared on stage and later, on ﬁlm. A con man 
comes to small town Iowa; his ﬁrst step is to engage the trust of the community. Clips 
of this small segment can be found on YouTube (search “The Music Man” and “Ya Got 
Trouble” together). This is in fact a comedy, but it does a good job of demonstrating the 
whole process in a short time. Have a look at it and decide who Harold Hill is: moral 
entrepreneur or devil?

MORAL PANIC IN OAKLAND 
Select two or three clips provided in the case study and do a close reading and analysis. 
How do they (or don’t they) ﬁt into the language subordination model? 
In his article about his own involvement in the Oakland controversy, John Rickford talks 
a little about how linguists experienced personal fallout from the public: 
One thing that I naively did not expect was the subtle and not-so-subtle nastiness 
that issues of language can elicit from the public. I encountered this in the 
occasionally severe distortions of information which I had shared with reporters 
in good faith, and in the “hate mail” which my quoted remarks in the press elicited. 
One example of distortive reporting was Jacob Heilbrunn’s Ebonics article in the 
January 20, 1997 issue of The New Republic, to which I responded with a letter 
in the March 3, 1997 issue. One example of the hate mail was a postcard I 
received addressed to “John Rickford, Linguistics Professor (God Help Us All)” 
which included, alongside a newspaper report of my remarks at the 1997 LSA 
meeting, the comment: “It’s just amazing how much crap you so-called ‘scholars’ 
can pour and get away with. Can you wonder, John Boy, why the general public 
does not trust either educators, judges or politicians? As a brother might say, 
‘Ee Bonic be a bunch a booshit man, but it get de muny offa de White man. He 
be a sucka.’” Geoff Pullum also got hate mail for his Nature piece, as did Rosina 
Lippi-Green for her New York Times letter to the editor in December 1996. It 
comes with the territory. 
(Rickford 1999) 
Below is the letter mentioned in Rickford’s article, which I wrote to The New York Times 
after they published an editorial on the Oakland controversy. Following that are partial 
transcripts of two of the many letters I received through the mail. Questions for discussion 
follow. 
December 26, 1996 
To the Editor: 
In your Dec. 24 editorial ‘’Linguistic Confusion’’ you demonstrate considerable 
confusion of your own. 
The body of research on the history of that variety of American English called 
Black English or African American Vernacular English is anything but “dubious.” 
Because the school board in Oakland, Calif., prefers the term “ebonics” does 
not change the well-documented body of empirical, quantitative socio-linguistics 
that underlies what we know about the history and structure of that language. A 
more thorough examination of the topic would have provided you with input from 
linguists who could make the facts available to you. 
This is yet another example of the media’s biased reporting on language issues, 
in its self-appointed role as arbiter of a spoken “standard” language – a mythical 
beast you will never deﬁne with any clarity because it does not exist. 
Discrimination on the basis of language variation linked to race, national origin 
and economics exists not because the language is worthless or less than

functional, but because newspapers and other voices of authority insist that such 
discrimination is right and because we have been pushing that message for so 
long that most people no longer think to examine the false logic and spurious 
common-sense arguments. 
You and other papers have printed strong criticism of the Oakland board’s action 
by prominent and intellectual African Americans, but you have not sought out 
those who would speak rationally to the other side of this issue. There are 
interviews with Maya Angelou but none with the Nobel Prize winner Toni 
Morrison. The Rev. Jesse Jackson has drowned out James Baldwin’s famous 
1979 editorial “If Black English Isn’t a Language, Then Tell Me, What Is?” 
If you cannot look to your own archives, go to the major research universities in 
this country where African American and other linguists have produced a 
signiﬁcant body of work that might have given you some facts to work with. I 
suggest you start with the linguists John Rickford, John Baugh and Geneva 
Smitherman.

Responses sent through the mail to me, excerpted: 
You should be ashamed of yourself. You know better. You SHOULD know better. 
Did you get where you are today talking Black? 
I agree with you that we need to be more open minded about language. What I 
wish is that Pig Latin would be accepted. It ﬁts right in there with Ebonics. 
What assumptions are the letter writers working with? Why might they have come to 
such conclusions? What are the primary emotions that come across? 
Notes 
1  Moral panics have been documented as far back as antiquity. More recent examples 
include the Salem Witch Trials, the McCarthy hearings, Satanic Ritual Abuse in the 
1980s and the Terry Schiavo case, in which family members disagreed on whether or 
not to discontinue life support for a woman in a vegetative coma. 
2  In Verbal Hygiene Cameron looks closely at moral panics in England, from dog attacks 
to The Great Grammar Controversy. 
3  Frankfurter’s Evil Incarnate: Rumors of Demonic Conspiracy and Satanic Abuse in History 
(2006) takes as a thesis that Satanic ritual abuse stories surface again and again over 
time because they serve an important function. In a community where individuals, 
groups or institutions are leaning toward dissent, a moral panic provides an excuse to 
persecute or root out the non-compliant.

Linguistic profiling and fair housing 
Douglas Massey, who has conducted extensive research on patterns of racial segre-
gation, has noted that America’s large urban areas remain only slightly less segregated than 
South Africa during apartheid. Today, 41 percent of Black Americans live in neighbor-
hoods that are described as hyper-segregated, that is, in all Black high-density 
neighborhoods near other all-Black neighborhoods. Another 18 percent of African 
Americans also live in conditions of high segregation. 
“No Home for the Holidays,” National Fair Housing Alliance, 
December 2005 (emphasis added) 
In the period following World War II, one of the most pressing problems in the U.S. had 
to do with insufﬁcient housing. Property owners and managers, mortgage institutions and 
insurance companies made a difficult situation worse by openly discriminating against 
potential buyers or renters on the basis of color or ethnicity. In the year 2010 it is hard to 
imagine that a coalition of real estate agents, banks and insurance companies would ﬁght 
– openly, unapologetically – for the right to discriminate against people of color. But this 
is just what happened in California. 
Tyranny of the Californian majority 
In 1963, the California legislature passed the Rumford Fair Housing Act which prohibited 
racial discrimination in housing practices. The California Real Estate Commission imme-
diately started raising money to sponsor a referendum (referred to as Proposition 14)1 
which called for a revision to the state constitution that would allow property owners to 
continue to discriminate any way they pleased: 
Neither the State nor any subdivision or agency thereof shall deny, limit or abridge, 
directly or indirectly, the right of any person, who is willing or desires to sell, lease 
or rent any part or all of his real property, to decline to sell, lease or rent such property 
to such person or persons as he, in his absolute discretion, chooses. 
(Noel and Cheng 2009) 
That 1964 voter initiative passed with a 65 percent majority, thus nullifying the Rumford 
Act and “creating a California Constitutional right to discriminate against members of racial 
minority groups” (Oppenheimer 2020: 118). In turn, Proposition 14 was struck down when 
the California Supreme Court ruled it a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,2 and 
thus unconstitutional (ibid.). In May 1967, the Supreme Court of the U.S. afﬁrmed that 
decision.

----- Page 348 (native) -----
LINGUISTIC PROFILING AND FAIR HOUSING 
323 
In Oppenheimer’s history of California’s anti-discrimination legislation, he notes 
that the courts “acted with great courage, defying the will of the voters, to protect minority 
rights” (ibid.: 118). This is a perfect example of the concept of the tyranny of the majority. 
In the U.S. the founding fathers anticipated such problems by writing the Bill of Rights, 
which protects individuals even in the face of overwhelming public opinion. 
Subsequent legislation (most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1968, often referred to as 
the Fair Housing Act) extended protection to include a wider range of discriminatory 
behaviors and protected classes. 
The Ofﬁce of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO)3 has a website4 where it 
describes its purpose as the ofﬁce that administers and enforces federal laws and establishes 
policies that make sure all Americans have equal access to the housing of their choice. 
There are state organizations which perform similar functions, dozens of non-proﬁt civil-
rights organizations and a legion of fair housing advocates and activists who are deeply 
involved in the pursuit of equal housing for all. 
Actions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap 
that are speciﬁcally prohibited by law include the following: 
refusal to rent or sell housing; 
taking steps to making housing unavailable (a landlord or owner takes the property 
off the market to avoid potential renters or buyers on the basis of a protected category); 
setting different terms, conditions or privileges for sale or rental of a dwelling (for 
example, require people of a particular race to pay a larger security deposit); 
providing different housing services or facilities (the landlord prohibits some renters 
from using the garden or pool); 
falsely denying that housing is available for inspection, sale, or rental; 
for proﬁt, persuading owners to sell or rent (blockbusting) or denying anyone access 
to or membership in a facility or service (such as a multiple listing service) related to 
the sale or rental of housing; 
refusing to make a mortgage loan; 
refusing to provide information regarding loans; 
imposing different terms or conditions on a loan, such as different interest rates, points, 
or fees; 
discriminating in appraising property; 
refusing to purchase a loan; 
setting different terms or conditions for purchasing a loan; 
threatening, coercing, intimidating or interfering with anyone exercising a fair housing 
right or assisting others who exercise that right; 
advertising or making any statement that indicates a limitation or preference based on 
race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or handicap. This prohibition 
against discriminatory advertising applies to single-family and owner-occupied housing 
that is otherwise exempt from the Fair Housing. 
And still, housing discrimination is widespread. Reasons for this fall into two categories: 
(1) victim vulnerabilities; and (2) property owners, managers, or contractors looking for 
ways to increase proﬁts regardless of legality. 
In the ﬁrst case, victims of housing discrimination are often unaware of their rights, or 
how to pursue redress when rights have been violated. Weil (2009) conducted a long-term 
study of housing conditions for Latinos in Southern Louisiana shortly after Hurricane

LINGUISTIC PROFILING AND FAIR HOUSING 
Katrina. Latinos were especially vulnerable in the period following the disaster; when 
there was a lack of even rudimentary housing and tensions were high, employers – such 
as contractors who recruited Latinos speciﬁcally to work on reconstruction projects – were 
also primarily responsible for the allocation of housing. Added to these factors was 
insufﬁcient government oversight (ibid.: 491). 
A case in point is Natalia, a Latina teacher and a ﬂuent speaker of English who told 
Weil that prior to Katrina she had no basis for complaint: “If they felt like I was inferior, 
they didn’t let me know. But I have never felt embarrassed or humiliated or slighted in 
any way as a Hispanic.” Any reasonable interviewer, having established a good relationship 
with the informant, must take such information at face value. However, Natalia also took 
part in a discrimination audit which provided important additional data. 
Government and non-profit agencies who track housing discrimination will often 
perform an audit when discriminatory practices are suspected. For example, if a Korean-
American applies for a mortgage and is quoted an unusually high interest rate – and reports 
this – an Anglo tester is sent in to apply for the same mortgage (supplying the same 
information on the application). This process may be repeated a number of times with 
different testers. If sufﬁcient evidence can be documented, the bank or mortgage company 
may be charged with unlawful discrimination. 
In Natalia’s case, her experiences with rental agents was recorded and then compared 
to the experiences of an Anglo, non-Latina: 
Unbeknownst to [Natalia], she was discriminated against on several occasions; 
however, the discrimination was often masked by a friendly and seemingly accom-
modating voice . . . it is often difﬁcult today for an individual to know whether he or 
she has been treated unfairly, and as a result, the vast majority of discrimination cases 
go unreported. 
(ibid.: 493) 
With reﬁnements of the laws and widening of protections, property owners, landlords, 
bankers and sales people have become far more subtle in the techniques used to screen 
out renters or buyers whom they consider undesirable. The National Fair Housing 
Alliance pursues unethical real estate companies and rental agents because residential 
segregation “results in disparities in access to quality education, employment, home-
ownership and wealth accumulation for communities of color” (National Fair Housing 
Alliance 2009). 
One of the more insidious ways that owners and managers screen out applicants or 
buyers who are unwelcome is to do so over the phone, on the basis of accent (Figure 17.1). 
Heard but not seen 
John Baugh is a sociolinguist and a professor of linguistics whose primary research areas 
have to do with the social stratification of English (with a focus on African American 
Vernacular English) and with discriminatory practices toward individuals and groups who 
do not command the dominant linguistic norms of their communities. 
Some years ago Baugh began looking for an apartment for himself and his family in the 
vicinity of Stanford University, calling telephone numbers listed on real estate advertise-
ments, in the usual way of things. Baugh is African American; he grew up in urban Los

Angeles and Philadelphia with parents who were both university professors, and thus grew 
up comfortable in a variety of language communities. In his youth and adolescence Baugh 
acquired three varieties of English: he is a native speaker of a formal, academic English, 
of AAVE, and he also has a command of Chicano English. 
In contacting landlords about advertised rental properties by phone, Baugh used more 
formal, academic English and he was told that yes, he could come see the apartment. Only 
to be turned away with excuses once the landlord saw him in person.

----- Page 351 (native) -----
326 
LINGUISTIC PROFILING AND FAIR HOUSING 
Baugh was the same person on the phone and off, but the perception of him had shifted 
from a well-spoken, educated Anglo to a well-spoken, educated African American. With 
that shift, the apartment he wanted to see was no longer available. 
Here is direct evidence that the language subordination model is built on deception. 
The ideology says: sound like us and you’ll be one of us, no more trouble for you. Baugh 
does command what people think of as *SAE; but he is still discriminated against on the 
basis of race. 
Of course, the identification of social allegiances on the basis of language traits is a 
normal and natural practice for all human beings; variation is built into spoken language 
speciﬁcally to help us situate each other in social and geographic space. The problem starts 
when we draw conclusions and then use them to discriminate and exclude individuals from 
normal life activities on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin or any other protected 
category. 
In a long-term study funded by the Ford Foundation, Baugh and his associates looked 
at these issues closely. The initial question was a simple one, on the surface at least: Is it 
possible to tell a person’s race and/or ethnicity based on an individual’s speaking voice – 
without any visual clues at all?5 That is, are there speciﬁc phonological or phonetic features 
that are associated with a particular race or ethnicity, and if so, do speciﬁc traits trigger 
speciﬁc kinds of reactions? 
I had you at hello 
Baugh and his colleagues designed a series of four experiments to better understand some 
of the most basic aspects of linguistic profiling. In the first stage of this study, Baugh 
collected the data himself by systematically calling landlords to inquire about advertised 
apartments, targeting ﬁve speciﬁc areas in the San Francisco Bay area. In every case he 
used the same greeting: “Hello, I’m calling about the apartment you have advertised in 
the paper.” In order to avoid suspicion on the basis of idiosyncratic features, different 
return telephone numbers and pseudonyms were used for each of the three calls to each 
landlord.6 The hypothesis was that in communities where the population was predomi-
nantly Anglo, there would be fewer positive responses to inquiries made in AAVE or ChE. 
The second study was similar to the ﬁrst in that the same sentence was used, but this 
time twenty individuals who were native speakers of one of the targeted varieties of English 
recorded the sentence in question. Baugh’s three utterances were also recorded for the 
database. More than four hundred students at Stanford took part in this experiment, in 
which they listened to the recorded segments and made note of their best guesses in terms 
of race, ethnicity, and sex. 
The third and fourth experiments had to do with the measurement of very ﬁne phonetic 
and acoustic detail in order to identify how sensitive listeners are to cues well below the 
level of consciousness. The methodology here involved isolating the single word hello from 
Baugh’s three recordings. The reasons for limiting the experiment this way are important: 
We have several reasons for examining one word. This allowed us to hold external 
factors to a minimum. Second, it also illustrates how little speech is needed for dialect 
identiﬁcation. “Hello” is a self-contained utterance, making perceptual studies more 
natural. By focusing on one short word, we are able to hold utterance duration well 
below one second (x = 414 msec.), making it comparable to other studies already made.

----- Page 352 (native) -----
LINGUISTIC PROFILING AND FAIR HOUSING 
327 
Student participants were again asked to identify race, ethnicity and sex on the basis 
of listening to that single variable. 
(Purnell et al. 1999: 13) 
In each of these four experiments, the authors found that they had to reject the null 
hypothesis. That is, they began with the expectation that there would be no correlation 
between language features and discriminatory experiences. However, 70 percent of the 
time, listeners were able to identify race, ethnicity and sex on the basis of an utterance less 
than a second long (ibid.: 14). After analysis of the four experiments, the authors came to 
four clear, statistically signiﬁcant conclusions: 
1 
Dialect-based discrimination takes place. 
2 
Ethnic group afﬁliation is recoverable from speech. 
3 
Very little speech is needed to discriminate between dialects. 
4 
Some phonetic correlates or markers of dialects are recoverable from a very small 
amount of speech. 
(ibid.: 11) 
A human failing 
In the ﬁrst experiment described in Purnell et al. (1999), Baugh targeted ﬁve speciﬁc areas 
around the San Francisco Bay to see if the race/ethnicity distributions in those areas would 
serve as a predictor of linguistic proﬁling. The ﬁndings are laid out in Figure 17.2. 
Note ﬁrst that for each of the ﬁve areas, the population is broken down by race/ethnicity. 
So, for example, East Palo Alto has approximately equal numbers of Anglos, African 
Americans, and Chicanos/as, with a tendency toward Anglos. Palo Alto has very small 
populations of Chicanos/as and African Americans, and Woodside is even more exclusively 
Anglo. Oakland has the largest proportion of African Americans, while East Palo Alto has 
the largest populations of Chicanos/as. 
The lines superimposed over the bars indicate the number of times Baugh was able to 
successfully make an appointment to see an apartment. When he spoke ChE, his inquiry 
calls were successful as few as 20 percent of the time. The best response to ChE inquiries 
came from East Palo Alto, which is also home to the largest proportion of Chicanos. 
However, even in East Palo Alto Baugh’s ChE inquiries were successful only 60 percent 
of the time. Corollary to this is the fact that even in the two areas where Anglos are 
outnumbered by people of color (Oakland and East Palo Alto), Anglos have better success 
in booking these appointments. 
This is a reminder that housing discrimination is not strictly an Anglo phenomenon; 
there are many documented cases of such practices, of violence and civil rights violations 
from persons of all races and ethnicities. Consider the data in Table 17.1 from a study of 
the relationship between race/ethnicity and racial stereotypes. Individuals were asked to 
judge the ‘unintelligence’ of different groups.

Housing discrimination toward Muslims 
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, brought with them a surge in discriminatory 
acts – both passive-aggressive and violent – toward Americans of Middle Eastern ancestry. 
The Middle East is considered one of the Asian nations by the U.S. Census Bureau. In 
this case discriminatory focus is primarily on religion. 
The concept of a Muslim accent is less well formed than that of a Chinese or Swedish 
American, but it is still distinctive to many and becoming more so in the course of a decade 
of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

A family of Pakistani immigrants living in San Francisco public housing was improperly 
denied an emergency transfer to another apartment after someone broke into their home, 
desecrated their Quran, defaced their passports and shredded their traditional clothing, 
according to a federal court lawsuit. 
After the August 2005 incident – which took place during a time of intensiﬁed anti-
Muslim sentiment in the country and while the San Francisco Housing Authority was 
under court order to better protect tenants from hate-motivated crimes – agency ofﬁcials 
ruled that the break-in at Ashan Khan’s apartment was a simple burglary and didn’t qualify 
the family for an emergency apartment transfer, according to the family’s reports (Lagos 
2007). 
Summary 
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s National Fair Housing 
Alliance has been using phone auditing to examine suspected cases of housing discrimi-
nation linked to aural (rather than visual) traits with some success. Landlords advertising 
apartments, insurance companies offering low home insurance rates, banks eager to sell 
mortgages, in all aspects of the housing industry, the NFHA continues to ﬁnd evidence 
of linguistic proﬁling to the detriment of people of color and people who speak English 
as a second language. 
The growing body of literature on linguistic proﬁling produced by scholars, government 
agencies and non-proﬁt civil rights organizations points to a simple conclusion: Anglos 
are more likely to have calls returned; they hear a wider range of possibilities and may be 
offered monetary incentives; they are quoted better rates on insurance and mortgages 
before the persons making these decisions have ever checked references or credit ratings. 
But the investigation process is long, the legal system is slow, and the ﬁnes too insigniﬁcant 
to have any lasting or long-term effect. 
The ﬁrst and best line of defense is to make sure that people are aware of their rights 
and how to protect those rights. Equally important is to make others aware of linguistic 
proﬁling. 
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
Watch the advertisement produced by the Equal Housing Authority on linguistic proﬁling, 
in which an Anglo makes phone call after phone call about an advertisement for an 
apartment; with each call he uses a different stigmatized accent. An informal survey of 
my own indicates that the average person can identify all the accents (which does not, 
of course, mean that the accents are technically accurate; it may be that individuals 
recognize the portrayal of an accent). Asian and Middle Eastern accents are included, 
though there has been no formal investigation of how such accents are proﬁled in day-
to-day telephone interaction. How might such an investigation look? 
Imagine that you have a friend or coworker who applied for an apartment and has been 
the victim of linguistic proﬁling, in your view of things. He or she is reluctant to register

a complaint. Investigate the process and put together the information and forms that your 
friend will need to pursue the issue. Consider the following issues: 
Does this process strike you as reasonable, or overly complicated? 
Why might an otherwise intelligent, well-established individual be reluctant to pursue 
equal treatment under the law? 
Read some of the articles about linguistic proﬁling provided. How would you describe 
the tone: Any hint of an ideological leaning in one direction or another? 
Can you recall any instances of linguistic profiling over the phone? Judgments made 
about the stranger on the other end? Reactions?

5  On the one hand this seems like a deceptively easy question, but in fact it is complicated 
by the possibility of racist applications. In the suggested readings at the end of this 
section there are a number of articles which explore linguistic profiling within the 
context of the law and court system. 
6  According to Purnell et al. (1999): 
This procedure of anonymity parallels legally approved practices of testers used 
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and similar 
organizations when suspecting discriminating practices by landlords (e.g., City 
of Chicago v. Matchmaker Real Estate Sales Center, 1992; Johnson v. Jerry Pals 
Real Estate, 1973; United States v. Youritan Construction Company, 1975).

Conclusion

Civil (dis)obedience and the shadow of language 
Most of the greatest evils that man has inﬂicted upon man have come through people 
feeling quite certain about something which, in fact, was false. 
Bertrand Russell, cited in Haught (1996: 149) 
Marge, it takes two people to lie. One to lie, and one to listen. 
Homer Simpson 
The process of language subordination targets not all variation, not all language varieties, 
but only those which are emblematic of differences in race, ethnicity, homeland, or other 
social allegiances which have been found to be less than good enough. Dedicated 
practitioners of language subordination do not complain about most of the variation which 
is active in U.S. English. There has never been an outcry about Chicagoans’ inability to 
distinguish between “merry,” “Mary” and “marry.” Nor are there essays in local papers 
on the stupidity and unworthiness of people who say “cawfee” rather than “cah-fee” or 
“coo-off-ee.” People do not lose jobs because they wait on line rather than in line. There 
may be an occasional ruffled feather about the use of hopefully or healthy, about split 
inﬁnitives and dangling participles, “who” vs. “whom,” but such debates – while often loud 
and sometimes acrimonious – eventually fade, because these are points of language 
variation leading to change which are largely completed, and solidly entrenched in the 
vernacular. 
But people do lose jobs and school children are belittled because their native language 
makes it difficult for them to differentiate between /l/ and /r/ sounds; because their 
sentence intonations are Latino; because they say “y’all” rather than “all of you,” “aks” 
rather than “ask.” 
The demand that the disempowered assimilate linguistically and culturally to please the 
empowered is – purely in linguistic terms – an impossibility. A person’s accent (the bundle 
of distinctive intonation and phonological features) is ﬁxed or hard-wired in the mind, 
and once past a certain age it can only be very laboriously changed, to a very limited degree, 
regardless of commitment, intelligence, and resources. Thus the constant public debate 
on good English, on the one right English, is as fruitless an exercise as the hypothetical 
congressional debate on the ideal height and weight for all adults. We cannot purge 
language of variation linked to social difference, but more important than that undeniable 
fact: it should not matter. 
If as a nation we are agreed that it is not acceptable or good to discriminate on the 
grounds of skin color or ethnicity, gender or age, then by logical extension it is equally 
unacceptable to discriminate against language traits which are intimately linked to an 
individual’s sense and expression of self.

CONCLUSION 
333 
But people are judged on the basis of language form rather than language content, every 
day. Without hesitation or contemplation, workers are turned away, children are cor-
rected, people are made to feel small and unimportant in public settings. The process of 
language subordination is so deeply rooted, so well established, that we do not see it for 
what it is. We make no excuses for preferences which exclude on the basis of immutable 
language traits. 
Having established that this process works, and having looked hard at how it works for 
both the powered and the disempowered, a logical question has not yet been raised: what 
now? 
When discussing this question with my students – a racially and ethnically mixed group 
of bright young people of both sexes, well educated, thoughtful – this is where the deadlock 
will occur. Some, enraged by the practices they have studied and observed (and perhaps 
experienced), will demand that we stop all pretenses in the school to teach “standard” 
English. They contemplate passive resistance and large-scale civil disobedience, and a 
United States in which the equation between national unity and linguistic homogeneity 
has been examined and discarded as untenable and unfair. Others point out that because 
children are still in the language acquisition stage, they should theoretically be able to 
acquire more than one variety of English – and that this should become a rule. Idealism 
does not put food on the table, this argument goes. 
It is a strong argument. Economic rationalizations are the most often raised, most loudly 
voiced, and the most persuasive of all common-sense arguments used to coerce the few 
into the ways of the many: Assimilation is the price of success. 
Comparison of Figures 18.1 and 18.2 makes it clear that the U.S. has always been and 
will always be ethnically, racially, and linguistically heterogeneous, but it is equally true 
Figure 18.1 Distribution of the U.S. population by national origin, over time

that the population ﬁgures are shifting. In a democracy based on majority-rule, power 
relationships cannot be static and will always be expressed – in part – by means of language 
ideology. 
The question is, can this unbroken circle of intimidation truly not be broken, or do we 
like things the way they are? Language serves as a convenient excuse to turn away. Are we 
unwilling to consider a nation in which the cost of success is achievement measured by 
other, fairer, means? 
Ideology is most effective when its workings are least visible, and standard language 
ideology in the U.S. functions like a silent but efficient machine. Its practitioners are 
terribly skillful at coercing consent and participation from those people and groups who 
suffer the most under the weight of language ideology. Thus the most factual stand: every 
language is in fact completely viable and functional, therefore we do not need and should 
not attempt standardization – seems to be doomed. 
And if that is the case, if human nature will allow nothing else, then it is only common 
sense to remember that power will shift, and one day – most likely within the lifetimes of 
those reading this book – the power of the majority will shift too. Putting inclusive, 
respectful, cooperative language policies in place now is the ﬁrst step toward making sure 
they are still in place when you, personally, need them. 
In the meantime, a realistic goal must be a much smaller one: to make people aware of 
the process of language subordination. To draw their attention to the misinformation, to 
expose false reasoning and empty promises to hard questions. 
If in the face of clarity and truth about standardization, the way it works, and its social 
connections and meanings, peripheralized language speakers and communities choose to 
try to assimilate to linguistic (and cultural) norms of another group, then that is a choice 
freely made that must be respected. But at this time, there is little or no truth in advertising 
the process of language standardization. Right now, people attempt to conform and to 
assimilate because they are inundated with promises and threats if they do not. The threats 
are real: the evidence is at hand in the experiences of the people whose stories are told 
here. The promises, however, are not so real. Because discrimination on the basis of

CONCLUSION

language has not to do with the language itself, but with the social circumstances and 
identities attached to that language, discrimination will not go away when the next 
generation has assimilated. Mainstream U.S. English is a ﬂimsy cover to hide behind in 
the face of serious intent to exclude on the basis of race or ethnicity. 
Eleanor Roosevelt’s statement on the connection between inferiority and cooperation 
is one that I have thought about for a long time, in the writing of this book. It captures 
two basic elements of the language subordination process: First, one person or group must 
want to make another person or group believe that their language – and hence their social 
allegiances and priorities – are inferior. Second, that targeted person or group must 
become complicit in the process. 
But it also raises the important issue of language system and language content, or 
linguistic and social grammaticality addressed in the ﬁrst chapter. I raise this topic here 
because I anticipate a common response to the arguments set forth in this book will be 
that I am – as I have been called in the past – a language anarchist. One of those lax, liberal 
types, for whom anything goes. Who has no respect for language or the traditions of the 
past, and no interest in teaching those traditions to children. No interest in aesthetics, and 
an unwillingness to talk of quality in spoken language, for fear that somebody will be 
marginalized. 
In fact, I will state very clearly that in my opinion, it is not a sin against mankind to have 
standards and preferences about the spoken language. As a product of the institutions that 
I have written about in this book, I have been exposed to stereotypes for my whole life. I 
hope that I have learned to look beyond them to see and to hear the person behind the 
cultural expectations, but even then, I have preferences. I can, and I do, choose among 
storytellers. I can decide that Jane tells a joke better than Joan. That political candidate 
Park is better than candidate Goldstein in off-the-cuff debate. One song lyric may delight 
me while another falls ﬂat. 
As a speaker of a variety of U.S. English which is not stigmatized, on occasion I feel 
inferior about my own language. I can recall times when I failed to make a point because 
I could not articulate my thoughts clearly. I have used too many words when a few would 
have sufﬁced. Most of all, I have felt inferior on those occasions when I have been moved 
by spoken language which is clear, precise, vivid, and following from this, effective for me 
personally. But because I belong to the social (and hence, to the language) mainstream 
which isolates me from the process of subordination, any feelings of inferiority are of my 
own making. Other value systems are not forced on me; I am allowed the consolation of 
my mother tongue. I am free of the shadow of language, and subject only to the standards 
that I accept for myself. 
Language subordination is not about relative standards and preferences in the way 
language is used. Language subordination does not say: Joan can’t tell a joke, but rather 
that Joan is not worth listening to, because her English makes it clear that she was born 
on the Bayou, or in Harlem, Puerto Rico, Hong Kong or on the Pine Ridge Reservation. 
Whether Joan is the best or the worst teller of jokes ever born, some people will never 
know because they will not listen to what she has to say: how she says it is enough to know 
that it is unworthy of their consideration. 
Language subordination is about taking away a basic human right: to speak freely in 
the mother tongue without intimidation, without standing in the shadow of other 
languages and peoples. To resist the process, passively or actively, is to ask for recognition, 
and acknowledgement. It is a demand for the simple right to be heard.
